let's talk about the herb ashwagandha I really like this herb I use it in one of
my adrenal formulas and it's really good for stress so let's just kind of go
through what it can do the main effect of this herb has to do with this final
chemical called withanolides okay this is a phytochemical and there's quite a few of
them I think there's like 300 different types is a steroid compound interesting
because your adrenal glands are also made from steroids and ashwagandha has been
around for a very very long time at least 3,000 years it's an adaptogen so
it helps you adapt and counter stress now of course the best thing to do is to
isolate where that stress is coming from or who is causing the stress and deal
with that because I've noticed them even when I was in practice that unless you
really fix the stress you can keep taking vitamins and herbs all the time
and it'll help a tiny bit but you really have to find the source of where that's
coming from I know presently there's a lot of fear
going on related to a virus and the problem with that is a very interesting
problem because you have this thing which is being promoted to be everywhere
you have to avoid it it's invisible and once you get it you can die so the best
thing if you have that fear is to learn more about it be educated on your immune
system strengthen the immune system and that way you can be bulletproof against
that threat and the reason I'm bringing that up is just because the fear itself
has an emotion can literally cripple the immune system it can make you more
susceptible to getting the virus and I will put some videos down that talk
about how to strengthen your immune system it has anti-inflammatory
properties so it's really good for arthritis and autoimmune conditions but
of course anything that I say in here is not meant to diagnose or give you a
treatment for an illness check with your doctor I'm just talking about the
effects that this could potentially create anti-anxiety
has immunoregulatory so it's good for the immune system because it's lowering
stress and stress is probably the worst thing for the immune system and I
already mentioned the arthritis and autoimmune it also can potentially lower your
cortisol which is behind the stress it can actually help your blood sugars it
can improve insulin sensitivity and most people take ashwagandha simply for this
to lower their stress and anxiety in one study there was an improvement of 69
percent versus only 11 percent in a placebo trial i'll put the link down
below and also as far as you mood it can potentially improve depression another
study that I read there was a 79 percent improvement versus a 10 percent
improvement for a placebo so that's pretty significant it also has a
potential for increasing testosterone that may relate to improving muscle
strength and even muscle mass because testosterone is connected with that by
the way the more stress that you have the more cortisol that's elevated the
less testosterone you're gonna have okay we already mentioned the
anti-inflammatory effects better brain function better focus because you're
less stressed decrease pain and improve sleep so ashwagandha is an incredible
herb to improve your stress and it has very minimal side effects if any all
right if you want more information about how to bulletproof your immune system I
put it right here check it out

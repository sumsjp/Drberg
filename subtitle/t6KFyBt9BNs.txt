so I'm gonna explain in this video why as you age these earlobes start growing
okay and your nose starts growing and your eyebrows start growing excessively
you've seen older men with these bushy eyebrows long ears in the nose and of
course the hair is out of the ear and the nose why is that what is happening
is there something we can do about it or is it just inevitable we're just gonna
have to cope with it well the answer is yes it's inevitable you have something
to look forward to but here's the thing your bones actually stop growing in the
early 20s maybe a little bit before that okay but the cartilage will continue to
grow a very very small amount as you age and the tip of your nose is all
cartilage so are your ears and there's also a bit of a lack of connective
tissue so you don't have something to hold that cartilage together so things
start to droop and sag all over the place but then you also have another
thing going on for men primarily you have this spike in its ana called DHT
DHT is a very powerful type of testosterone and there's an enzyme that
will start to convert testosterone to DHT and that will lead to hair loss male
pattern baldness but at the same time you get an increase of hair growth in
the eyebrows in the hairs in the ear and the hairs in your nose and even in the
size of the prostate so that's another thing you have to look forward to just
make sure that you trim them on a regular basis now there's an enzyme
inhibitor it's called 5-alpha reductase inhibitor
and it just so happens to be in pumpkin seeds and it's in quite a few other
things which I'll show you a video but this enzyme will slow down the process
of this GHG and that may result in some improvements in other parts of the body
so anyway I wanted to clear up that little mystery and if you're interested
in knowing what will decrease DHT I put a link right here check it out

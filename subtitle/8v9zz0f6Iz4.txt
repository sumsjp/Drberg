never forget this is years ago
but i was doing this gallbladder
flush to flush out all my stones because
um i read something where you can drink
olive oil lemon juice
and take beet tablets
to flush out hundreds of gallstones
right and clean your body of these toxic
stones
so i poured this it might have been i
don't know 18 ounces but it could have
been 12 ounces but this huge glass of
olive oil okay
and i put about two ounces of lemon
juice in it
and then i had a handful of beet pills
okay
so i figured i'd just go ahead and do it
all together so i chugged down the beet
pills
slugged down the olive oil slash lemon
juice
and laid on my right side but before i
could lay on my right side these beet
pills solidified
in my throat
and i couldn't breathe so i almost
died i don't know if you've ever had
this sensation where you ate something
and it kind of got stuck in your throat
and you couldn't breathe
that's what happened so i panicked and i
finally relaxed and i got it through
and then i laid on my right side for
about a half hour and what was supposed
to happen was the gallbladder supposed
to flush all these stones out so to make
a long story short um
in the toilet
i noticed these round little green balls
and i'm like wow it worked i flushed out
all these stones so at the time i didn't
know much about health okay i just i was
just doing all sorts of cleanses to try
to help my body but here's the thing you
need to know
stones don't float okay i mean these
gallstones are rocks
they sink and
what i was really looking at
was these little
balls of
bile salts okay so what this so-called
cleanse did is flush out my bile okay so
i i got rid of all my bile and by the
way as i'm about to teach you when you
lose your bile you increase your risk
for getting
stones
so a gallbladder stone is created when
you have a super concentrated amount of
cholesterol
with a low amount of bile
normally the bile is supposed to
emulsify the cholesterol and keep things
thinned so it doesn't form into a stone
it doesn't crystallize but when you
don't have enough bile salts because of
a cleanse like this or other reasons and
then you develop stones
so this gallbladder slash gallstone
flush
actually increased my risk of getting
stones so let me just explain something
you have the liver okay
which makes bile
the bile is then released through these
little tubes called ducts
okay and it starts to drain into this
thing called gallbladder and the
gallbladder is a sac that holds bile it
doesn't make bile it holds the bile and
so the bile can be concentrated so the
next time you eat it can be contracted
and that bile can be released into the
small intestine
so it can start to help to break down
fats and with the help of the pancreas
that then comes in with certain enzymes
like lipase
to break it down to a even smaller level
so it can be absorbed so you need
everything functioning in the liver and
gallbladder and the pancreas to make
everything work right and so there is
also a hormone that causes this
contraction of the gallbladder and so
what triggers the hormone that contracts
the gallbladder are
fats okay fatty acids
protein
and
hydrochloric acid
from your stomach because you just ate
so every time you eat you actually have
this release of this bile that's going
to help you start extracting
fat soluble vitamins omega-3 fatty acids
and other fatty acids now if you have
not noticed
carbohydrates
do not help you release bile they're not
a trigger for the contraction of the
gallbladder so what does that mean it
means basically if you're doing like a
lot of carbs you're not getting the help
of the gallbladder too much it's more
the fat the protein and also
hydrochloric acid now a really common
confusion about gallstones is that
people think that eating a high-fat diet
will cause gallstones well it all
depends on what's happening with your
bile if you're producing enough bile
with the fat you're fine but fat in
itself
causes a release of bile not the
formation of a stone and let me just
tell you again a stone is formed when
you have too much concentrated
cholesterol and not enough bile salts
one of the top remedies for gallstones
is taking purified bile salts so instead
of asking the question what causes a
gallstone a better question would be
what decreases our bile
production and release and so i'm going
to go down the list okay number one
estrogen
can inhibit
bile from being produced and released
this is why women who are pregnant who
have a lot of estrogen are at risk for
getting gallstones this is why women who
take birth control pills or start taking
hormone replacement therapy specifically
estrogen replacement therapy
are at risk for gulf stones this is why
women who are estrogen dominant tend to
get more gallstones
than if they're not estrogen dominant
now the next thing that can cause a
decreased bioproduction is very
interesting it's a actually being on a
low-fat diet so if you're a vegan and
you don't consume much fat or you're
just on a low-fat diet your risk for
gallstones are going up because it's the
fatty acids that help you produce and
release
bile so the myth of eating too much fat
will cause gallstones is
just a myth all right the next thing
that will affect your bile production is
having too much cortisol from stress or
prednisone okay a lot of people with
inflammatory conditions are taking
prednisone
uh synthetic version of cortisol and
that can increase the risk of gallstones
all right number four and this is very
important too much insulin
or
insulin resistance
or
a fatty liver which usually comes from
that
and if you have a fatty liver you can't
produce as much bile because there's not
as much liver to produce the bile
but insulin in general and insulin
resistance which usually happen at the
same time
is a very common cause of
lowered bile production this is why a
diabetic has an increased risk of
getting gallstones this is why people
that are overweight are more at a risk
for a gallstone and this is why people
who eat too many carbs are at risk for
getting a gallstone all right next thing
on the list is a loss of bile let's say
you have chronic diarrhea
that is going to cause a loss of bile or
you had gastric bypass
which you're going to be at risk for
getting gallstones because you're doing
a bypass of your intestine
stomach and that's going to decrease
bile and this last one is actually
fascinating
bile is made from cholesterol so
anything that lowers cholesterol like
statins will put you at risk for having
lowered bile and increasing the risk of
gallstones so i hope this increased your
awareness
of gallstones in general and what you
should and should not do but i just want
to mention olive oil is extremely
healthy to consume but probably not in
large quantities like drinking like 12
ounces not the best idea now lemon juice
and apple cider vinegar are really good
for not only breaking down stones and
producing more bile
but gallstones as well as kidney stones
and i think the best video for you to
watch right now is
my video on bile salts it's actually
quite interesting check it out i put it
right here

now there's a state in mexico
that consumes on average
2.2
liters of coca-cola every single day
and i'm not kidding
it's chiapas mexico
they even incorporate coca-cola into
various religious rituals now 2.2 liters
of coca-cola every single day is five
times the national average of mexico now
of course if we take a look at the three
countries that consume the most
coca-cola in the world
mexico is number one
us comes in number two and brazil number
three now i also found in chiapas
that three percent of the babies are
given coca-cola
so obviously there's a very severe lack
of awareness or education on what
coca-cola can do to our bodies
down in chapis mexico diabetes deaths
rank number two
behind heart disease now i wonder what
causes heart disease
well could it be the same thing did you
realize between 2011 and 2015
both coca-cola and pepsi cola
sponsored
95 national health organizations
including health clinics
medical facilities to support the fight
against
the obesity epidemic
now isn't that like putting out a fire
with gasoline i mean their pr campaigns
their public relations campaigns are
incredible they used to sponsor for
eight years
the american dietetic association
with their continued educational credits
which
that's amazing because if you're going
to sponsor an organization like that i
mean wouldn't that potentially alter
what they recommend or or even what
they're taught in school
nah they wouldn't do that
now check this out 2.2 liters of
coca-cola equals
208 grams of sugar okay that's 52
teaspoons of sugar a day now let that
sink in 52
teaspoons of sugar now that's not even
including what else they ate i mean
they're probably eating tortillas
they're probably eating other carbs
maybe other sweetened things like juice
and things like that this is just from
coca-cola incredible so whether they're
using high fructose corn syrup or just
regular sugar which is a combination of
fructose and glucose
the fructose part
does not lower
ghrelin which is the hunger hormone okay
so it's not going to
satisfy the person they can drink a lot
without the feeling that they had too
much
and the fructose part of this sugar
has some unique
things about it it really is similar to
consuming alcohol for your liver because
all of your cells in your body cannot
deal with fructose only the liver so it
forces the liver to have the deal with
this fructose and create a lot of
problems not just with the fatty liver
but with insulin resistance and with
this comes a whole series of additional
symptoms
and then we have the glucose right so
you're consuming this empty
carbohydrate which is going to deplete
your calcium
your vitamin c
your b1
d3
zinc
magnesium
and especially potassium
if you're going to drink that much
liquid candy you're going to deplete
your potassium and create a condition
called
hypokalemia now here are the symptoms
with low potassium number one higher
pulse rate number two weak muscles
there's even a condition where you can
go paralyze in your lower extremity if
you have lower potassium
arrhythmias
high blood pressure and even
constipation then they had phosphoric
acid and they mainly do it for the
flavor to decrease the bacterial and
mold counts
but the problem is phosphoric acid is a
very corrosive acid it's going to eat up
your bones it's going to eat up your
teeth and definitely create cavities
and now we have an increased risk of
osteoporosis and also a problem with
absorbing zinc and iron
so that's phosphoric acid okay and then
of course they have caffeine about
149.6 milligrams of caffeine
and then we have the caramel coloring
right now you might think
caramel coloring is not that bad but
it creates something called advanced
glycation
end products that is a compound where
you're binding
a protein with a sugar or a fat with a
sugar
and it's unusable now and that's even
like a measurement of the a1c where the
proteins are glycated okay in your
hemoglobin so it's basically damaged
protein that cannot be used
and that's involved with so many chronic
degenerative diseases
and it's a biomarker for aging so you're
going to add this caramel flavoring that
originates from i think they have it
from either like a sugar from a corn or
something and then they heat it and it
creates all sorts of issues i mean i
can't think of a more of a deadly
combination between these ingredients
there's absolutely nothing in this drink
that benefits you at all now since we're
on the topic of sugar i created a really
interesting video on sugar that i think
you should check out i put it up right
here

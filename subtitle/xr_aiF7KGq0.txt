hi guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the difference between ketosis
and ketoacidosis they're not the same so many people they don't want to go into ketosis
because they think it's dangerous because of the they assume because it has the word keto it's
the same thing it's not ketoacidosis is a very dangerous disease that happens when you're a type
1 diabetic when you don't make any more insulin okay the insulin is zero you don't make it and so
the it's out of control it's uncontrolled insulin or blood sugar so the blood sugars go screaming
high because you have no insulin to bring it down okay and what happens is that sense ketones
are acidic the pH becomes very much of a problem so you have excessive thirst you have urination
coming out through your body like too much urination you're completely dehydrated you lose
your electrolytes you're fatigued your breathing is off so but if we look at your all the amount
of ketones it's like a massive amount it's like 20 okay now look at ketosis is like between 1 & 8
it's a smaller amount of mild fat burning okay so we're not getting the mass amounts of ketones
going into blood it's controlled through diet you don't have very many symptoms may be some slight
adaptation symptoms a little fatigue but if you took B vitamins or potassium that would clear right up
there's low amounts of insulin but it's still there and the cells are getting nutrition low
amounts of sugar your blood sugars are good so I just wanted to show you that it's totally healthy
this is unhealthy they're not the same even though they have the same first four letters but they're
not the same alright thanks for watching I'll see you next video hey guys thank you so much

now there are seven warning signs of an
iodine deficiency you may be familiar
with a thyroid problem if you're low
iodine you can actually create a
hypothyroid condition and the various
signs and symptoms of that would be
hair loss thinning of the hair lethargy
depression
dry hair dry skin
as well as weight gain
and cold intolerance you do not tolerate
cold and by the way like in the us alone
there's like 10 million people who have
hypothyroidism in europe it's 40 million
people and just so you know 90 of all
hypothyroidism
is more autoimmune and so it may not be
an iodine deficiency
however
iodine deficiency in general is very
very common
1.88 billion people on this planet have
an iodine deficiency so it's quite a few
people one of the best ways to know for
sure
if you are low on iodine
i've talked about the patch test where
you put a little drop of iodine on your
skin and you see if it gets absorbed
but if you really wanted to do an
accurate test to find out if you have an
iodine deficiency
you'd want to measure your thyroid
stimulating hormone because that's a
really good indicator to know
what's happening at the level between
the pituitary and your thyroid simply
because the thyroid is an iodine hog so
it's going to start hogging up all the
iodine and so if there's a deficiency of
thyroid hormones you won't get this
feedback loop to turn off the thyroid so
the pituitary just keeps putting out
more thyroid stimulating hormones so
it's going to be higher and that's a
really good indication to know if you're
really deficient in iodine and relating
to that as far as the numbers go
you want it to be under four
but some institutions are bringing that
number lower like 2.5 there's some
interesting data on that that might be
true but in this video i want to talk
mainly about the symptoms that you may
not be aware of that are related to an
iodine deficiency okay
number one intellectual disability
that's right your cognitive function
diminishes greatly when you don't have
iodine in adults and in children in fact
if you're deficient in iodine your iq
could go down by 15 points if a child is
deficient it can go down by 13 points if
you add to this an
iron deficiency in a child
that can bring it another seven points
lowered so you're talking 20 points
lowered iq from a simple mineral
deficiency and not just a mineral it's a
trace mineral and what's really bizarre
to me is that we only need these tiny
tiny
trace amounts of this mineral and if
you're deficient the consequences are
not tiny they are huge so this really
involves your ability to solve problems
your advancement in your job
and it can relate to your future success
number two
infertility now
if you take a look at the body's main
purpose its purpose is to survive
reproduce and continue okay and so this
little symptom of infertility is not so
little it's actually
a huge symptom for the body in its
purpose to reproduce and so there's a
huge importance in this connection
between
having this little trace mineral and
having the ability to reproduce
if an infant is deficient okay in iodine
or if a mother is deficient while she's
carrying a baby the child is very very
vulnerable to developing hearing loss
because
out of all the parts of the brain okay
the part of the brain that needs the
most
oxygen
the most metabolism
and the most iodine which they're all
connected
is the auditory centers and so if a
mother is deficient in this one trace
mineral the child can end up not being
able to hear or having hearing
deficiencies and before fibrocystic
breast now
why would an iodine deficiency show up
in the breast well because iodine has a
very big importance of regulating excess
amount of estrogen and when you have too
much estrogen and not enough iodine you
can develop like these mini little
cysts
either in the breast tissue or in the
ovary and as a side note if you have
fibrocystic breast you should be taking
iodine as a supplement and it works very
effectively all right number five heavy
periods now why would you have the heavy
period well because you're estrogen
dominant and iodine can help regulate
that and it can help regulate your
periods and as a side note too
this doesn't work all the time but i'd
say about 50 of the time it can also
help hot flashes all right number six
and this is interesting having a
deficiency of iodine can reduce your
productivity your ability
to achieve something in children and
adults and i know what you're thinking
this probably explains a lot of things
that's happening
nowadays with a certain percent of the
population but iodine can help people
increase their ability to get things
done all right number seven brain damage
now
now wait a second an iodine deficiency
causing brain damage i thought you'd
have to have physical trauma to cause
brain damage well guess what if you
don't have enough iodine all sorts of
things occur because iodine is essential
for certain enzymes that
not just create brain tissue
but also repair brain tissue and if
you're deficient you actually develop
brain damage in fact it's the number one
cause of brain damage in children
fascinating
now i know you're thinking right now
well what foods are in iodine
what causes
an iodine deficiency
i've done a whole other video about that
but i will just touch on it briefly the
number one cause of iodine deficiency is
not necessarily related to not getting
enough iodine from your diet okay i want
to primarily focus on number three
goitrogen foods
these are foods that can cause a goiter
which is swelling of your thyroid
usually because of an iodine deficiency
so what's interesting is this you could
be getting enough dietary iodine but
consuming these foods at the same time
and end up with an iodine deficiency and
creating a lot of problems so this point
right right here number three goitrogen
foods
is the most important information okay
and out of these foods that can deplete
iodine
cassava is the number one that has the
ability to block iodine why because in
addition to its ability to bind to
iodine and lock it up it also has two
additional chemicals that can also
bind in a potent way to iodine
hydrocyanic acid which then turns into
this theocyanate
which is a very strong and potent binder
to iodine so because of these two
chemicals right here
it is not good to consume a lot of
cassava simply because it can block
iodine so unless you're consuming a lot
of iodine okay you're probably going to
be deficient there is certain parts of
the world that consume a lot of cassava
in their diet and this is one of the
reasons why large populations are
deficient in
iodine now you also have soy
and corn
and canola okay
which also block
iodine and take a while to guess what
they feed animals okay
soy corn and sometimes canola but if you
actually feed animals this food you can
actually create deficiencies in the
animals so here you are thinking well
you know i don't consume soy i don't
consume corn i don't consume cassava
i'm good to go but you're consuming the
animals that live off these foods
now also cruciferous foods that would be
the cabbage the broccoli the brussels
sprouts things like that now i've done
videos on this and there's two points i
want to make on it if you're steaming or
cooking these foods as in the
cauliflower or steaming the broccoli or
cooking the cabbage it's going to
greatly reduce the effect of binding to
iodine also you would have to consume a
lot of cruciferous to create a
deficiency so
this is not at the top of the list okay
now peanuts and pine nuts also can bind
with iodine in large amounts they are
not the strongest foods that will do it
but i wanted to put it on the list and
you also have millet
and rice that can also bind with iodine
so this is why
there's a larger population that are
deficient in iodine in india
south east asia south america as well as
africa
so what are the best foods for iodine
the number one best food for iodine
especially if someone's pregnant
would be
shellfish okay
then
fish
anything out of the sea okay
like seek help that would be good
you also have eggs have iodine organ
meats have iodine nuts have a moderate
amount of iodine but believe it or not
vegetables and fruits are not high in
the list with iodine so if someone's
consuming soy
corn
millet other grains
with cassava vegetables
fruit and no animal products no eggs no
cheese
they can easily end up with an iodine
deficiency now this is an interesting
topic but this next video is even more
interesting it's the seven surprising
reasons why you are deficient in iodine
that go even beyond what i just talked
about check it out i put it right here

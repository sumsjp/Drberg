let's talk about the hypothalamus what is the hypothalamus well it only represents
one percent of your entire brain but it's one of the most active parts of your brain
it's half gland and half nervous system it's half endocrine system and half autonomic nervous system
the endocrine system makes actual hormones as its communication and then the autonomic
nervous system uses neurotransmitters as its communication and this includes both the
flight or fight sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic or rest and digest
you can kind of look at the autonomic nervous system as not necessarily an on off switch
but a dimmer switch because so it turns up gradually certain functions and turns them
down like in blood pressure right you just kind of go up a little bit or come back down and so the
hypothalamus controls a lot of things urination appetite temperature stress reproduction fluid
salt glucose levels sleep cycles metabolism smell blood pressure thirst growth and sex so
the hypothalamus really is all about homeostasis because here you have all these sensors on the
surface of your body you have sensors in your blood vessels to measure blood pressure so you
have these little sensors in your tongue that will tell the rest of the digestion what's coming down
to be able to prepare for that enzymes acids bile salts things like that you have also sensors in
your in your cells to monitor how much fluid that you need inside and outside so there's a lot of
this sensory information going into the body and then it's causing this gland to make adjustments
so basically this gland is part of homeostasis it's like a thermostat that either increases or
decreases the function but the overall goal is to keep things at a constant okay so it's all about
balance it's all about energy balance and when i'm talking about that balance i'm talking about
you know your temperature being 98.6 also there's certain amounts of electrolytes
inside and outside the cell your glucose should be at a certain constant level you should sleep
for a period of time blood pressure 180 over 60 so the goal of hypothalamus is to respond
to sensory information that's coming in from the environment to make adjustments to the entire body
and adapt to what's happening out here for the goal of creating homeostasis or balance so let's
say it's hot outside right your body's going to start sweating to adapt to that temperature so
we're not overheated so we can do a cool down like let's say for example we're going to run up a hill
well we need to quickly increase the blood pressure to make sure that we have oxygen up to
our brain because if our blood pressure doesn't go up there's not enough oxygen to run to our
certain parts of our body and will collapse and so the hypothalamus is really a mini computer and it
sends its information down to the pituitary out to other glands and that's the endocrine system
as well as through the autonomic nervous system now what's interesting about hypothalamus is that
you can develop inflammation in the hypothalamus and that comes from what they call over nutrition
i like that word over nutrition you have too much nutrition too many calories i don't know
why they're calling it over nutrition when in fact those calories are probably too many carbohydrate
calories that's kind of a weird name for over nutrition too many carbohydrates right because
if you have over nutrition you get obese and you develop something called metabolic syndrome
that comes from inflammation so too many carbohydrates
will cause the hypothalamus to become inflamed and then cause you to get metabolic syndrome which is
high blood pressure a slower metabolism you get a gut you start retaining fluid
your glucose starts going up you get sleep apnea you become a pre-diabetic so you're going to be
thirsty all the time right you're going to urinate excessively especially five or six times a night
you're going to be always hungry you have a decrease in testosterone which lowers your sex
drive you lose your growth hormone which is your fat burning hormone and you may find that your
metabolic set point is too high so let's say for example um you're trying to lose weight and you
just cannot get down below 180. your goal is to get down to 130 but your set point is 180 and your
body just fights it this is exactly where your body is going to stay and if you try to get below
that your body's going to fight it so your set point really is all about having this right here
the metabox syndrome and that it really is high levels of insulin and what's really behind that is
insulin resistance so how do you get rid of this right here you get rid of inflammation you simply
stop consuming the excessive amount of carbohydrates you get on a healthy keto plan
you do intermittent fasting you start to lose weight you reverse this and then things start
becoming back into balance so by getting on the right diet you can create huge effects not just
on your endocrine system but the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamus is simply a combination
of both of those systems hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put
a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

okay guys we're going to talk about LDL this is so called bad cholesterol
everyone's afraid of it stands for low density lipoproteins I'm going to want
to clear up some confusion on what this is it's not really cholesterol it's a
protein carrier because cholesterol doesn't mix with water too well so it
needs to be shuttled through a little truck or a bus
so LDL low-density lipoprotein it's not cholesterol it has cholesterol in it but
it's just a protein shell okay now the reason why people consider this bad is
simply because it carries cholesterol to the arteries and then the HDL the good
cholesterol take the cholesterol out of the arteries and goes back to the liver
okay but let's just talk about cholesterol in general as I've said in
the other videos your body makes cholesterol every single cell in your
body makes it your liver makes a thousand milligrams the rest of the
cells make 2,000 milligrams so total at 3,000 milligrams every single day okay
so your body needs it so if you have high LDL and you're scared of that
here's here's here's the facts the real purpose of LDL is not to cause damage
it's like it's like a something that directly binds in actin activates in
activates bacterial toxins okay it prevents the damage from toxins from
microbes it's there to help heal the cell okay that's what it's there in fact
it really tries to interact inactivate Staphylococcus aureus which is caused by
MRSA you know and if you've heard about in some of the hospitals they have this
very resistant microbe and MRSA and it's basically creating dissolving red blood
cells it's so so nasty do you realize that LDL helps to neutralize that and
someone goes on a statin a cholesterol-lowering drug that basically
inactivates cholesterol you're more susceptible to
this infection you're more susceptible to Marissa that's probably why a lot of
the people in the hospital which is they're on statin if they're getting
Marissa I mean it helps neutralize salmonella this might be something new
but to you but it's actually it's true so lvl takes care of microbes the
specific LDL that you want to test is LDL P and the reason for that is that
I'm not even concerned about LDL C which is stands for cholesterol but we want to
know the number of particles because that will indicate how much
triglycerides that are also in this LDL because it carries triglycerides which
are blood fats and cholesterol okay so when the doctor says though your bad
cholesterol is high we need to put your medication what they should say is why
is it high I mean it's there to try to heal something so let's talk about what
would increase LDL number one insulin resistance and in select pre-diabetes
diabetes that'll increase it hypothyroid infection do you realize that when
you're sick your cholesterol dl goes way up because your body is trying to heal
it right leaky gut because there's an immune reaction genetics there's there's
a genetic problem with this and so if you are tested which is rare if you are
tested with a genetic problem with high levels of cholesterol that's a whole
different video okay I'll do it on that later but and you need to keep it lower
because you can get out of control but I'm not talking about those people
stress will increase your LDL if you were to monitor your LDL on a hour to
hour basis it will fluctuate all over the place
so stress will increase it because of increased cortisol which increases
insulin and then surgery if you come out of surgery your LDL spiked up if you get
a tooth extraction your LDLs increase okay any type of trauma and visceral fat
that's the fat around your gut can increase this as well so instead of
trying to get rid of it ask the question why
it's their start to heal it and it will come down I just like it it's it's one
of the greatest ways to India just like a red flag to pull the string to see
what is causing that it's like now you know all the potential things you can
actually correct this and then it will come down but the last thing you want to
do is get on some drug to inactivate this healing cholesterol thanks for
watching I just want to take a moment to thank you for your amazing amazing
successes that you guys are writing about and I would love to have a
complete success rate from you with a before picture and an after picture as
well if you have that and I put a link down below so you can fill it out if you
don't have a weight loss before and after just put an image of yourself and
your success I would love to read it and I would love to share it with others

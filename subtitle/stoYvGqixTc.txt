now the top-selling drug in the world gives a really good clue on what we are
deficient in nutritionally so the question is what is
the top-selling drug in the world Humira
okay sells 19.9 billion dollars globally that was in
2018. so it could be more by now what does
this drug do it's an immunosuppressive drug okay
mainly it treats autoimmune diseases inflammatory conditions
rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis crohn's ankylosing spondylitis and
other types of conditions involving inflammation
one of the big problems that i see is the side effects because one of the side
effects is serious infections like tb infections
from viruses fungus bacteria it can also increase the
risk of certain types of cancer and the list goes on and on and
on now there's some very interesting information that i found on
this that i'm going to share with you but i'm not going to write on the board
i'm just going to tell you if you go to pubmed and just search
vaccine induced autoimmunity you will find
over 2000 entries there's a tremendous amount of research
in the connection between vaccinations and
autoimmune conditions what can someone do if someone's on this medication and
they wanted to get some relief more naturally well before i get into
that i just want to mention anything that i say is not meant to replace your
medical care check with your doctor before taking my
advice and be under your doctor's guidelines as
you follow this next three things that i'm going to
recommend okay three things very simple vitamin d
vitamin d is an immune suppressive
vitamin it's actually a hormone like vitamin substance or a compound
but it helps to suppress the immune system
but guess what it has slightly less side effects
than this drug right here you would want to take at least
40,000 IUs every single day you may see a lift in the inflammation
in your body okay also fasting fasting is one of the
cheapest ways to create an anti-inflammatory effect
the research on fasting and reducing inflammation is
incredible i'll put some links down below but combining
fasting with vitamin d with lowering your
carbs because too many carbs raise the inflammatory process in the body so
it's a combination of vitamin d fasting keto okay

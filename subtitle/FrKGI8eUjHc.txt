there are roughly about seven ways to
know if you are low in vitamin c okay
but i first want to cover some
confusions about vitamin c
the first one is between synthetic
vitamin c and natural vitamin c if you
look this up
you'll you'll be told that they're the
same there's no difference between
synthetic vitamin c
and natural vitamin c
chemically they're the exact identical
molecules
well these studies if you actually read
them
mainly talk about
absorption rate okay it's absorbed the
same well they might be the same but in
nature they're very very different in
fact ascorbic acid which is now called
vitamin c
really is just one little piece
of the vitamin c complex in nature you
never see just plain ascorbic acid but
when you see the studies that show
there's no difference between synthetic
versus natural
they're really only talking about
absorption rate okay they're not talking
about if vitamin c created an effect in
the body they're mainly talking about
well it absorbs at the same rate in the
same amount
but i want to know will it actually fix
my problem right well even the gentleman
who discovered vitamin c okay back i
think it was 1939
said that you can't cure scurvy okay
with isolated ascorbic
acid okay you can't cure scurvy scurvy
is a severe vitamin c
deficiency and i'm not saying that
there's no benefits from synthetic
vitamin c i just want to let you know
there's a huge difference between
synthetic
versus what you see in nature
that is part of the vitamin c
complex
and most of the synthetic vitamin c that
is sold out there is made by china and
they make it from sulfuric acid in corn
starch okay and you're going to tell me
that's the same thing as what they have
in nature well
i don't think so
in nature vitamin c comes as a complex
you have ascorbic acid as one part you
also have vitamin p which is the
bioflavonoids part
and
p stands for permeability because it's
related to vascular permeability and
this is why if you're deficient you tend
to have more bleeding because there's
more leaking through your capillaries
okay and then you also have vitamin k as
part of the vitamin c complex too so
that's included in a lot of functions
and the j factor has to do with
increasing oxygen in the lung and you
also have copper as a trace mineral
within the vitamin c complex in an
enzyme form called tyrosinase which is
involved in rebuilding
collagen okay in connective tissue so
this is why vitamin c is very very
important in
collagen formation connective tissue
joint health and a lot of vitamin c is
stored in the adrenal glands okay and
your white blood cells also need vitamin
c as part of the immune system
when you take vitamin c
the duration
of your cold can be a little bit less
but your immune system needs vitamin c
vitamin c is good for connective tissue
and also supporting the
walls of the capillaries to make sure
they don't leak vitamin c is a very
powerful antioxidant in one study which
i'm going to put down below they tested
in a lab okay so they took vitamin c and
they wanted to see if it was a really
good antioxidant and they found it
actually was a pro-oxidant okay in this
study well what does that mean well very
simply if you envision a free radical
okay which is
it's kind of an unpaired electron let's
say you took this little plate that's
spinning on my my finger and you had two
different weights on either side to
balance it out as it spins right
and then you took one of these these
weights off you can compare that to a
free radical because it's an unpaired
electron so we have uh something that's
not going to balance
and since this thing is spinning you can
have a lot of damage with this
unstable radical molecule an antioxidant
comes in and donates
that missing electron so now it can be
balanced and spin and be more stable but
if you're going to take uh ascorbic acid
okay or any synthetic antioxidant and
what's going to happen it's going to
donate its electron and then it itself
is going to be unpaired it becomes a
free radical in nature and in your body
you always have networks of antioxidants
so when one donates electron it can then
receive another electron from another
antioxidant and they can share their
electrons
in fact vitamin c helps to regenerate
vitamin e with this very same mechanism
because let's say for example you have a
lot of
problems in your arteries and vitamin e
is donating the electrons and you also
took vitamin c vitamin c can help
recharge the vitamin e so it can then
start donating more of these electrons
to help with this antioxidant effect
all right what are the ways that you can
determine if you're low in vitamin c
well number one the big one is bleeding
gums right if you brush your teeth and
it's these red little streaks on your
toothbrush and your bleeding and your
gums chances are you're low in vitamin c
number two you might have these small
little red and purple
dots on your skin
sometimes you see them in the lower leg
sometimes they can be anywhere on the
body okay
but this is an indication of low vitamin
c
another one number three is bruising now
remember i talked about this k1 right
here in the vitamin c complex well
vitamin k helps to prevent bleeding okay
so it's kind of coagulation so it's
going to help you
prevent
this excessive bleeding when you injure
yourself but if you have a vitamin c
deficiency without any injury
no
no reason for bruising and you get a
bruise you might want to look at a
vitamin c deficiency
next one is dry rough scaly skin okay
that can be a vitamin c
deficiency and as a side note the
chemical
structure vitamin c is very similar to
glucose okay and so if you're consuming
sugar at the same time you're consuming
vitamin c guess what's going to take
priority the glucose
this is why
kids adults who consume a lot of sugar
are usually always low in vitamin c also
if you're a smoker you're going to be
deficient in vitamin c because the need
for vitamin c goes way up
okay chicken skin like maybe in the back
of the arms you see these little little
uh bumps that you have okay and they're
slightly red or it could be on the legs
or your thighs
that could be a vitamin c deficiency it
could also be an omega-3 fatty acid
deficiency as well
nose bleeds are a symptom of low vitamin
c okay
and then we have dry splitting hair
which is another indication that you are
low in vitamin c now the best way to get
vitamin c is from food or food
concentrates from lemon or lemon juice
the problem with lemon juice is that
it's heated and heat destroys vitamin
c so if you're going to use lemon juice
to get your vitamin c make sure you get
it from actual lemons that you juice or
blend the whole lemon like i do in the
morning with a glass of water and a
teaspoon of my electrolyte powder it
tastes great but you can get vitamin c
from peppers any type of peppers green
peppers red peppers
vitamin c is in cabbage
vitamin c is in the berries
but the highest vitamin c is in
sauerkraut okay sauerkraut one cup of
sauerkraut could give you up to like 10
times the vitamin c that your body
requires each day now since vitamin c is
an interesting topic
you should probably watch my other video
i did on vitamin c
right here

you know i always get this question about grapefruit is it okay if i consume some
grapefruit thinking it's a lot different than an orange so i'm just going to create this short
video on this fruit grapefruit is high in vitamin c it has citric acid so it can actually decrease
the risk of kidney stones it has lycopene which is good for prostate problems but one thing about
grapefruit is that it has a certain chemical that inhibits an enzyme in your liver which blocks the
breakdown of medication and so the enzymes that normally metabolize the great majority
of drugs in your body so grapefruit inhibits that function causing a greatly elevated concentration
and accumulation of those drugs in fact if you take certain medications like statins
antidepressants high blood pressure medication and at the same time consume one grapefruit or a glass
of 7 ounces which comes out to a little over 200 grams you could potentially have a drug overdose
it can be very toxic but that's not the biggest reason that i would recommend not consuming
grapefruits the biggest reason is because it's loaded with sugar one cup which is 230 grams
of a grapefruit that's cut up in little slices gives you 25 grams of carbs or 16 grams of sugar
that is a lot of sugar now it's slightly less than an orange but still it's way way too high and i do
understand a lot of people love grapefruit but the problem is it's just too darn high in sugar

hey guys have a question what is worse than actual sugar if you have any ideas
they're just the combination of sugar and protein when you combine protein with sugar in the same
meal you spike insulin by 200% so that would be like in sweet pork barbecued ribs there's
so many in restaurant foods they always add the sugar to Chinese foods the hotdogs with the bun
hamburger with the bun the ketchup the drinks this is it sweet desserts TV dinners you'd ever want to
consume these two together if you consume these separately in two different meals it wouldn't
nearly be in so bad but combining sugar with protein is worse than consuming just sugar itself

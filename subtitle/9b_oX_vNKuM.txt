so when you're trying to solve stubborn weight you need a clue now being in practice for over 30
years i've run into some really tough cases where people have tried everything and nothing works so
there's a very important question that i always want to ask these people and here's the question
when exactly did you start gaining weight and what occurred just before that that always gives me a
really good clue on the potential causation and a potential solution now sometimes someone will tell
me uh well i've always been fat my entire life i said even when you were born yeah i was a fat baby
what about when you're one what about two oh actually when i was one i was thin
and then two i started gaining weight okay and then i'll ask them other questions about
what occurred right before that and sometimes they have to ask your parents but this is what i found
a lot of people gain weight after getting a tonsillectomy a lot of people gain weight
after being exposed to antibiotics at a very early age and there's studies on that that show
that relationship and other people gain weight after taking a steroid let's say for example
they have asthma or some type of skin reaction or skin allergy steroids antibiotics
surgery including tonsillectomy all can affect your metabolism now sometimes the person has
gained weight after a pregnancy or multiple pregnancies that would give you a clue that
there's a high level of estrogen in their body so they're estrogen dominant yet other people gain
weight after menopause which means that there's higher levels of cortisol because the adrenals
are the back up to the ovaries and yet other people gain weight after surgeries trauma major
losses accidents which severely increase cortisol which has devastating effects on your insulin
so if you personally have a real tough time losing weight you need to ask yourself these questions
and get some clues and then when you have that data then you can come up with a potential
solution let's say for example your estrogen dominant i have a whole program in helping
people balance out their estrogen i'll put that link down below let's say it came from
a trauma or some stress or surgery then we need to focus on the adrenals i put that link down below
let's say for example the person became a diabetic type one and then now they're on insulin or even a
type 2 and then they're on insulin i talk about that let's say for example your problem started
after taking antibiotics well there's all sorts of probiotics you can take to help re-establish
that microflora including certain healthy fibers that can actually feed the microbes that might be
some weakness that you need to work on over time to overcome this different way but regardless
of whatever type of stubborn problem you have the basics of getting on the healthy keto plan
and doing intermittent fasting usually will work but on a rare occasion some people need to
fast longer and i'm talking about not even doing one meal a day but doing one meal
every other day so some people need to go to that extreme before their metabolism starts coming
around so anyway i just wanted to bring up this very important question that you can use to try to
get a clue on why you're not losing weight hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

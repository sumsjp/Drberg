hey guys today we're going to talk about
how to fight cancer with
intermittent fasting cancer is very very
scary
and it's always better to try to prevent
it than to wait till you get it
and then try to backtrack cancer in
certain countries
is the number two cause of death okay so
the statistics aren't too good so the
odds are not in your favor
the chances of getting cancer are pretty
high i found this very interesting
article i put a link down below
the contribution of chemotherapy so when
you do chemotherapy
your five year survival in adults is
only
2.1 percent that's like insignificant
well radiation has a carcinogenic effect
it can trigger
more cancer and create mutations now
let's look at a normal cell and a cancer
cell and
the differences so in a normal cell you
have something called apoptosis
apoptosis is where the cell commits
suicide
okay so it has certain programs if the
cell is damaged
it kills itself and that protects you
because anytime you have an
alteration in genes it can create a bad
effect
so apoptosis is a really good thing to
keep the body in check
and preventing alterations in genetics
from
things that are carcinogenic okay
now with a cancer cell you lose this
apoptosis effect
cancer cells just don't die they keep
living and they take over in other words
if there's certain mutation or
alteration in the cell
your body is not able to clean that up
and get rid of that
so the cells just take over and they
start multiplying rapidly
what happens with cancer cells is you
first get a damage within the
mitochondria
okay through some type of trigger some
type of uh
carcinogen whether it's smoking
radiation
viruses chemicals poisons and the list
goes on and on
and then as a way of adapting to this
damage your mitochondria
alters its metabolism it starts to
shift to something called fermentation
okay it's a different
ancient metabolic pathway
and that's a key difference between a
normal cell
and a cancer cell it basically ferments
glucose okay so
cancer lives on glucose and it can live
on
glutamine which is an amino acid which
i'll get to in a second
if you do a pet scan to to look for
cancer what you're looking at is you're
looking for areas of your body that are
eating a lot of sugar so cancer cells
basically are sugar addicts
now it would make sense to say well i'm
just going to go on a ketogenic plan
that should be enough right i'll just
cut down my carbs
i'll be fine but what about this other
food for cancer cells glutamine
the problem with glutamine it's in
almost all foods
so it's really really hard to avoid okay
so yes ketogenic diet can help you with
cancer
but what about this well this is why
i recommend doing fasting or
intermittent fasting
some very interesting things happen when
you fast
you have this genetic shift okay
in certain genes that starts causing
this
protection effect and repair effect
so let me cover the things that can
happen when you fast
you get a decrease in oxidative damage
in other words
there's less free radical damage
occurring
when you fast your body can protect
against that
it can resist that type of stress you
also get more protection with the dna
and you have less dna damage and then
there are also enzymes
that help you detoxify the carcinogens
itself
there have been numerous studies to show
that fasting helps
shrink tumors okay and also improve
something called angiogenesis which is
basically
creating new blood vessels for the tumor
itself
fasting decreases inflammation and
what's unique about this
is that cancer cells seem to follow and
spread in areas
of inflammation like old injuries and
trauma so let's say for example you go
on chemotherapy okay and you do fasting
at the same time
fasting can help protect the healthy
cells
against the chemotherapy so you have
less nauseousness
less hair loss less digestive problems
like diarrhea
vomiting etc and the really cool thing
is you are actually
starving the cancer cell of both
glutamine to certain
certain degree when you're not eating
and glucose at the same time
okay because it's only the normal cells
that can live on ketones
not the cancer cells so why wouldn't
someone with cancer
or that wants to prevent cancer not do
fasting
and the ketogenic diet it's i have no
idea and one last thing i interviewed dr
seyfried which you've got to check out
this interview this guy
is an excellent researcher that's been
researching cancer
for decades and one thing he mentions
that if you even do a yearly fast
of seven days you can greatly reduce
your risk of cancer
i recommend doing periodic prolonged
fasting
and regular intermittent fasting okay
and i'll put some links down below for
that
so whether you want to prevent cancer or
you have cancer and you want to do
something about it
uh definitely start doing this
immediately thanks for watching
hey guys real quick i have a new healthy
keto eating plan for you
just go to dr berg.com it's right on the
front page i put a link down below
download it it's free check it out

let's talk about the benefits of gotu kola now this natural remedy has been around for a very
long time thousands of years it's very popular in indonesia and other countries as well it's known
as the student herb because a lot of students use it to sharpen their mind improve their cognition
their memory their ability to learn their brain function and brain circulation now there's quite
a few studies on the brain itself which i'll put some links down below that show positive effects
for neural dendrites okay so neural dendrite is kind of like a the branches on a tree
and all these neurons extend out and they connect with other neurons in their communication pathways
and then gotu kola can actually help reverse damage in those neuron interactions all right
number two there's a lot of cognitive benefits okay because it can increase your memory
learning like i said also increase acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter can increase attention
as well as motivation and number three it has some neuroprotective properties so it protects the
brain from oxidation toxins heavy metals things like that now gotu kola also is known as the
longevity herb because it can increase telomerase activity by more than eight times now what is
telomerase activity telomerase is an enzyme that keeps adding dna to a telomere all right
well what's a telomere it's this right here you see this little plastic at the end of a shoelace
that's what a telomere is a telomere is at the end of your chromosomes and it protects these genes
from being damaged and so the shorter the telomere the more risk you are for getting
all sorts of diseases and the shorter your life is so a telomere maintains the gene stability
and it decreases the risk of age-related diseases now there's a lot of other things that
can increase telomeres i will be doing a video on that shortly but i wanted to create uh this one on
a very specific product that's pretty awesome hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

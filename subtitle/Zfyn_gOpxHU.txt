I want to discuss the relationship between your friendly bacteria your gut
bacteria we're gonna call that the microbiome and your immune system in
fact 70% of your immune system really is this microbiome your gut bacteria you
have trillions and trillions of microbes living in and around your body that are
a constantly exchanging with you you're giving them a place to live and what
they give you is immune protection they give you nutrients they help your blood
sugars and they give you other things that are beneficial there's over 10,000
different species of friendly bacteria in and around your body and 99% of them
are non pathogenic they're the good guys the great majority of microbes in your
body are living in the large colon just above and in the mucus layer and then
you have the colon cells and then you have another layer of protection where
you have certain immune cells or guards waiting for an invader to pop through so
they can attack and eat them up what happens is when you have an imbalance in
the microbiome you start to lose your gut lymphatic layer you start to have a
decrease in your lymph nodes you start to have less antibodies and antibodies
are those things that attach on microbes they don't kill the microbes
they put a tag on them for other immune cells to kill them antibodies are very
specific to different pathogens and then you also have a decrease in the T cell
production and T stands for thymus because the thymus gland helps train the
T cells and you're gonna have less of that the primary function of the thymus
gland is central tolerance able to tolerate your own cells that are
beneficial to you because if you do not have that function these soldier cells
they're like special forces would not be able to tell the difference between the
good guys and the bad guys and they would end up killing both of them and
you end up with your own body cells getting
attacked that is a condition cold and autoimmune disease Auto antibodies or
antibodies that are basically attacking your own tissue but they're not really
attacking they're tagging your own tissue as being a bad guy and other
immune cells like t-cells are going in there and actually trying to attack them
and that creates inflammation and when you have autoimmune conditions you
always have inflammation and that's really what's happening you're getting
this constant attack and because the microbiome is so heavily connected to
your immune system when you lose this you lose this and you lose the tolerance
and you lose the ability to learn to differentiate now we have a situation
where we have a lot of friendly fire and we have a lot of collateral damage in
the body and a lot of inflammation t-cells not only differentiate between
your cells and a pathogen cell it's quite amazing that your body has this
ability to differentiate trillions of cells from pathogens that are not
necessarily your cell but they're so intimately involved and there's such a
helper to your body that your body has developed a system to keep them alive
and not attack and kill them and also there are certain t-cells that suppress
inflammation so if we lose that what do we get a lot of inflammatory conditions
if we also don't have enough microbiome we get less small chain fatty acid and
one would be called butyrate and butyrate is not only helpful in
balancing your blood sugars and definitely improving insulin resistance
but it's also there to help improve your immune system also you have less ability
to make b12 B1 vitamin K biotin and even lactic acid which makes the
environment for pathogens very uncomfortable also the microbiome are
hoarding the food and the space to also limit the amount of pathogenic bacteria
to exist and the less microbiome you have the weaker the intestinal barrier
and then you start getting leaky gut and I
really think and this is my own opinion that autoimmune disease starts in the
gut if you ever talked to someone who has an
autoimmune disease I'm talking about like Hashimoto's
Crohn's lupus MS they almost always have a gut problem and my other videos when I
talk about COVID-19 the coronavirus the way that that virus attacks your cell is
through a receptor called the ACE2 receptor well it just so happens that
your gut has way more ace2 receptors than the lung tissue so this is another
mode of entry into the cell that goes beyond just your lung infection which is
quite interesting if you want to know what to do to support the microbiome

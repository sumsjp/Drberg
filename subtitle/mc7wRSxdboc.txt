let's talk about the first symptom of a magnesium deficiency and that is you don't
have the endurance when you start exercising in other words you tire more easily when you
exercise that's the first symptom there are many more as well like your memory starts going you
start getting blood pressure issues your risk for getting soft tissue calcification can occur
with a magnesium deficiency your sleep won't be that great you might be a little more irritable
arrhythmias due to the electrolytes that are needed to keep the heart in rhythm
cramping in the feet or the calf you can also have tetany which is a little twitching here
or even a tremor tremors could be a magnesium deficiency there's over 300
enzymes that are dependent on magnesium 65 of patients in intensive care are
severely magnesium deficient over half of the population does not consume enough magnesium
in their diet also if you have a subclinical magnesium deficiency and you start fasting
and you start feeling fatigue you just need the electrolytes this is why i always recommend
electrolytes if you're doing fasting eighty percent of all alcoholics have a magnesium
deficiency now let's talk about what would cause a magnesium deficiency number one
you're not eating enough your diet number two you're eating the wrong foods refined foods
cause the deficiency of magnesium more stress the more deficiency you're going to have if you're
low in vitamin d because vitamin d stimulates the absorption of magnesium plus it goes the other way
around too you need magnesium to absorb vitamin d i'll do a separate video on that alcohol depletes
magnesium having diabetes will cause a magnesium deficiency diuretics can create
a deficiency diarrhea antacids antibiotics and malabsorption all create a magnesium deficiency
but i believe the number one cause is insulin resistance because you need that insulin receptor
to absorb magnesium and it's it's resisting phytates let's say for example you consume
beans legumes and grains they have phytates that will block the absorption of magnesium now
chlorophyll is the blood of the plant it's green at the heart of chlorophyll is magnesium
chemistry of chlorophyll is similar to blood but blood has iron and that's why it's red
and this is why leafy greens are i think important to consume in your diet at least
six seven cups per day all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question

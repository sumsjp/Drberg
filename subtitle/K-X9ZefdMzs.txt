hi guys in this video I want to talk about the importance of vitamin A in pregnancy if you're
going to get pregnant well you know someone a family member that's going to be pregnant send
this video okay now I don't know how long ago but there was a change in the RDA the
recommended amount of vitamin A in a prenatal and that now it's 8,000 okay I use but there's
a study I'm going to put a link down below that talks about the importance of having at least
twenty to twenty-five thousand I use to prevent birth defects now there's three forms of vitamin
A active forms of vitamin A retinol retinol and retinyl acid there's if you actually have to see
a prenatal you'll see usually something called beta carotene that is a precursor to the active
form and only a small amount of it is converted okay and the reason why they made this change to
make it eight thousand which is way too low is because there's been a lot of toxic effects of vitamin A
simply because they were using a synthetic vitamin A okay you never want to take synthetic vitamin
A because it's toxic they weren't using a natural one so they decided instead of putting the natural
they decided to put you the lower dosages of synthetic or do the precursor beta-carotene okay
so that's what happened so here is some of the birth defects that can occur kidney malformation
dysfunctional ureter is where you're urinating and the urine backs up through the kidney popular
problems around the the ureters cleft lip cleft palate where you have that little non-union of the
lip or the bone right on top of the lip their eye defects your brain becomes a condition where the
brain becomes located outside the skull that's pretty bad short or long mandible that's the
overbite and underbite how many kids have dental arch problems where their bite is not correct
that could be a vitamin A deficiency so simple to correct by just making sure the mother actually
has a vitamin A so there's two good sources that I would recommend one would be cod liver oil make
sure you get the virgin cod liver oil that's the top of the line it's expensive but it's
worth it or grass-fed liver okay you can get it in tablets or basically just you know eat
them at least once a week and that will give you the natural form of vitamin A because out of all
three of these forms retinoic acid is the most important form to in development of the embryo
that's why you need the vitamin A to be able to provide that raw material all right thanks for

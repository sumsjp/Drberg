I want to talk about styes okay a stye is a fluid-filled puss little sack on the inside of the
eyelid that's very irritating they're very common but a lot of times people don't really know what
to do with them okay and this could also relate to boils you have underneath your armpit your
back and back of the knee it's the same thing one of the common causes it's a bacterial infection
sometimes viral okay but what happens is that your immune system the white blood cell the most
common white blood cell is the neutrophil and that's like your primary defense against these
infections so the neutrophil goes in there and it's like a little pac-man starts eating
up all the bacteria the problem is is if you have consumed too much sugar okay or you're a diabetic
or you're pre-diabetic you have hypoglycemic instant resistance whatever what will happen
the neutrophil will nearly always go after the sugar and ignore the infection okay that's what
happens because and then they just love sugar okay so they'll go after that and they stop working so
sugar in activates that whole thing so you might find that the worst thing to do when you get one
of these things is take some syrup be like like medicine like with glucose or drink juice or eat
eat or drink anything sweet is not a good idea so what you need to do is cut out all sugars of
all kind that includes the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes and trying to
snack too much you want to keep the sugar way way down and you're going to get over these things a
lot faster if you do that okay so go ahead and try this and leave your comments below

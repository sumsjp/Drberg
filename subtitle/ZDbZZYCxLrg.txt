i had another question from someone that wanted to know can i add honey
to apple cider vinegar some people add lemons some people don't
but the honey part is what we're going to focus on here's the problem with
honey 56 of it is fructose and 44
of it is glucose now these numbers aren't exact there's some other sugars
in there as well uh it has a glycemic index of 78.
it's high now glucose has a glycemic index of 100
now you might have this idea that eating pure glucose is going to be
really really bad and if we add some fructose in there which actually will
lower the glycemic index it's going to be a lot better
the problem with fructose is that it's not dealt with by all your cells in
your body only the cells in the liver can deal
with fructose so it puts a lot of stress in the liver and it creates a lot of
problems now honey compared to sugar is obviously
a little bit better if you had the choice you know of course
honey is a little bit better because it has some antioxidants so it's
good for various things wound healing it has some
antimicrobial properties it may help you with certain allergies
but overall it's low in actual nutrients and it's a little bit better
than refined sugar but not much so that's the long answer
to the question but the short answer is no thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

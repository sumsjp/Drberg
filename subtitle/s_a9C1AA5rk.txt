let's talk about the dangers and benefits of erythritol now what is
erythritol it's a sugar alcohol it has nothing to do with alcohol you're not
gonna get drunk by consuming erythritol basically it's an alternative
sweetener and it's 60 to 70 percent as sweet as sugar so it's not exactly as
sweet as sugar it's a little less and it does have a kind of a cooling effect
when you consume it as far as the calories go it has less than 25% of one
calorie per gram like sugar has four calories per gram protein has four
calories per gram fat has nine calories per gram
erythritol has .24 calories so it's barely 1/4 of one calorie per
gram very insignificant so in a thumbnail sketch it's 95 percent less
calories than sugar it gets absorbed in the small intestine
okay it gets in the blood but it gets excreted by the kidney unchanged so the
microbes don't like to eat it so you really don't have many negative effects
with erythritol it has zero effect on insulin it's zero on the glycemic
index it does not affect your blood sugars so even though it's made from
sugar using a certain friendly yeast to extract this sugar alcohol as long as
it's non-gmo I think it's a really good alternative sweetener what are the
dangers at high doses greater than 50 grams which I don't know anyone
consuming that much in one sitting you may get some gas bloating stomach
noise and it may have a laxative effect but other than that there's actually
virtually no additional dangerous side effects alright thanks for watching and

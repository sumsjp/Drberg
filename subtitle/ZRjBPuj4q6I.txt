so today I want to touch on a very important topic vitamin D you know how
important vitamin D is for the immune system you know how important it is for
keeping calcium in the bone you also know how important it is to decrease
inflammation but it's an immune modulator so in other words it can
control the immune system and a lot of people are taking a good amount of it
every day and that's very very good however you need to be aware of this one
fact okay if you do large amounts of vitamin D over a period of time without
enough magnesium in your diet let's say your magnesium deficient because you
don't consume any vegetables and you don't take any magnesium what happens is
higher doses of vitamin D intensifies magnesium deficiencies magnesium works
with vitamin D they work together they share the same enzymes so as you
increase vitamin D you could potentially decrease magnesium magnesium has a very
very important function of keeping calcium from accumulating inside the
cells inside the kidney and the arteries in the joints so it's very similar to
vitamin k2 and the vitamin k2 helps keep calcium from building up in the soft
tissues the magnesium also does that as well so when you're taking large amounts
of d3 okay without the magnesium you could end up with potentially kidney
stones or calcium buildup in the artery or calcium in the joints where it should
not be magnesium is really necessary also to activate vitamin D so they work
together so if you're consuming a good amount of vegetables every day you have
nothing to worry about or if you're taking a good magnesium supplement you
don't have to worry about it this is just for the people that are not taking
magnesium or not consuming vegetables and all of a sudden you end up with a
health problem because you didn't connect the dots and also vitamin
B6 is very very important in this mechanism as well because it too is a
cofactor and it helps these to work so if your diet is fairly healthy you don't
really have to worry about this but if you're doing let's say unhealthy foods
or you're doing dirty keto now and you're not somehow getting enough b6 that could
be another problem as well b6 works together with these two
nutrients I think the biggest danger is if you're not taking enough magnesium
and you're a stone former and you take a lot of vitamin D because you have low
back pain or something like that over a long period of time you could increase
your risk of kidney stones I'm just bringing this point up if you're in this
situation so you can actually supply your body with enough magnesium if
you're consuming at least 7 cups of vegetables a day you have nothing to
worry about that's gonna be enough magnesium most of the magnesium is in
leafy greens it's in some nuts but it's the at the center of chlorophyll and
that's the green of the plant if you've been watching my videos and applying my
information which I'm sure you are 100% of the time you have nothing to worry
about and if you haven't seen my video on
magnesium I put it right here check it out

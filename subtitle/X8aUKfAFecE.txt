this video is on what foods to avoid if you're pregnant and i'm going to be creating
quite a few other videos on pregnancy because it's the absolute most important time to get your diet
extremely healthy and to avoid certain things but let's let's focus what to avoid if you're pregnant
number one high mercury fish okay that would be avoiding shark swordfish king mackerel
marlin tilefish orange roughy certain types of tuna which should be albacore yellowfin
and big eye because all of these have too much mercury and when you're pregnant you simply do
not want a lot of mercury in your body because it can affect this growing baby and also create
certain nutrition deficiencies and create problems in development in this delicate phase all right so
then the question is what fish is okay well salmon fish eggs cod flounder haddock tilapia trout and
make sure that they're all while caught there's so many other beneficial things in fish for pregnant
women just minus the mercury all right number two raw fish now if you can find a good source of raw
fish that you know is not contaminated with any type of bacteria like salmonella that might be
a good thing but if you're you're your local sushi restaurant it could be contaminated with
salmonella and that can definitely affect uh your babies and so you just want to make sure that the
if you're going to do raw fish it has to be high quality maybe if you bought some raw fish and you
froze it for 72 hours to kill everything and then you made your own sushi that might be a good idea
but typically i would be careful of raw fish now number three raw sprouts now i'm not talking about
the raw sprouts that you're going to make at home or maybe raw sprouts that you're going to
get at the health store i'm talking about the raw sprouts that you would get at the
open salad buffet at your local grocery store or some other restaurant that the quality might not
be that great why because there's a higher risk of getting salmonella when you consume
raw sprouts that are not of the quality that you would normally want all right number four
involves the conventional hot dogs lunch meats and deli meats that you would get at your local
grocery store if you're going to do hot dogs lunch meat deli meat make sure that it's organic
it's from grass-fed animals and it doesn't have any added sugar make sure the quality is there and
these animals are usually grain fed so that means they have higher amounts of omega-6 fatty acids
they're more inflammatory so just go quality if you're going to do hot dogs lunch meat and deli
meats number five this is the most important thing i know when women get pregnant they have certain
cravings and they pretty much consume anything they want like ice cream refined carbohydrates
sugar you have to realize that this is going to set you up for insulin resistance maybe even
pre-diabetes and even gestational diabetes not to mention depleting a lot of vitamins and minerals
and so if you have a growing baby inside you you want to keep your carbs low simply because that
baby is getting everything that you're consuming and you could potentially set that baby up for a
pre-diabetic state as they get older now if you're new to my channel and you don't know much about
keto and intermittent fasting i put a link down below i definitely want to do the healthy version
of keto if you're pregnant but not intermittent fasting okay all right and number six you want to
avoid rice in grains why because they're high in phytic acid which will also deplete zinc and other
minerals now i have several other videos on pregnancy that you should also check out
i put those links down below check them out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

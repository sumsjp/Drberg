let's talk about the two underlying reasons for gerd
okay first one is a vitamin d deficiency if you haven't seen my other video on
how vitamin d influences muscles i put a link down below
but it does typically people have this idea that
vitamin d controls calcium and affects the immune system
but it does a lot more including controlling muscle
function to a very large degree and when we deal with the stomach
we're dealing with smooth muscles both in
the sphincters the top one and the bottom one
as well as the muscle itself which is smooth muscle
vitamin d increases calcium absorption so it's all about contractibility so if
you're lacking vitamin d you can get incomplete closure
of this valve right here so gerd stands for
gastroenter reflux disorder so the acid in the stomach
is coming going right up to this valve into the esophagus
and it can damage the cells of esophagus create inflammation and even increase
the risk of cancer vitamin d deficiency is one cause
and you have vitamin d receptors in the esophagus in the stomach
in these valves so you have a lot of locations where vitamin d is involved
the second underlying reason why someone might have gerd
is they have lower amounts of hydrochloric acid
in the stomach itself which is very common as we age
we decrease the production of hcl if you're on an antacid that can also
decrease the stomach acid and as soon as you come off that medication
now you really can't digest because it just depleted
most of your stomach acid but what happens when you don't have enough
hydrochloric acid in the stomach is you get incomplete closure of this
valve there's a little sensor a ph sensor in
this valve which makes a lot of sense because when
you eat food you want to have food go through here
and have it being digested and have this completely closed
off right you don't want acid backing up so if there's just not enough acid to
trigger this the sensor in this valve then what
happens the acid splashes up now the other thing that's happening is
if you don't have enough hydrochloric acid
you're going to get incomplete digestion especially a protein
and the biggest symptom is gas so we start building up
gas bubbles right here and it's going to pop this open right here
just from the gas in this situation you would take about
30,000 IUs of vitamin d3 per day in this situation you would want
to take something called betaine hydrochloride
as well as apple cider vinegar the combination actually works very very
well so i put a link down below for more
information about hydrochloric acid thanks for watching before you go if you
have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the u.s
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

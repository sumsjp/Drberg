let's talk about the five herbal remedies for the coronavirus now this
data is based on the research that was done on a previous coronavirus there is
some interesting data on this current virus COVID-19 which I'm gonna include
down below and check it out but I think it's really important to know about this
simply because these herbs really are targeted to your lungs and the
coronaviruses tend to attack the lung out of all the tissues now a lot of this
research was done in China using traditional Chinese herbs and it was
taken from one of the oldest textbooks in China called the treatise on cold
damaged disease written in 220 AD so I'm just gonna mention five of the herbs
some of the herbs you can't get in the U.S. like Mei hung and there's a couple
others so number one there's a chemical called glycyrrhizin from black licorice
which appears to be a very powerful inhibitor for SARS and related
coronaviruses and the study that I got this data from which I put a link down
below was actually in a very highly credible paper and Lancet and it
revealed very positive outcomes on the respiratory system generating healthy
mucus and there is also some interesting data on how it can hit the hepatitis C
virus and even HIV but this phytonutrient in black licorice can
increase the t-cells it has antiviral properties and it has the ability to
decrease the penetration of that virus inside the cell in vitro which means
tests that were done outside the body the next promising herb is the mayberry
leaf and then we get skullcap baicalin which is one of the main chemicals in
skullcap has shown to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 benefits and i'll put that link
down below and it does it by inhibiting the receptor that that virus uses to
enter this cell and just as a disclaimer I'm not telling you any of these herbs
are going to cure any viruses at all this is primarily just for educational
purposes so you can do your own research now if you haven't seen my video on how
to boost the immune system I put it right here check it out

hi guys dr berg here again listen i want
to talk about the
absolute worst advice you could ever
give a diabetic okay ready for it
five small meals a day okay that's the
worst advice in fact i used to give this
advice before i knew better because i
was taught this way in school but
it is bad advice so let's talk about why
this is it has to do with
what most people are missing
in their database of knowledge about
diabetes
they might know that carbs will increase
insulin but a lot of times they do not
know that eating in general regardless
of what you eat will trigger insulin
doesn't matter what you eat every time
you eat or a snack you spike insulin
now what is
a diabetic a diabetic is someone with
too much insulin now yes if you're type
1 diabetic which you're completely burnt
out you don't have any insulin
i'm talking about the vast majority of
people who are diabetic type 2
and
they have too much insulin okay
and so that's
so what happens is they're insulin
resistance so they have to take
metformin and other
types of medications to make the insulin
connect more but if you check their
fasting insulin level it's always really
really really high
okay
now
look at this meal one two three four
five you spike insulin you spike you
spike insulin it's gonna create way too
much insulin
you're never gonna ever fix diabetes
you're gonna become a diabetic worse and
worse if you keep doing this
so here what do you do you basically we
know to cut we need to cut down
the frequency of meals this is not like
starving the person this is not
even cutting calories for cutting
calories we want to decrease
the meals
why
so we have more time in between the
meals
to keep insulin low
when you don't eat insulin goes lower
and you could heal insulin what you want
to work up to if you're a pre-diabetic
or diabetic is two meals a day
ideally it's going to take a while to do
that
but it's the ideal scene if you want to
improve your blood sugars
okay
so up to two males and then you have
more time to heal now how do you do this
how could you actually eat less and not
be so darn hungry all the time
well
you add a little more fat healthy fat to
the meal
okay
and that allows you to go longer without
being starving i'm not talking about
low-fat protein and vegetables that you
have to add the fat in there to go
longer i'll put some links down below
but the other thing is that if you eat
these small meals
you're spiking insulin insulin comes in
there lowers blood sugar okay guess what
you're going to be hungry
you're going to spike insulin again for
the next meal it's going to lower blood
sugar guess what you're going to crave
crave carbs
same thing happens over and over and
over
so if you can actually go longer keep
insulin low you can heal a lot of issues
especially
maybe even not even become not even be a
diabetic anymore
okay so i put some links down below but
this is the absolute worst advice for
diabetics so if you know a diabetic have
watched this video and just
apply this for a month and prove it to
yourself you'll be quite amazed with the
results

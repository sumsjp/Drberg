i'm going to talk about how to use mct oil what is mct oil it's a type of fat that is very unique
in that it can fairly quickly turn into ketones through the liver and it doesn't depend on the
gallbladder or enzymes or a good part of your digestive system it goes right into the small
intestine it gets absorbed into the lymphatics it goes right to the liver it's converted into
ketones so it's actually more efficient and it can really help you fast longer it can give
your brain more energy as well as your heart and it also allows you to have energy while you're
exercising you have to be careful though in the very beginning because if you take too much you
may feel nauseous you may feel abdominal cramping or you might have diarrhea because it can act as a
laxative so i always recommend starting out with one teaspoon per day go really slow and maybe
every few days add a little bit more a little bit more until you're eventually at one tablespoon
and then eventually two tablespoons now some people go more than that up to four tablespoons
um you wouldn't want to start out like that but the reason why they want to do that
is let's say for example they're very thin and they're trying to maintain their weight and their
metabolism is very very fast they need to add more fat because your body is going to be burning this
mct oil as fuel and it's going to burn this fuel before it goes after your own fat so it's one way
to keep your weight up so what are some ways that you can include mct oil in the diet well you can
just add it to the diet while you're fasting for the purpose of fasting longer especially in the
beginning in the beginning it's hard to go from one meal to the next for any period of time so
if you can add some mct oil there it will be very very satisfying because your body will use that as
energy and it's a good transition step number two a lot of people added in the coffee or their tea
if you're gonna do the coffee in the morning you're gonna find that it's gonna be a lot easier
to avoid breakfast when you're actually starting this plan when you're doing intermittent fasting
also it's going to give you a lot more brain energy and focus and cognitive function
so you're going to find that you'll have more mental focus and cognitive skills when you do that
number three taking it 30 minutes before you work out why because it takes about 20 to 30 minutes
for it to kick in the turn in the ketones and if you have more ketones your body will use that in
place of glucose and it's going to give you more energy and endurance while you're working out
number four put in your salad dressing okay it's a real simple thing to do you'll never even taste it
because you're going to use other things as well now realize that putting salad dressing with
salad is always a good thing because there are certain fat soluble phytonutrients that have huge
benefits in leafy greens and different types of vegetables so if you're going to add this oil in
there you're going to increase the absorption of those fat soluble compounds because you're adding
an oil you can put in your guacamole to give you a little advantage of having more ketones
you can also put in your nut butters so you could take celery and scoop it and get a combination of
you know some type of nut butter with your mct oil number seven you can make various keto fat bombs i
have a lot of recipes on that i'll put a link down below and that's a way to enhance the fat bomb
to add some mct oil to nut butters all right number eight cook with it but make sure you don't
go over 320 degrees fahrenheit but if you're going to saute something you can cook with it
number nine you can take it while you take certain fat soluble vitamins like vitamin a vitamin d
vitamin e vitamin k which need some fat to be absorbed so that's a real simple thing
to do to enhance the absorption all right guys there you have it there's nine ways to use mct oil

let's talk about the consequences of high estrogen in men number one it
increases your risk of a stroke why because excess estrogen increases
your risk of getting blood clots now estrogen specifically estradiol
typically is at higher levels when someone has a heart attack and when men
have atherosclerosis so too much estrogen is very dangerous to your
cardiovascular system also when you have estrogen dominance your prostate could
start to enlarge so estrogen is an anabolic hormone it grows things so the
next question is why are men becoming estrogen dominant well it could be the
soy products they are consuming because soy potentially can increase estrogen
and I'm not talking about the organic tofu or the organic miso soup or
organic fermented soy products like natto I'm not talking about those I'm
talking about conventional soy oil soy protein isolates and the soy products
that you would see in a lot of the vegetarian foods now it also could come
from something called endocrine disruptors so there are these things in
the environment like pesticides insecticides herbicides and fungicides
that have the effect of mimicking estrogen so endocrine disruptors are
also called estrogen disruptors so the more that you have in the body the more
estrogen effects you're going to have in the body now also if you're consuming a
lot of commercial dairy this could potentially increase your estrogen
levels now while these definitely will increase estrogen there's something that
creates a bigger effect in your body and that would be this the conversion of
testosterone to estrogen by this one enzyme called aromatase if you have too
much of this enzyme that could be your number one source of estrogen because
it's just converting your testosterone to estrogen so as your testosterone goes
down you lose your get-up-and-go you lose your lean body mass and you start
getting breast tissue enlarged prostate and increasing your
risk for all sorts of other problems so now the question is where is this enzyme
coming from well can you take a well guess your belly fat having more fat in
the midsection increases this enzyme so what do you do you could take an
aromatase inhibitor to stop this process okay and there's some natural ones like
DIM which is a concentrated form of cruciferous vegetables so that would be
the other thing cruciferous vegetables typically are a natural source for aromatase
inhibitors like kale broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage cauliflower also
stinging nettle root is a natural herb that is an aromatase inhibitor it's also
really good for inflammation but the other thing you need to do to get rid of
this is simply reduce your overall insulin insulin is causing this right
here now how do you do that if you're new to my channel what you
need to do is you need to do something called the ketogenic diet and intermittent
fasting and I put the most important video right here to get
started check it out

hey guys in this video we're gonna talk about how to fix a chronic cough you know like you're you're
constantly clearing your throat and it's driving you crazy or your spouse is going crazy because
she's listening to you the most common deficiency is the calcium deficiency okay because the larynx
when it's missing calcium tends to create a tension in an irritation and this is the most
common deficiency so the best source of calcium for this problem would be calcium lactate calcium
lactate absorbs in the body really really fast compared to other types of calcium like calcium
carbonate which is limestone rocks that's not the one that you want to use you want to use
the lactate version and also this works really good for canker sores or for your blisters and
I keep it around the house well I don't have any you know my kids aren't small anymore but
when they were small if you if the child has a fever and you give them calcium lactate it
just it really brings it down or if they can't sleep calcium lactate before a bed just just
helps them sleep or if the infant is like you're breastfeeding and the infant is just not sleeping
through the night calcium lactate it'll help that you wanted to consume it the mother wants to take
herself and then it comes to the breast milk and then BAM if you're doing a bottle then go ahead
and crush it up a little powder and then put it in the milk and that really really works okay
for infants and small children and yes it could come you can have this chronic cough from acid
reflux it's not as common and then if it is at the reflux I put a link down below but adrenal
fatigue can do it also a b12 deficiency these are just other things to look at if this doesn't work
but this is the most inexpensive remedy it's like maybe two dollars for a whole bottle of
sixty and it's it's an inexpensive solution to a chronic problem thanks for watching

i had a question from youtube they wanted to know how do you get rid of sun spots i've done another
video on aging spots or liver spots and i'll put that link down below and that talks mainly about
the hyper pigmentation that occurs if there is three situations high insulin high estrogen
or high cortisol from stress but i didn't actually do a video on the best remedy for
sun spots which is slightly different now these little tiny cells in the skin called melanocytes
produce this pigment called melanin which gives you the color of your skin and if you're exposed
to the sun too much you can develop these little blemishes or dark spots to your skin now there's
a really good remedy for this that you can use and it's basically licorice extract and you want
to get it in a tincture a liquid and you want to make sure it's alcohol free and you want to
put it in a little spoon and put a couple drops in there and mix it up and then apply it to your skin
you can also apply it underneath your eyes if you have dark circles and it works pretty effectively
within a couple days licorice root does many things it's a very powerful antioxidant it's an
anti-inflammatory it's used for stress digestive problems and many other things but if you wanted
to get rid of your sunspots you might want to try this because it's pretty darn effective

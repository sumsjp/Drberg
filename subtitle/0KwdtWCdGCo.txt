let's talk about the symptoms of sleep deprivation the person who took the world record
for sustained um i guess lack of sleep or sleep deprivation was 11 days man that's a long time
um if i didn't sleep for more than one day i would probably have some serious side effects
from that um i remember in basic training they kept us up for 48 hours that was rough
um and then in my 20s i there was quite a few years where i didn't sleep there there were
nights that i didn't sleep even one minute so it's it's literally torture not being able to sleep
the benefits of sleep are detoxification which i'm going to do another video on and an overall
rejuvenation of a lot of body chemicals that's this is when you heal all right so number one
the symptoms of sleep deprivation cognitive impairments so this is loss of concentration
memory and focus you're going to get brain fog number two irritability or anxiety
or depression number three high blood glucose so it can negatively affect your blood sugars
number four a lowered immune system not sleeping can increase your susceptibility to getting sick
number five inflammation six seven and eight delusion paranoia and psychosis can occur
from a chronic sleep deprivation situation so you literally can go insane by not sleeping
number nine damage to your gut there's been two interesting studies that i just read one relating
to fruit flies free flies will last about 11 days and then they die if you deprive them of sleep
so if you have any fruit flies around it says pets make sure that they get regular consistent
high quality sleep they also did the study on mice and they found a lot of inflammation
in the gut and the small intestine as well as the large apparently there was a massive increase in
ross which is a type of oxidation and the reason for that probably has to do with melatonin because
you have 400 times the amount the concentration of melatonin in your gut than in your brain
and melatonin is a very powerful antioxidant go figure they found also when they added some
antioxidants to the diet of the fruit flies they did live a little longer but the key is sleep now
i get probably about six hours of sleep i can go up for like 10 minutes and pop back up and
feel totally refreshed but typically most people need between seven and nine hours of sleep to
feel refreshed some people can get by on a lot less anyway put your comments down below of how
many hours of sleep you get hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

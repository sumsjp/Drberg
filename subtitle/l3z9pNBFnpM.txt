hey it's me again in this video we're going to talk about the amazing gallbladder
part 4 okay so this is the last video in the series and there's a couple
more things I want to share with you number one the gallbladder releases
bile that helps break down fat but it doesn't break down fat all the way to
the smallest particle it needs help by this thing called the pancreas the
pancreas and the gallbladder work together to break down these fats so if
you are substituting bile into the diet or a purified bile salt and it doesn't
fully solve the problem it could mean that the pancreas is not releasing
enzymes because the symptoms of pancreatic enzyme deficiencies are very
similar to a gallbladder deficiency or a bile deficiency okay so you have to kind
of understand that there could be that too because they both work together so
this pancreas makes a fat enzyme called lipase and that really works to help
take that break down of fat all the way down to the smallest particle so you can
start absorbing it and start using it so that's very important now also there's
some studies that show that having enough bile will prevent fibrosis now
what is fibrosis that's the scar tissue that builds up on
the liver fibrosis of the soft tissues it's like scar tissue it's like
a connective tissue that just kind of plugs everything up so I just want to
point that out because if you have fibrosis one of the things that I found
when I'm doing research if you take purified bile salts that can improve that
condition so you might want to do research in that area
next thing we're talking about is cholesterol now people are freaked out
because of cholesterol but they don't understand what cholesterol is they
think cholesterol is a fat cholesterol is not a fat you've heard of HDL and LDL
do you know what it stands for high density lipoproteins low-density
lipoproteins they're proteins that carry fat through the body and they the
purpose of that cholesterol is to actually help heal parts of the body so
if there's some type of inflammation in your arteries
it's called the lesion that cholesterol will come in there and start healing up
like a band-aid and if you don't understand that you're going to think that oh my
gosh my cholesterol is too high I'm going to get clogged arteries when
really it's just trying to heal your arteries because you've eaten too much
sugar or junk food so cholesterol is not a bad thing it's likely it just tells
you that the body is trying to heal itself in some way and to have someone
tell you you need extremely low cholesterol like down to the hundreds
like way down low like a hundred or below 100 I wholly disagree with that
because there's just as many problems health-wise from low cholesterol as
there is high cholesterol for your immune system cancer why because
cholesterol is needed to help heal the body and protect the immune system
cholesterol actually is needed to make bile it's needed to make stress hormones
I mean think about it your liver makes 2,000 milligrams of cholesterol every
single day why does your body make that much if it's bad it's not bad it's good
and because it actually is it's good in the right ratio so we you shouldn't be
afraid of cholesterol you just need to realize that we want the right amount of
it we want the exchange the good and bad we want that at the certain amounts and
if the cholesterol does go high it either is because you're eating too much
sugar or alcohol or you might not have enough bio to help break down that
cholesterol so a very important point okay another point in your thyroid
thyroid produces a hormone called T4 and a lot of times women take and men take
synthroid that's T4 that's the inactive form of thyroid hormone well did you
know that that gets converted through the liver to T3 but if you don't have
enough bile you can't convert it so a lot of times your thyroid problem is
really not a thyroid problem it's a gallbladder liver problem because
the conversion isn't there so here you are taking all this synthroid for years
and years and not seeing any results because this
is the culprit in fact the original cause of your slow thyroid it could be this
area right here important thing to know if your metabolism is slow so this I'm
telling you the importance of the gallbladder is it's huge
okay there's there's a couple things that can cause this gallbladder and the
duct to be smaller or pinched off and that could be stress because high
levels of cortisol going in the system or estrogen too much estrogen can also mess
up the gallbladder and that's why females that take hormone replacement
therapy or even birth control pills or even go through a pregnancy when they
have this huge spike of estrogen and they end up with a gallbladder problem well
guess where it came from excessive estrogen and then people have questions
about the gallbladder formula I have I'm just going to tell you what's in it
this is an extra-strength version I just added a new ingredient because I wanted
to add all the pancreatic enzymes so it has pancreas enzymes pancreas enzymes it
has purified bile salts it has the betaine hydrochloride so that actually helps
your stomach it has slippery elm bark to help lubricate this area right here and
has stone root to help break down any stones so it's a really great
combination to help support a healthy gallbladder so I hope you enjoyed this
series and if you have any questions please post them below and I'll see you
in the next video

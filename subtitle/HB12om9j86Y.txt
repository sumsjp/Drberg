recently I had a question about AIDS is there anything natural that someone
could do for AIDS so I found something very very interesting first let's talk
about what happens when you get dates you basically lose a good portion of
your immune system but there's this one key immune cell that HIV targets and
it's called the T helper cell the significance of this is that the T
helper cell is like the general of the army of your immune system it controls
and coordinates other immune cells in quantity and their weapon treat when the
T helper cells start to drop down to a certain level you really start losing
your immune system another name for the T helper cell is the cd4 cell also you
lose the ratio of your T helper cells to other T cells so that creates an
imbalance but when you get AIDS you start losing over 50% of your T helper
cells in your gut and that just creates a whole cascade of issues now when I was
researching natural remedies and herbs for AIDS I found a lot of herbs that
created no effect then what I did is I started researching if there is any
patents for natural remedies for AIDS because one of the cool things about
patents is they list out all their research and it has to be very credible
so it's really nice they summarize all the research on one simple page I found
something very very interesting I found this combination of herbs it's called
tang cao and I was blown away as I was reading through this patent because
there was phase 3 clinical trials it showed significant increase in the T
helper cell counts it showed properties of strengthen the immune system and with
low toxicity and virtually no adverse events there was less fatigue less hair
loss there was an improvement in appetite and less diarrhea apparently
this combination of herbs has the potential to decrease the HIV
replication and decrease secondary infections it's definitely a powerhouse
verbs that if I personally had AIDS I would be taking this immediately now
where can you get it I have no idea you're gonna have to do your research on
that and the problem with someone patenting a natural remedy is that you
may not find it available because they have the patents on it however I'm gonna
put a link down below of this patent and maybe you can order these herbs
individually you know that's one option as well if you can't find it but there
are other things that can also improve the T helper cell now you can get a
freeze-dried garlic which I would recommend or actually just consume
garlic in your food you want to crush it up before you consume it it can irritate
the stomach so that's why a lot of people get as a supplement but I would
recommend getting the freeze-dried garlic or the black garlic which is
fermented another herb bitter gourd is another good one to support the T helper
cells then you have another one called astragalus and then licorice root
ginseng all of these are other potential things that you could take to help
support the T helper cells now of course you also want to make sure that you're
doing healthy ketosis as well as intermittent fasting because those two in
combination can seriously improve your immune system you want to be taking a
lot of B vitamins your natural vitamin C complex as well as a vitamin E complex
just because when you have lower amounts of T helper cells you're gonna get a lot
of oxidative damage so you're gonna want these to help offset that thanks for
watching and before you click off check out this next part on a new immune
course that I just put together so I just spent the last two months creating
this amazing course called how to bulletproof your immune system and
there's 21 different lessons and I want to give you this course for free and the
problem I have with giving it free is sometimes people don't value it as much
but I want to get it out there so I'm just going to give it to you free and I
want to let you know that it's extremely extremely valuable right now we're in a
situation of uncertainty they're talking about a second wave and other people are
waiting for this miracle vaccine that may be
say who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room no one
is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm going
to teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you
can do to strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements
number one I want you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands
of people had this information to protect themselves but not only that
getting rid of the fear factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean
when you think about it it's very similar to someone being bullied in
school as soon as they learn self-defense they're gonna be less
adversely affected by these bullies so why not give you the information on your
immune system so you know what to do to protect yourself you see a lot of people
that are scared I see them on exercise like in in the park they're wearing a
mask while they're exercising or walking by themselves or in a car they're
wearing a mask and a shield so please share this course with everyone you know
if you want to help someone this is the best way to help them to give them the
knowledge of how to strengthen your immune system we want this to go viral
in a healthy way all right number two be active on your course and actually
complete the course okay take your time really learn the information there's
questions that you're gonna have to answer but stick with it but number
three send me your success when you complete
the course and sometimes when I talk to people they end the conversation with be
safe and I thought to myself what does that mean be safe well wear the mask and
also avoid getting too close to people right well that's cool but what about
strengthening the immune system that way you could be not just safe but you could
be very very smart because the missing link is a strong immune system that
gives you the ultimate protection I really believe that the best thing
that we can do both you and I to help people is to spread this out and get
everyone to know this information and here's what I came up with for the top
three people that share this course with the most people I'm gonna give them a
one-hour one-on-one video consult with Dr. Berg myself and we can talk about
anything or your health or whatever and then for the top 100 people that share
this course I'm gonna give this group video access to a very special webinar
that's going to be live on a topic that I can't necessarily do in a YouTube
video because it'll be taken down but just realize it's going to be some very
powerful information that you're gonna learn that's going to really help you
and people around you sorry to give you that mystery but
unfortunately social media is filtering out certain topics right now and the top
100 will also get access to my virtual keto summit at the end of August last
point do you get access to this information you have to have messenger
now some of you don't use messenger and unfortunately everything is set up a
messenger so I would recommend signing up a messenger and if you don't want to
continue use it after the course just opt-out I think you're really going to
enjoy this course I put a lot of time into it the information is down below
and spread the word

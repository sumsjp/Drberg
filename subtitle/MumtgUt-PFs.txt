hey guys dr. Berg here do you find that you're sleeping but you're not fully rested in the
morning when you wake up well this video is for you okay not normally when you go to sleep there
are four cycles of sleep okay they're waves of sleep patterns from a superficial to a
deep sleep superficial deep sleep through the night the superficial sleep is the REM sleep
that's a very active sleep but the deeper sleep is called the delta that's when you dream but
you don't remember your dreams okay you need to get the Delta wave in order to wake up feeling
rejuvenated so what happens is the quality of your sleep is poor and that's what causes this
problem I have people that sleep like nine hours and they're still tired that's insane so here's
what you need to know all stress accumulates in your body so everything from birth is has
affected our bodies and to some degree it kind of gets stuck in certain parts of the body and
also your adrenal glands don't really have an off switch and I've done a video on this before
if you understand the nervous system there's two parts is the sympathetic nervous system and the
parasympathetic nervous system sympathetic is the flutter flight the on switch parasympathetic
is the off switch calm relaxation sleep okay but the adrenal doesn't have a person pathetic
innovation it only has sympathetic which means that over time when the sympathetic starts getting
activated more and more it's more difficult to turn off so let's say you're go to bed at night
and you're laying there and you're not tired on your thinking or your head is just not tired but
your body's exhausted or your legs are restless or your heart feels like it's beating too fast
or you have tension in your neck so you want to first identify what part of your body will not
turn off okay now the adrenal glands are located in the abdomen and so a lot of times that's where
the area where people have like a lot of energy and electrical energy that just won't turn off
so I developed a technique it's an acupressure technique and you can learn it and you can use a
tool to actually extract the stress and I do this every night before I go to sleep and it really
can turn the body off so you can really relax so there's a technique for your upper part of
your neck okay when you're working the neck part and you're hitting these points right below the
skull there is a technique for the middle part of the neck and the lower part of the neck that
gets the neck to fully relaxed if your neck is tense you're not going to sleep then we work on
the opposite foot that's the back of the skull and you have all these attachments to the spine in the
skull you work on this point and it almost feels like your spine elongates when you do that then
we work on the muscles underneath your collarbone okay and that is muscles that a lot of people when
they're there slouching all day before their computer and they get tight you would want to
do those points as well and that frees up a lot of tension actually in your upper your back and
your traps then we get into my most favorite one which is the adrenal points now you're not working
on the adrenal glands themselves you're working on the acupressure points on the surface of the
skin so you would do both sides very close to the the midline you start in the lower part and
work yourself up and work out these points and you're going to feel pockets of tension
at first and you would hold those gently until it's fully melts to the point where your body
can only just like relax I will guarantee if you attempt to do this you will not make it through
these points you will fall asleep before you hit the points okay and there's some other points as
well comes with a little bit of a manual and you can learn this if you want to check it out
so I put a link down below to get the the tool it's a massage tool plus the manual and it comes
with videos as well so go ahead and check it out thanks for watching and put your comments below

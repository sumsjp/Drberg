hey I'm back and today we're going to talk about suppressing the infection
cycle is it a good idea or a bad idea let's say for example you're healthy
you're relatively young and don't have pre-existing health problems and you
start having a fever muscle ache flu-like symptoms a runny nose a cough
should you automatically start taking ibuprofen antibiotics some type of
medication to suppress these symptoms or not well let's take a look at what's
really happening internally specifically with viruses the virus first invades the
body and its goal is to get inside the cell so it starts to attach to your cell
and then it actually gets into the cell and then it opens up it takes the outer
part of it and just opens up and releases its RNA or DNA into your
cellular machinery and then once it hijacks gets into your cellular
machinery it starts to take over the copy machine so it can mass-produce now
when it does that your own body doesn't have access to that copy machine so as
the viral is using machinery it doesn't allow your own body to use that
machinery so then what happens is as the blueprints are copied they're sent to
other machinery of your cell to reproduce the actual cell itself so
these are the tiny machines that make proteins then when the virus is
replicated it can then be released through the cell and that's called
shedding so in this process if the virus is outside the cell it can't really do
anything to you once this virus gets in the cell it's hard for your immune
system to identify it but ourselves have adapted to countering this measure so
there's certain proteins in there that can detect the virus and those little
proteins will go to the surface of the cell and signal other parts of your
immune system that hey there's a virus inside the cell and it does it signaling
through certain cytokines so it's not a kind is really a communication that is
sent out to the immune system and there are different cytokines for different
things so you have cytokines that are also pro-inflammatory
they make inflammation and others that are anti-inflammatory as well so what
the cytokine is going to do it's going to send a signal out to various parts of
your immune system and what's going to be generated from that is a very
powerful antiviral cytokine or weapon it's called interferon so interferon is
the chemical that triggers certain symptoms of a virus infection
cough fever muscle ache flu-like symptoms so what you have to realize is
that when you have these symptoms it's not always the best thing to try to
suppress these because you're also going to suppress this interferon and
interferon comes from this word interfere because its function is that
it interferes with the virus reproducing so it's very very important to allow
interferon to do its job to decrease the reproduction of viruses if you're
healthy and you don't have a lot of pre-existing health problems and you're
not very old the best thing to do is to support the immune system not to
suppress it because they found that it's going to increase the duration of the
infection you're gonna be stuck with the infection a lot longer if you try to
suppress this mechanism also there's even studies that show that taking
something to suppress the immune system increases your mortality rate ideally
the best thing to do is let your body fight the infection and support the
immune system by getting on an eating plan that lowers your carbohydrates that
enhances vitamin D zinc and vitamin C these are crucial keeping your stress
down because stress will also prolong this infection and as far as the fever
goes you want to stay hot take a hot shower wear extra clothes when you're
going to bed to speed up the process because the fever is generated as an
antiviral action to suppress the reproduction of viruses anyway I wanted
to bring this up because a lot of people have these symptoms and they
automatically try to get rid of them they don't really understand what's
happening if you want more information about how to boost the immune system

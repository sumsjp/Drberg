hey guys in this video we're going to show you how to fix tight hamstrings
this technique can be used in any muscle in the body and it's something that's
very very different nothing that you've ever heard before but it's very very
effective not just in tight hamstrings but any tight muscle but we're going to
demonstrate on type hamstrings and I'm going to show you first of all why it
works and how it works and then we're going to demonstrate it okay so first of
all here's a leg looking from the side we have the back part right here which
is the bottom part called a hamstring and that's really really tight and what
happens is that when the person goes down it won't let him go down I used to
have really tight hamstrings and so if you stretch the hamstring if you stretch
the tight muscle it has a rubber band effect where it's just it's stretching
and it comes right back and it has to do with how the nerves are activated
anytime you stretch a muscle there's certain little nerve things in there
called stretch receptors that counter the stretch and that make it more tight
so stretching a tight muscle is not the best way to loosen a muscle what you
want to do is stretch the opposite muscle on the top part of the leg and
that is called the thigh muscle or the quadricep okay so by stretching the top
muscle it sends nerve signals to the hamstring to tell it to relax and turn
off and that has to do with any motion because if I'm moving my arm right now
this is activating and in order for this to move this has to send a signal to the
opposite muscle to relax it and that's why you could run and coordinate because
you have on-off on-off on-off switches going on constantly coordination between
the front muscle in the back and that provides motion so anytime you contract
a muscle or you massage a muscle the opposite muscle is going to be doing the
opposite action relaxing so this is going to long gait so if you want to
make the hamstrings longer and more relaxed we want to stretch the top
muscles right here and neurologically the signals will come through the spinal
column and relax your hands okay now it might sound kind of strange
because I went kind of fast but I'm just going to demonstrate so I have my person
right here that we're going to have you stand right here and now of course I'm
using him he doesn't necessarily have tight hamstrings but we can still
improve on his stretching so I'm going to go ahead and go ahead and just kind
of bring your feet a little bit outward yeah and go ahead and just touch your
toes as far as you can okay so we're looking he could pretty much touch his
fingers to the floor right there so that's pretty good so now we're going to
bring them up and then we're going to compare this and I'm going to take first
of all that chair if you can be that chair and you're going to take your your
foot and stretch like this okay yeah perfect and we're going to stretch this
muscle the front part right here and as you're stretching it you can kind of
just like stretch it and kind of do this backwards a little bit so you feel
tightness do you feel that okay good now do the other side and of course we're
doing a real quick demonstration but you could spend a long time stretching the
opposite muscle okay now we're going to do is we're going to
take a you can do this on your couch or your bed whatever
now you're going to actually kneel right here yes okay and now we're going to
stretch and kind of lean backwards and tell me where you feel this tightness do
you feel the tightness rather right there yeah okay so just relax for a
second let's do that three times
okay good step off here and we're going to move this back okay come back over
here okay so go ahead and bring your feet back a little bit now let's see how
far you can go down you can almost pull mitt yeah interesting eh so we didn't
even stretch his hamstrings we stretch the opposite muscle you can do this for
any muscle so that is how you can literally almost double your flexibility
without ever stretching the hamstrings okay so if you're if you like this
technique I have a download you can click below and I actually give you a
you can download a PDF it's for free on how to do this on all different muscles
and I go through step by step of giving you ideas of how to do it for the upper
back the shoulder whatever okay so I will see you on the next video

so today i want to talk about smartphone addictions in teens and children okay it's a big
problem there was a study done in 2016 involving 1,240 parents and they found that 50 of teens felt
addicted no surprise there 59 of parents believed that their kids were addicted okay 77 percent of
parents feel that their kids get distracted and lose attention that's uh no surprise of course
you're going to be distracted and 72 percent of teens felt that they needed to respond to text and
social media immediately when they get this like text message because texting you get like a 95
open rate so you have people that are just all day long just responding responding responding it's
training you to respond um versus email which is i think it's only like 15 or 20 percent
so it's definitely a problem because you're glued to this phone and you're literally
addicted i only check text messages maybe twice a day same thing with the email because i found that
i wasn't getting anything done at all because i'm constantly it and when you think about
multitasking you think you're gonna you're getting more stuff done you're not your power is in your
attention so you really wanna do what you're doing when you're doing it and not doing something
else by doing this thing over here 78 of teens check their devices at least hourly i think it's a
lot more frequent than that smartphone addictions are similar to drug addictions in that they do
influence the size and shape of certain parts of the brain specifically in the gray matter
the insula and the temporal cortex which is involved with emotion speech hearing sight memory
and self control they also found that there's more anxiety without your phone
and i think a lot of people um if they lose their phone or they forget their phone they
they freak out because it's their lifeline we depend on that phone
the problem is just the obsessive use of this phone and and what it can do to your body which
we're going to cover in a minute um there's less social interaction with people in front of you
because we're communicating through the phone and a lot of people have insomnia and fatigue
because of this cell phone and so what is the real damage with our cell phones it's the emf
electromagnetic fields there's two fields one is the electric fields which is different than
the magnetic fields i'm not going to get into the difference because i created a video on that which
i'll put a link down below but i found when i measured my house with an emf meter by my bed
there was a massive magnetic field because of the wiring in the back of the wall which
i had to hire an electrician to redo because i was literally being bathed in a sea of magnetic fields
and it was massively affecting my sleep cycle so i fixed that bam sleep like a baby now all
right so emf affects the brain and it affects the heart mainly but it affects other parts as well
it can even affect fertility so but if you put your cell phone in your pocket next to the gonads
you're literally sending microwaves into that area also the blue light from the devices
not just your cell phone but other devices affects melatonin so that's going to affect your sleep
so the main thing is damage control how can we reduce the effect of emfs in our body number one
avoid contact with your brain do not hold your cell phone up to your head also if you have those
earbuds or you have some type of earphones that go right into your brain there's a very specific type
you need to get i think it's called air buds or something where there's a space between your brain
and the wire so you're not driving this current or these these fields right into your brain which is
not good use the speaker on your phone but keep it away from your head very important and
really interesting when i was in practice i did a series of talks to the natural science institute
that's when i first got introduced to emf because there was a research scientist that came up to me
and said did you hear about some of the studies that they were doing on
children developing brain tumors from exposure to emf and i'm like really what so they were
already involved in the research and that increased my awareness on that connection
number two if you have a sleeping problem you don't want to use the cell phone two to three
hours before bed because the blue light is going to interfere with your ability to sleep
the circadian rhythm because it's going to affect melatonin and the next thing is that get an emf
uh protection case especially if you're carrying in your pocket you want to limit the amount
of exposure that you have the emf by having this this case that can help at least reduce
the exposure all right there you have it uh but check out the videos i have down below hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on
this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your
immune system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so
you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune
system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

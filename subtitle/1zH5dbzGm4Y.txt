now could fasting be the new antidepressant
I actually think so there's minimal side effects there's a lot of positive
amazing things that can happen your body that go way beyond just losing weight
and getting rid of your hunger but in this video we're going to talk about a
study that I found but I'll put the link down below that's actually very very
fascinating it involves improving your mood so in the study they found that the
orexin signaling activity has increased now what is orexin signaling activity
mean orexin is a chemical in the body that will increase wakefulness okay so
you'll feel more awake if you're depressed you're not very awake so this
is a very uplifting higher mood sensation also this will increase
dopamine which makes you feel better also it's associated with happiness
because low levels of this chemical will cause sadness and so many people when
they start doing a fast and they get past the first part where they have to
convert into ketones just start feeling really really good and they feel happier
for sure so number two fasting can increase endorphin release endorphins
give you the sensation of euphoria which is a pleasure sensation and also
endorphins decrease pain a lot of people get rid of their inflammation and pain
when they do fasting there's something about pain that actually makes you
depressed as well next thing that it will increase I'm not going to give you
a chemical name but it's CREB dash T F this compound signals certain genes that
increase serotonin it's been associated with people with a major depressive
disorder so when they test people with severe depression they find this factor
is low and fasting will increase it okay next thing it increases is something
called BDNF this is brain derived neurotrophic factor basically what that
is it's miracle grow for your
brain it helps you grow new brain cells so all these factors can be stimulated
just by fasting I mean take a look at the flipside the psych drugs are
required to put a black label it's because there's some serious serious
side effects not to mention covering up the real
cause of the problem and as you start taking it in a depressant you need more
and more of it because it doesn't work as well and then you have to add another
one and before you know it it doesn't work anymore so why not try something
that is so safe that seems to be very very effective and it's natural there's
some other things you can do as well fish or cod liver oil filled with DHA
and EPA is known to have an anti-depressive effect vitamin D is
known to reverse depression choline and whole eggs and by the way choline is in
whole eggs okay because this is involved in brain chemistry and there's a lot of
great nutrients in whole eggs that can also improve your mood your curcumin is a
very powerful antioxidant that can also help and also there's some research on a
high-fat diet that can help someone who's depressed and if we take a look at
the opposite effect on a low-fat diet that's when you actually increase the
risk of depression and other cognitive problems thus the ketogenic diet right
if you're new to my channel and you don't know how to do intermittent
fasting check out this video I put it right here

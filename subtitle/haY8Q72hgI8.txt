hey dr. Berg here in this short video we're gonna tell you about another tip
the fastest strategy to lose your belly now a strategy is an higher-level
thing that you do to get some advantage over things you have to realize this one
point that belly fat is not a weight problem it's a hormone problem it's a
high cortisol problem so the diets that don't diets don't work for this why
because diets don't lower cortisol they lower calories so they create stress
because belly fat is held there for a survival mechanism so in other words one
of the purposes of body holding fat in your belly is to protect you against
starvation now what starvation that's a diet every time you deprive yourself of
food and you lower your calories too much this will not help the cortisol the
other thing you want to be careful about is not to eat exercise too much so you'd
want to do long walks because exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate
the belly there's people I knew that you do boot camps and they actually add more
stress and they gain more weight from overtraining okay so don't diet don't
exercise now what do we have to do we have to do something to lower cortisol
cortisol is a hormone from the adrenals that is jacked up way too high it's an
overactive gland so we want to realize that the gland is triggered by all
stresses probably the biggest dress that you probably know about is other people
like at work or family whatever so you want to start to avoid stressful people
why because they will aggravate the adrenals so I know it's hard to live in
a bubble but try to minimize the amount of exposure you have on those stressful
personalities if possible but if you're in a relationship or your boss it is
difficult I know that but the more stress that you have with people you
have to counter it by doing things that are anti stress like sleeping you have
to sleep longer but I know a lot of you can't
so I recommend two things for sleep we use adrenal formula fatigue formula
right before bed it'll put you out you'll sleep there's no side effects
there's no drugs or anything adrenal before bed and then acupressure we
use acupressure either in the clinic or we can do it you can do it on yourself
we show you how to do that but acupressure it literally will pull
stress out of your body and help you sleep it's one of the most effective
things to lower the stress level in the body so those are the kind of the to
notice I said strategy I didn't say all the little tiny details you just need a
higher level strategy versus what everyone else does is going on a diet
trying to exercise it off or burn more calories that is the wrong strategy okay
hope that helped I'll see you in the next one

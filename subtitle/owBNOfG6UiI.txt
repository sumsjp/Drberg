i want to talk about insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis now first of all let's talk about
what gluconeogenesis is glucose means glucose it's sugar neo means new and genesis means the
creation of so gluconeogenesis is the new creation of glucose made by your liver and it's stimulated
by a hormone called glucagon and it's inhibited or turned off by your favorite hormone called insulin
which is triggered by more glucose from the diet but what happens with gluconeogenesis is the body
is making new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources so it's making sugar out of protein
out of fat out of ketones why because there's always a certain amount of sugar that your body
does need and it's not required to come from the diet your body can make it from other sources
but what happens when you have insulin resistance things kind of become a little crazy because
insulin resistance is a kind of a precursor for pre-diabetes and when you have pre-diabetes you
have insulin resistance but also you're going to have insulin resistance when you become a diabetic
so when someone starts to cut out their carbohydrates because they're a pre-diabetic
or a diabetic or they're on the ketogenic diet because they finally realized that diabetes or
pre-diabetes is high sugar and having a high carb diet contributes to that and it makes it worse
they finally had that realization so now what they're going to do is cut the carbs out but
when they check their sugars sometimes their sugar is too high now how can that be they're not eating
any sugar well if you're not eating any sugar and you have high sugar that means it must be coming
from gluconeogenesis now the question is why would the body be making more sugar well because
the sensor the turn off signal the off switch is apparently not there in sufficient quantities so
obviously you don't have enough insulin because the insulin resistance is so strong you have so
much resistance that insulin is not able to get through and so your body is sensing a low
insulin situation so then it's just going to make more sugar so if the blood sugars are that high
then that's the reason why oh i made a run just give it more time keep doing keto keep doing
fasting and eventually the insulin resistance will improve to the point where your liver won't
keep making sugar anymore so we really have two situations we have insulin resistance over here
and then we have the pancreas making insulin over here the beta cell and the pancreas makes insulin
and so the pancreas cell will make more insulin if you're eating more sugar why because it's
trying to compensate for that and as you're making more insulin the insulin resistance will become
more resistive simply because you have too much insulin because your carbs are too high so there's
really two situations going on so here's what happens okay so you have this insulin resistance
and then eventually you become a pre-diabetic now that's where the blood sugars are starting
to creep up to a certain amount not astronomical but just a certain amount
so obviously there's not enough insulin to push it down because of the insulin resistance so this
goes on for a period of time as a pre-diabetic and then eventually you become a diabetic
where the blood sugars start going really out of control and that is a major deficiency
of insulin both because we have the insulin resistance and because the pancreas cell now
can no longer compensate and make this excessive amount of insulin to keep your blood sugars in
check so we have a situation where we have insulin resistance and a complete exhausted pancreas
and if the person keeps doing more and more carbs then the doctors will eventually give
you insulin on top of that so i mean the whole thing could be prevented and treated
just by getting off these down carbs but that never happens we use these medications
to manipulate these values unfortunately the whole point of this video is to tell you that
we also have another situation involved in diabetes and that is this gluconeogenesis
this liver making sugar okay so this goes beyond the carbs in the diet so when you're diabetic
a major contributing factor to your blood sugars is gluconeogenesis the liver is making
new sugar so the solution or the answer to this is number one get unhealthy keto cut the carbs down
make sure you provide all the nutrients and the phytonutrients to counter all the complications
that occur and then give it time because it's going to take time to reverse this
it may take months to even a couple years so don't give up if you run into a barrier find
the solution and stick with it so if you're enjoying my content which i hope you are

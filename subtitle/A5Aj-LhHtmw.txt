so I recently had someone comment on one of my videos if rice is so bad why are
the Chinese so thin right well the Chinese are not as thin as you think
from 1985 to 2015 that was a massive spike of obesity in children and I'm not
even talking about being overweight I'm talking about classified as obese for
boys it was an increase by 14 times and for girls the obesity increase was 11x
that's crazy I mean the Chinese once were considered one of the leanest
populations of the entire world now it's ranked second behind the U.S. I
wonder why well because they're eating like
Americans so yes the Chinese always consumed rice
okay but let's just take a look at what they consumed in the early 90s versus
right now it was a lot less sugar 1.7 kilograms of sugar now it's 7.7
kilograms of sugar they consumed a lot more vegetables than they do now
they consumed fish a lot of seafood food was primarily boiled as compared to now
it's fried they consumed more fermented foods like NATO miso kimchi now it's a
lot less and the western food and beverage companies helped shape the
science and public policy and obesity in China so the recent trends in America of
consuming liquid candy I'm sorry soda is actually going down so the
beverage companies now are marketing heavily in other countries like Mexico
and especially China so in China there is a lot more sugar being consumed a lot
more snacking going on also the amount of soy back in 1995 14 tons of soy
consumed and it was non-gmo now it's actually 70 million tons with the
majority of that being imported and it's most of it's going to be GMO China
actually produces half of the world's poor and most of the pigs are fed soy so
in summary the Chinese are not getting thinner they're getting fatter and it's
not because of the rice it's because of the sugar and the refined carbohydrates
and this soy products are also contributing to this problem as well if

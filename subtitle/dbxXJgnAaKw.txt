so I had another question about apple cider vinegar and is it okay
is it safe to use on your hair so let's talk about that
so there's many benefits of taking the outside of vinegar internally for your
digestion for your blood sugars and you can also put it on your skin topically
because your skin is slightly acidic okay and I'm talking about the scalp as
well so by using apple cider vinegar correctly you can do several things
number one you can help to restore the pH of the scalp you can actually give
your hair a nice shine and it can also clean up some of the residues that you
get when you use shampoos and conditioners and as a side note I highly
recommend getting a filter that can pull out chlorine and fluoride from your
water because those two chemicals are halogens and they're very reactive on
your skin which can give you all sorts of acne type issues they could damage
the hair so here's what you don't want to do you don't want to apply the
opposite of vinegar directly in the concentration that it normally comes in
because that could damage the hair you want to use a dilution of one tablespoon
for 16 ounces of water and you don't want to have it sit in the hair for a
long period of time you want to basically use it as a rinse after you
use the shampoo and conditioner if that's what you use
and I also recommend not doing every single day maybe once or twice a week is
fine and I think you're gonna notice a huge change in the quality of your hair

hey guys today we're gonna talk about how to look at least 10 years younger
okay so I'm 54 years old going on 29 and my wife is 55 and I'm gonna tell you our
secret but if I tell you this you have to promise not to tell anyone okay
you're gonna have to sign off on the comment below and say you won't tell
anyone this is just between you and me in the four walls and I'm just being
totally kidding around because this is really it's not really a secret it's
just very basic common sense because if you think about it if you want really
useful skin what does skin man have fat in protein
okay is it made out of unsaturated fats no it's made out of saturated fats so
take a wild guess what you should be eating more of that's right
cholesterol and saturated fats the exact things that they tell you not to eat I
mean think about if you go in a low-fat diet you start getting old really fast
so if you want aging skin just starve yourself of fats okay especially
saturated fats all right now what does cholesterol and saturated fats do for
you well there's three things 50% of your cell membranes are made out of
cholesterol okay because we meet cholesterol body makes it and we need it
from our diet it also helps you make bile to help you digest the fat that
you're eating especially to extract the fat soluble vitamins out of that fat
also the cholesterol is needed to make hormones because as you know as you get
older you lose your hormones you look older right so we want to make sure the
food the precursors the raw material for your hormones are there very very
important now under ball the fats and vitamins the vitamin A is the most
important anti-aging fat soluble vitamin for your skin okay the epidermis and the
dermis the different layers of the skin are controlled by vitamin a and if you
have enough vitamin A your skin will be soft and firm and it won't be so dry
because vitamin A deficiency it creates dry skin scaly skin it's
called actually corn avocation which is real
rough skin you get acne I don't know if you knew this but the genes that make
collagen need vitamin A so vitamin A triggers the production of collagen now
where do you get vitamin A well you can get it from leafy greens right but the
beta carotene in the leafy greens including kale and spinach and other
greens is a precursor it's not that retinal the active form of vitamin A it
has to be converted into the active form so it's important to consume these
things the exact oxidants these phytonutrients but if you're doing high
amounts of beta-carotene without enough of these active forms your skin is not
going to look as youthful you really need the active form of vitamin A so
guess where you get vitamin A egg yolks okay cod liver oil butter salmon fish
goats cheese make sure that the color all you get is virgin cod liver oil it's
just a higher quality make sure the eggs that you consume are pasture raised
organic very important the next important vitamin would be vitamin E ok
vitamin E protects the skin against aging against sunburns against oxidizing
ok it will prevent wrinkles too it actually is anti scarring and it
supports your pituitary hormones ok so it's another key nutrient to help as a
building block especially if you're going through menopause as you get older
your ovaries go in hibernation they go in retirement they don't work anymore
so that means you don't need as many sex hormones so the pituitary doesn't output
as many hormones and the vitamin E starts dropping down you need vitamin E
for those sex hormones so it's very very important to have vitamin E where do you
give at a mini well you get it from palm oil eco-friendly of course especially
the red palm oil leafy greens you can get it from wheat germ oil I don't like
that source but you can olive oil seeds and nuts and a lot of the other foods
that I mentioned about vitamin A also have vitamin E now the other thing
on the flipside that you need to focus on is what to avoid okay the number one
thing to avoid to prevent aging skin is AGEs just so happens that stands for
age this stands for advanced glycation end-products now what is that basically
when you combine protein and sugar or protein with fat like in a deep-fried
doughnut or french fries or if you're taking protein like barbecued ribs and
you're actually compiling all that sugar with the protein you create these sticky
proteins and the protein starts getting sticky and it starts clogging everything
up in the eye and the artery and your glands but it's gonna make your skin
look very very old very very fast smoking is gonna age the skin and of
course smoking actually causes these advanced glycation end-products as well
stress we want to avoid cortisol cortisol in high amounts ages the skin
so definitely avoid these things right here and of course sugar avoid sugar and
refined carbohydrates simply because that's going to oxidize and aged things
very very fast so this is just one more reason that the healthy ketogenic diet
is important if we also add intermittent fasting to this we can accelerate it
even more because we get repair actions and when you're doing intamin fast and
you go through autophagy which kind of cleans out these damaged proteins that
are unusable now so you can clean up the old stuff within intermittent fasting and
with healthy keto add enough saturated fats to provide these nutrients and
other nutrients to start looking younger so thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating

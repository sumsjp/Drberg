so today we're going to talk about what type of nutrients you should take
when you do a fast now when you're doing intermittent fasting
on a daily basis it's less important than when you're doing prolonged fasting
like 48 72 hours or even much longer what you
have to realize is that most people going into a fast
are already deficient of some nutrient so fasting basically exaggerates that
deficiency what we're trying to avoid when we're
doing a fast is to avoid certain nutritional
deficiencies that create symptoms like dizziness fainting
fatigue a rash that's developed some muscle cramp
leg cramp some palpitation in your heart or a heart arrhythmia
or feeling cold now this is a topic that has a lot of different variables you
have a person's overall diet before they
started a fast they might have been on a diet with high
nutrient dense foods for years or maybe they're a diabetic or pre-diabetic
where they have insulin resistance and then if there's certain goals that
you have let's say for example you have an autoimmune disease you have a lot of
inflammation in the body or let's say you're trying to improve
your immune system to fight off some cancer having these
nutrients in your body while you're doing fasting i think is a really good
idea of course this goes against the true
definition of a fast where you're basically eating nothing
taking nothing except you're drinking water but if
you're consuming nutrients and or herbs there's not going to be
very many calories involved so it's not going to necessarily bump
you out of ketosis it's not going to affect the benefits of
fasting too much and not just by preventing a nutrient
deficiency but providing nutrients that enhance the
antioxidant networks in your body your body makes antioxidants and you can
also get them from your diet those nutrients can enhance your own
body's antioxidant network this definitely applies to if someone
has inflammation or even they're trying to handle cancer
because you're getting a tremendous amount of free radical damage
and we know fasting already will help that but if we compound that with
certain nutrients i think we can actually even have a
bigger impact as a very minimum if you're doing fasting
number one and number two i think our requirements
taking electrolytes especially a good amount of potassium
magnesium sodium and chloride this is salt
and then you have the b vitamins you can get these
through nutritional yeast which will not provide
very many calories but can provide a natural source of the b vitamins
you don't want to do the synthetic versions and then the longer you
fast the more you're going to need additional nutrients especially trace
minerals and especially zinc selenium and iodine
because you don't have a mechanism in your body
that you can store zinc for probably more than about a
couple days since a lot of people are already
deficient in zinc selenium and iodine doing a fast will really make them
deficient so trace minerals are also very very
important and then you have vitamin d now normally we do store vitamin d for a
period of time it's a fat soluble vitamin but most people are deficient in vitamin
d going into a fast this would be a really
important one to get as a supplement or get it from the sun
if you took cod liver oil you would get not only vitamin d
you would also get vitamin a at the same time
as well as dha and epa which are omega-3 fatty acids so
that's why i like cod liver oil and then we have vitamin
c you have usually about two weeks of vitamin c reserve in your body
so it really depends on what you eat when you eat
to whether you have enough vitamin c in your reserve
you also have vitamin e you have k2 that are also very important but these
two categories right here are a must and then these are also
important if you're going longer and longer now there are two nutrients
that you probably don't need when you're doing a fast number one is iron
most people especially men have way too much iron
it could eventually lead to cirrhosis or scar tissue of your liver
and you can have fatigue arthritis and the list goes on and on
so i definitely do not recommend taking any type of iron
supplements calcium is another mineral that i think a lot of people
have too much of but it could be other factors too like
they don't have enough k2 to transport the calcium and these are
two minerals that usually most people have too much of so
we don't want to supplement them there's another thing i want to talk
about which i already mentioned but i want to elaborate on it
and that's taking herbal supplements or certain food concentrates when you're
doing a fast for the antioxidant benefits and
a lot of the phytonutrients which are not essential but they're an extra thing
that gives some really amazing added benefits to your
health number one if you have diabetes or some
autoimmune disease or whatever those can target
the free radical damage and minimize the collateral damage
from those free radicals they can bring down inflammation
there's so many benefits including anti-cancer benefits
so we have green tea and there's other types of tea that will create some
similar effects as well garlic and capsules will give you some real
strong anti-viral and anti-cancer effects and then you have the wheatgrass
juice powder which is a super concentrated amount of
chlorophyll carotenoids a lot of other nutrients and then of
course you have turmeric which you can get in a powder
or a supplement there's a lot of different things you can take these are
four real good ones but when you're fasting why not do things that will
compound your results and give you more benefits alright guys
so if you haven't seen my video on all the
side effects to fasting and the remedies i put that video up right here check it

let's talk about how to reverse engineer a heart attack this is the number one reason why people
die on the planet heart attacks okay so i think it's important to reverse engineer this problem
and see what you can do to avoid getting this problem so typically what happens is the artery
becomes blocked and that shuts off blood supply to the heart muscle and the heart cramps and you die
now if you can go into the future with a heart attack and let's say you didn't die but you had
a heart attack you might be reflecting back on your life and saying gosh what what could i have
done differently were there any clues to tell me this was coming okay i want to tell you a little
story i um i had this red truck it's a pickup truck there's a piece of crap and the engine was
doing all these different things and i noticed these uh lights were going on the dashboard
the engine was getting overheated all the stuff right and i could have just kept driving
but i pulled off to the gas station and i looked at the engine i didn't see anything and i happened
to open up the valve where the coolant is right there's no any freeze so i'm driving this truck
without anything to cool it down right i'm like oh my gosh i'm so glad i paid attention
to that warning sign and did something about it so with a heart attack there's all sorts of
warning signs that your body will typically give you okay but not all the time because over fifty
percent of heart attacks there's no symptoms okay so unfortunately there's not these clues
but when there is clues that's a good thing we should not ignore these clues one of the biggest
problems that i see with people is when they go to the doctor they're covering up these clues with
medications like for example shortness of breath which could mean that there's a problem with the
heart and then the person gets on a medication called atrovent to cover up that symptom right
problem is still there but now we don't have the awareness that it's there then we have high blood
pressure right let's treat that with lisinopril cover up the symptom problem's still there right
but without the awareness other symptoms that there's some type of blockage in the heart
especially with the heart muscle is when you get chest pain when you exercise or go through stress
that's a that's a really big clue or you might get weakness when you're climbing up stairs right
because you're stressing the heart which is a pump supposed to push blood to the body to carry
oxygen and if you can't do that you're going to have problems when you exert yourself okay
you might have more fatigue when you exercise all clues that could help you investigate this more
and potentially see if there's a problem there so you can then do something about it okay now
with the chest pain there's going to be either a pain down into the left shoulder down into the arm
into the jaw or up through back through here okay so that's that's one thing you should know
but the most important thing which is not really emphasized with heart attacks is that it usually
starts with endothelial dysfunction okay what does that mean it means there's damage on the
inside of the arteries especially the coronary artery on the heart so that gives us a really
good idea of what causes this problem some type of oxidation or inflammation on that artery that then
creates a cascade of effects of cholesterol building up protein calcium deposits etc
and what's supposed to protect that inside of the artery is vitamin e very important vitamin c
very very important and one of the biggest things that will cause the destruction of vitamin e and
vitamin c is you guessed it glucose and other types of sugars as well as refined carbohydrates
okay all those carbohydrates are going to deplete the antioxidants and create this inflammation in
your arteries and so if you're new to my channel i put a link down below of what you need to do
if you've been watching my channel this is just another reminder of why you should do healthy keto
in intermittent fasting and so you want to look at symptoms as warning signs as communications
from your body to tell you there's a problem but symptoms are not the problem and as you treat
these symptoms realize you must also understand the symptom and do something to actually fix
the reason why it's there in the first place thank you so much for watching i will see you
in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

hey guys I had another question about
what to do with thick mucus in the
sinuses or the lungs okay this will be a
real short video because there's one
herb that I always recommend called Venu
Greek you can get it online or at a
health the store but basically it thins
the viscosity of mucus it's a mucus
solvent so it'll break up all the thick
mucus so you'll cough it up thanks for
watching hey you probably already
subscribed but if you haven't press this
little button down below and I will keep
you updated

so the question for today is how long will you live so go ahead and put that down in the
comment section the oldest person documented that ever lived was Jeanne Calment she lived to be 122.
now currently as of the 4th of january 2021 the oldest living person is a woman living in japan
and she's 118 years old and the second oldest living person is 116 years old a woman living
in france the third is 116 years old in brazil and then it goes down the list from there to 115.
france 115 japan 115 brazil 115 brazil and all the way down to number 49
we get a man who's 111 living in spain now what's interesting about this is the first 50 people
are all women okay so women do live longer than men about seven to eight years longer
now on average in the u.s men live to be 76.1 years and women lived to be 81.1 years
so to me that's actually pretty young compared to these people over here now i'm 55 right now
so if i live to the average number of years i have 21 more years to go that doesn't seem like
a lot of time but if i actually reach this goal right here i have about 56 years to go which is
roughly at the halfway mark which actually i like this one a lot better so i am actively
doing things every single day as far as diet and exercise and environmental things to extend
my life because i want to be around as long as possible so the question is what are you
doing right now that is extending your life are you eating correctly do you know what to eat
if you don't i put a link down below you can check it out but getting back to why women live longer
there's three reasons number one they have more estrogen than men and estrogen can help express
genes that make more antioxidants which will help to counter free radical damage which will
lessen the damage to the dna and the mitochondria and they have less rates of getting cancer etc
number two they have a better immune system than men the immune system in a female
ages slower especially the t cells and the b cells and on top of that they have more killer t cells
so men need to work twice as hard to keep their immune system strong and realize that the immune
system is not just about fighting pathogens and preventing infections it's about killing cancer
as well so make note of that all right number three women overall have a lower production
of oxidants those things that can cause oxidation of the cells and your mitochondria which is the
energy factor of the cells in fact they produce one half the hydrogen peroxide than men produce
and hydrogen peroxide is a very powerful oxidation compound that your body uses for
fighting pathogens and other things as well also women produce twice as much glutathione
which is a very powerful antioxidant than men so i have to work twice as hard as my wife to keep
the oxidants low and the antioxidants very very high if you want additional tips on anti-aging
i put those links down below check them out before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

so let's talk about conjunctivitis okay that's pink eye
now nothing that I say in here is meant to replace your medical care check with
your doctor before taking any of this advice now this condition could be viral
or could be bacterial the bacterial infections tend to be higher in young
children but not always it could be viral so what I want to do is just focus
on the viral cause to this condition the symptoms are itchiness watery eyes
red eyes swollen eyelids burning eyes light sensitivity so what we're dealing
with about sixty to ninety percent of the time is a virus called the
adenovirus this is the same virus behind the common cold and there's really no
medical treatments to cure this virus FYI and there's 50 different strains of
it so usually what happens is you're susceptible to it your immune system is
weakened and you get exposed to it somehow and it gets into the eye and creates
inflammation so conjunctivitis is inflammation of a conjunctiva now what
is that that is the membrane on the outside of your eyeball and as well as
the inside of your eyelid okay and it gets all red and swollen it's highly
contagious and it can be contagious for 10 to 12 days and so you rub your eye
get infected and now you have an infection it could last between one and
three weeks now what can you do about this is there anything well yes there is
something that can help this and it's zinc okay 50 milligrams per day now the
thing about zinc is that zinc helps to decrease the reproduction of the virus
so the problem is if you're taking zinc too late in the chain of events it may
not do much to the virus because the virus is already into its reproduction
cycle because zinc actually reduces the reproduction of the virus so if you take
it too late in a chain the virus has already reproduce it's creating chaos in
the body however there's other benefits
in other parts of the immune system ideally we want to take the zinc right
away so if there are people that have colds around you for example start
taking zinc that would be a good thing to take or if you just start seeing the
pinkeye start taking it immediately because the faster you take it the
better you can actually slow down this process and speed up the recovery so the
other thing you want to do is just support the body with natural things and
good eating begin let it run its cycle because as soon as you start suppressing
some of the symptoms guess what the duration of that infection potentially
could be longer and longer alright thanks for watching

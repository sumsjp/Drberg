so today we're going to talk about keto rash this is an updated video from my
last video I haven't done one on this and I want to give you a little bit of a
deeper understanding of what's behind the keto rash what happens when you go
on a keto diet is you make several changes usually you don't make changes
to the amount of protein that you eat but you do make changes to the amount of
carbohydrates you eat as well as amount of fats and in this case it's really the
increase in dietary fat that is causing the rash because your body needs some
time to adjust and adapt to the amount of fat that you're consuming because on
a ketogenic diet it could be between 70 to 80 percent of all your calories fat
and so if you're taking that in and you don't have the ability to digest it
that's where we have a problem so the two things that help you digest fat is
bile salts okay bile salts are made by the liver and stored in the gallbladder
so if you have anything wrong with this that could magnify things like at fatty
liver or you don't have a gallbladder or you just haven't adapted to produce
enough bile now the purpose of bile is to break down the fat and to extract the
fat soluble vitamins from the fat that you're eating and the essential fatty
acids as well like omega-3 fatty acids and quite a few other ones so if you
don't have enough file to extract that from the diet guess what you could end
up with a vitamin A deficiency and vitamin A deficiency are directly
connected to what's going on with your skin and then we have a vitamin D
deficiency vitamin D is crucial for preventing things like psoriasis and
inflammation in general including the skin and then we kept a vitamin E
deficiency and vitamin E is very very connected to your skin health bile is
also needed to help detoxify the liver so potentially there could be toxins
that are not coming out for the body and if you look up various conditions with
the gall bladder rashes are a symptom and
dermatitis is also another symptom however there's another condition a skin
condition that you'll read about when you search on keto rash and that's
called prurigo pigmentosa now this is a skin condition which they don't have a
clue what causes it okay it's sometimes it's called idiopathic which means
unknown cause but if you look this skin condition up sometimes it occurs after
the person had their gallbladder removed or it can occur if the person has
problems with their bile ducts that are connected to the gall bladder by adding
purified bile salts to your diet potentially you could help reduce this
right here now the other vitamin that's connected to the Quito rash is a
deficiency of b2 riboflavin another name for b2 is vitamin G and I would always
use vitamin G for liver conditions that work great on that and also helped the
skin as well so just so you know biome in b2 is a co factor or a helper vitamin
in fat metabolism also you add more fat to the diet the requirement from b2 goes
up and if you don't take enough b2 you could be deficient and one of the big
symptoms of the b2 deficiency is pellagra which can also give you a skin
issue now does this mean that if you have a subclinical deficiency of b2
you're gonna have pellagra I have no idea all I'm doing is showing you the
connection I do know that it does support your liver so really what's
happening is that we're increasing the demand for fat without the amount of
bile that's needed to digest the fat so the first thing I would recommend is to
get some purified bile salts take it right after the meal okay each meal and
you may even need to reduce the amount of fats to make it easier on your system
and you should see an improvement in your skin rash if you want additional
information about purified bile salts I put a link down below thanks for

let's talk about how tallow beef fat can potentially help you lose weight check this
out before crisco came around tallow was the most popular fat to cook with
people use it in recipes soups and stews and then comes crisco for 97 years crisco
was promoted as something that was healthier than this saturated fat even though it was a trans fat
made from a vegetable oil i think it was cottonseed oil so they took this cottonseed oil
put it under high heats with aluminum to make it hydrogenated thicker and it was promoted as
a healthy thing for a very long time and then in 1970 there was a big emphasis with this
food pyramid in relationship between saturated fat equals heart disease and so there's been
this mission to get everyone to replace their saturated fats with the seed oils okay the omega
6 fatty acid highly inflammatory highly oxidative oils which actually create heart disease and
then in 1970 food pyramid came out and said that saturated fats are now the cause of heart disease
so we can now again switch to seed oils in fact the truth is seed oils create a tremendous amount
of oxidation whereas saturated fats are very stable and so it's really the seed oils that
have created this it's really the trans fats that have been creating the heart disease
for all these years we've been fed false data now tallow creates very little oxidation
but how can it help you lose weight number one it's very high in a type of fat called cla which
increases fat burning okay now number two tallow is extremely satisfying it's loaded with vitamin a
d e and omega 3 fatty acids like dha which is going to allow you to fast a lot longer and
the more you fast and do intermittent fasting the more you're going to reduce insulin and the more
you're going to lose weight if you don't have a very good fat to use on your healthy keto plan
with the fat soluble vitamins you're not going to feel as satisfied so you're not
going to be able to fast as long as you should and then you're not going to lose as much weight
number three calo decreases cravings and hunger for the carbohydrates
so you'll end up eating less carbohydrates now when you eat a meal do you ever feel like you're
missing something or you're not satisfied you might even be stuffed but you still need something
what you're needing is these right here you need a good high quality fat with fat soluble vitamins
number four fat compared to carbs and protein is the only thing that doesn't trigger
insulin now it's true that any anytime you eat you're going to trigger insulin a little bit
but the point is the fat is neutral and it won't trigger insulin like these other things right here
so that means less insulin more weight loss number five you're going to have less gut inflammation
which is going to lead to less insulin resistance because the more inflammation you have the more
insulin resistance the higher the insulin when you're doing tallow i recommend you do organic
i recommend you do grass fed all right in summary you don't have to be afraid of it
despite the 97 years of false data and lies hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

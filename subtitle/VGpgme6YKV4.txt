so today we're going to talk about this word intermittent
we're going to talk about intermittent fasting and the big mistake that people
make as well as intermittent exercise okay
and how that relates to your overall health
now a healthy body has really good circadian
rhythms okay those are natural waves of rhythm
and i'm talking about sleep cycles eating cycles
rhythms of digestion rhythms of hormones which follow certain type of wave
patterns growth hormone cortisol anything that we
do of a sustained nature adds more
stress to the body let me explain let's take eating for example one of the
most important things that intermittent
fasting will do is it corrects your digestion
because our body was not designed to be consuming on a sustained basis
our body's not designed to snack in between
every single meal why because you stimulate insulin over and over and over
and we know what happens with that we get this
insulin resistance situation then we get a pre-diabetes
and then we get diabetes what is diabetes
it's an uncontrolled blood sugar so your blood sugar is too high
because your insulin is all messed up and why did that happen because you
created a sustained stimulation of your insulin
so one of the most important things to do
is don't eat anything when you are fasting and also allow your body
too fast a certain part of the day what i see is happening for a lot of
people is they're doing a little bit of snack
between their meals here and there and that actually kind of ruins the great
benefit of fasting when you're fasting you don't want to
eat anything you can drink some water but ideally
stay true to the definition of fasting which basically you're not eating
anything so what's going to happen is you're going to get a lot more benefits
to that because sometimes people become lacks and
really they're they think they're doing fasting but
they're doing a little snack here but they say well it's not carbs
it's just a little protein right well protein will activate
insulin so we want to practice in a minute of fasting
and definitely want to get rid of that breakfast there and maybe do two meals a
day and then maybe do one but then do a true
fast now i do recommend taking supplements
during that period of time but supplements don't really have many
calories we're just doing b vitamins uh we're doing electrolytes things like
that now let's shift to exercise let's take a look at high intensity
interval training okay which is intermittent so you're
going to do this high intensity you're not going to do it sustained
you're going to do it intermittently right so what is the benefit of this
well you're going to stimulate growth hormone
why is this so beneficial because when you do it intermittently
you do not over stimulate the opposing hormone which is cortisol so we
keep the stress down but we activate the growth hormone growth hormone is
stimulated by the entire intensity but
cortisol is stimulated by the duration a long duration
of exercise so what's very very stressful in your body
is like a marathon because it's sustained at a pretty good pace
you have to have very good adrenals to do marathons or triathlons
what happens when you're doing a high intensity interval training
cycle here you're activating something called the sympathetic nervous system
okay so we're stimulating the pulse rate muscle activation and then there's going
to be a point where you're going to stop right when you hit a certain duration
and a certain intensity and you want to keep this fairly short
as soon as you stop this exercise the parasympathetic
nervous system which is the opposing part of the nervous system kicks in and
becomes active and this system is an active
push down wave that is going to push down your pulse rate and calm you down
it's not passive it's active it's the same
system that is helping you sleep at night
when this system is broken then the system takes over and everything is like
high level pulse rate nervous can't relax
can't sleep why because of a sustained stimulation
of this stress right here when you do high intensity interval training
it's vitally important to be at a complete stop
at this point until you fully recover so you don't want to get your pulse rate
really high and then jog in place no you want to actually just sit down
let your pulse rate come down to a good place
and then you can start back up so number two
you want to stop exercise at some point after the activation and
really allow your body to recover why because this is what's missing in most
people is a recovery and this is why the
interval training is vitally important now you can also apply
this to other things as well because if you're consuming caffeine all day
and you're stimulating and stimulating you're going to not allow your body to
calm down you're eventually going to be tired and require more stimulants so
that will just burn you out and affect your ability to sleep
which is key with recovery same thing with mental stress
if you're actively in stress all day long and you try to go to sleep
it's not going to work so you want a period of downtime
you want to go for a long walk you want to get out in nature so
during the downtime when you're relaxing you want to get off your cell phone
because i see so many people when they're trying to relax they're on their
cell phone well this is like stimulation stimulation
okay the other thing is that you don't want to
go for a long walk and be solving problems because you're going to
activate the adrenal cortisol adrenaline people actually
think that they're not productive because they're
not solving problems so they have to be thinking so much
well i think it's going to be a lot more beneficial when you walk
and just get your space and oxygen and relax
just for 30 to 60 minutes a day also in your house you have these
artificial lights the the screen in front of your computer
you want to get more sunlight to balance out this
artificial light that you've been exposed to all
right well thanks for watching i'll see in the next video

let's talk about the benefits of ginkgo
as in ginkgo biloba now ginkgo is a tree
and usually when you buy this product
it's the leaf of the tree
this tree though has been found in
fossils dating back 270 million years
ago so it's been around a very very long
time it's grown in china japan and korea
and it's good for
memory
circulation bronchitis arthritis all the
itis
it's antimicrobial
good for anxiety
will help you increase libido decrease
tinnitus which is ringing in the ear
it can even improve your vision but if
you look at the studies they're mixed
okay and really that has to do with
other factors for example if your diet
is crappy this is not going to work
but if your diet is good it may help you
now the main factor in ginkgo biloba in
addition to the antioxidants and the
phytonutrients is its ability to
increase nitric oxide which by the way
is different than nitrous oxide that you
would get when you go to the dentist the
laughing gas which i don't recommend by
the way but nitric oxide is a
vasodilator another name for it is
endothelium derived relaxing factor
and basically what it does in your
arteries is it relaxes the smooth muscle
in the arteries and it creates a
vasodilation so you get more blood flow
more circulation more oxygen
to different parts of your body to your
brain so you can actually have more
memory
to your uh lower legs so you have uh
better circulation there's a condition
called
intermittent claudication in which your
legs become very painful when you exert
yourself or do exercise so this is good
for that and as a side note nitric oxide
comes from nitrates and vegetables
actually contain nitrates so when you
consume vegetables you're you are
increasing this compound
it's just really good for people with
high blood pressure and that need to
increase more oxygen anyway there you
have it the short summary of the
benefits of gingko

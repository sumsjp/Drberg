so i wanted to give you an alternative protocol
for steroids especially prednisone cortisone
anything related to the synthetic version of cortisol like prednisone
steroids anti-inflammatories simply because the side effects from this are
huge and a lot of people have inflammatory conditions or they might
have poison ivy and um what happens as soon as they
start taking this let's say for example they get poison
ivy every year or whatever and now over time it works less and less and
less to the point where it doesn't work anymore
and so now they're in a between a rock and a hard place so
i want to give you a natural prednisone alternative so this protocol would be
uh to some severe inflammatory reaction whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
poison ivy or whatever what you have to know is that cortisol
is made by your adrenal cortex outside of the adrenals you have two adrenals
top of the kidney cortisol is the natural anti-inflammatory in the body
it suppresses the immune system and this is why when someone is injected with a
steroid they feel less pain and less
inflammation but it comes with a big package a lot of destruction
to that area of the body so for example if you had
arthritis in the joint and you got injected
over and over and over with steroid eventually you are going to destroy the
joint because of the side effects and you're also getting rid of the natural
healing process so here's an alternative in order to make
cortisol you need the cofactor vitamin b5
you need vitamin c and there's also receptors
for vitamin d in the adrenal in other words vitamin d
contributes to the enhancement of cortisol
and helping it work better so if you have cortisol resistance
which is basically a situation where you have cortisol that's really really high
and then now uh the receptors have downgraded and now it doesn't work
anymore vitamin d can greatly help you kind of
reset that so this is the protocol i would
recommend for an intense inflammatory reaction let's just use
poison ivy for example so let's say you just
you're exposed now you have itching all over your body
what would you do i would recommend taking vitamin b5
500 milligrams vitamin c buffered yes this is synthetic i would get the
non-gmo version now 1000 milligrams i normally do not
recommend this but as an anti-inflammatory short-term
purpose i would recommend it okay and then vitamin d
10,000 IUs this combination right here i would take this every 15 minutes
for two hours just to chill everything out
then i would take this combination every two hours for the rest of the day
and then after that if needed take this protocol twice a day until things are
chilled out so this is just a way of naturally
calming things down as you do things to kind of correct it
like get yourself on keto intermittent
fasting to build up your immune system so i just wanted to give you something
as an alternative to this right here especially if this
doesn't work anymore and you're stuck between a rock and a
hard place and of course just check with your doctor
before taking these recommendations thanks for watching before you go if you
have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a
debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the US

but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

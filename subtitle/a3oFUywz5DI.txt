hey guys had another question from someone does ketosis increase or decrease the risk
of heart disease okay let's talk about that the study that I'm going to post down below is very
very interesting because they compared the study from rodents versus humans okay I'm going to talk
about what they found when they put people on a ketogenic diet which is basically is more fat
but the carbs are way down in rodents it increased cholesterol increases the LDL that so called bad
cholesterol it decreases the good cholesterol HDL and it increases the triglycerides okay
that's interesting but in humans it decreases cholesterol decreases the LDL increases the HDL
and decreases the triglyceride fascinating so right there this tells me that the inflammation
and problems in the arteries are not an issue okay now let's talk about even the pancreas
and rodents it will increase insulin in humans it decreases insulin decreases your blood sugar and
decreases a1c why because the main cause of heart disease is high insulin and the ketogenic diet is
designed to lower insulin one little thing I want to add make sure you add intermittent fasting to
then take it to the next level because that will also help your lower insulin even more and really
make these numbers look really good alright thanks for watching hey you probably already

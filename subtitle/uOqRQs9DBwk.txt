can taking mct oil actually help you burn more fat let's answer that question what is mct oil
well it's medium chain triglycerides it's a type of fat that can come from various things coconuts
palm oil there's even medium chain triglycerides in butter but you can actually just buy mct oil
which is concentrated mct oil what's unique about it is that it bypasses the gallbladder and bile
and enzymes so you take it goes into your stomach it goes through the small intestine and it gets
absorbed in the small intestine into the lymphatic system and it's then transported right to the
liver which is converted to ketones okay fairly quick now mct oil is not normally stored as fat
potentially you could store some if you took enough of it but not normally it's used as energy
mct oil can suppress fat accumulation it can also increase your metabolism compared to other
fats and it will not make your liver fat so can it help you actually burn more fat not
directly but indirectly yes why because mct oil allows you to fast longer so if you just started
intermittent fasting and you have a hard time going from one meal to the next like three and
a half hours and you start taking mct oil and you're able to skip a breakfast or skip a snack
and you can fast longer that's going to help you lose more weight because you are not eating
so frequently and that's going to keep insulin low also in addition to that mct oil suppresses
hunger so you're not going to snack as often so yes it can help you burn more fat but indirectly

hi guys in this video we're gonna talk about how chronic stress literally
destroys your immune system and this is very interesting I'm taking this little
section out of this book right here Ciba collection of medical
illustrations endocrine system and selected metabolic diseases by Frank
netter MD page 84 under the section on cortisol okay he's talking about the
function of cortisol and what happens if you have too much cortisol which is
activated by stress so I wrote down the board exactly what it says diverts amino
acids from lymphoid tissue leading to a marked reduction in size and to actual
lysis of the notes now let me explain what this means
so lymphoid tissue is your lymphatic system you have lymph nodes and the
lymphatic system is you can look at it like an extension of your circulatory
system where you have the heart that pumps the blood and so part of that
blood gets absorbed in the tissues and turns into lymph that then goes to
what's called a lymphatic system now you don't have a pump to push this system so
you want to look at it like a drainage system and so all this Limp comes up to
the body and it gets dumped back into the vascular system without this system
you could have a lot of edema in the tissues but it also is an area where you
have a lot of immune reactions to keep these pathogens away from different
organs so this is why your glands might swell up and they help protect you so
that's what the lymphoid tissue is leading to a mark that means noticeable
or prominent reduction in the size and to actual lysis which means breakdown of
the notes we're talking about the lymph nodes and lymph nodes are the location
of where the immune reaction takes place so you have the white blood cells in
there and you also have the pathogen so high cortisol will divert amino acids
from the lymphatic system leading to a noticeable reduction in size to actual
breakdown of the lymph nodes so basically it shrinks your lymphatic
now this is not good because now you're gonna lose your defense mechanism it's
making your immune system smaller next one says this this is accompanied by a
marked in this context we're talking about something that is distinctive and
emphasized okay so by a marked decrease in overall antibody production now
antibodies are those things that are produced by your immune system that
helps develop immunity antibodies don't necessarily kill but they actually put a
tag or a little indicator on the pathogen for other immune cells to kill
them so he have enough analyzing your system you are protected but with high
cortisol you have a decrease in overall antibody production which together with
a breakdown in inter and intracellular that means between the cells and within
the cells okay and we're talking about barriers so you have various barriers of
immune defense in this case high cortisol creates a break down in your
cellular barriers which is going to raise your susceptibility to viral and
bacterial infections so I just want to emphasize this very important factor in
keeping your immune system strong it's not just about nutrition it's also about
keeping your stress as low as possible so if you haven't seen my video on how
to do that I put it right here check it out

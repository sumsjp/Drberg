hey i'm back with a redo of a past video i did because there was an error in it and the topic
is this if you take a vitamin b6 in the wrong form the wrong type it has the potential to cause
vitamin b6 deficiency symptoms so vitamin b6 is supposed to prevent these but taking the wrong
form can actually cause these symptoms so what is the wrong form well pyridoxine hydrochloride okay
now in the past video i left out this part right here if you're taking pyridoxine from a natural
source let's say it's from a food source or nutritional yeast that's not fortified with some
other synthetic vitamin this is a natural source so really has everything to do with the source
because this version comes from petroleum esters hydrochloric acid and formaldehyde
okay so you want to avoid that so this is a no but these are a yes depending on if the source of this
is from a natural source you also have a few others pyrodoxyl phosphate and pyridoxal 5
phosphate these are all good as well and it's not even necessarily the amounts of this that you take
it's the type of b6 taking the wrong type can set you up for a deficiency of the actual
thing you're trying to correct normally b6 helps you control cortisol that's why
it helps reduce stress also vitamin b6 helps make serotonin the hormone that gives you a sense of
well-being it's an anti-depression anti-anxiety hormone also b6 is involved in turning amino acids
into glucose through this process called gluconeogenesis making new sugars out of
non-carbohydrate sources so if you can't do that then you're going to constantly have a blood sugar
issue and that can create these symptoms just from that alone so how do you become deficient in b6
by taking the wrong source synthetic version drinking alcohol can create a b6 deficiency
stress can do it having inflammation birth control pills having malabsorption there's a gut issue you
can't absorb it and certain genetic problems like what's called polymorphism where you have
this defect in your gene that won't allow you to absorb it that could be another factor all right

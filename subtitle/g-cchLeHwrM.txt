so today i want to cover all the different effects that fasting can
create on your body i've done a lot of videos
but i wanted to create one video especially for someone new to fasting so
you can see how powerful fasting is for the entire
body so let's start with your brain the first thing that fasting
will help you with is it will help you stimulate something called bdnf
brain derived neurotrophic factor you can look at this as
miracle grove for the brain it basically helps to repair
and regenerate neurons yeah you would think if you stopped eating
your brain cells would die no they thrive increasing stress
resistance so your brain becomes resistant to
stress so it can handle more stress interesting increased
neurogenesis which actually is part of this right
here so you're generating the growth of more
neurons and nerve cells and nerve support cells
especially if there's damage if you have alzheimer's
parkinson's this is very very important then we have the production of more
mitochondria mitochondria is the energy factories in
all the cells including your brain so if these guys
work right here you're going to have memory you're going
to be able to focus you're going to have better cognitive function
fasting helps improve the number of mitochondria in the brain also
decreases inflammation and i don't even need to get into that
because i think most people understand how deadly inflammation is on the
different parts of the body but there's probably nothing more
powerful than fasting to handle inflammation
okay there's more things that fasting will do but i think that's a good
summary now the liver the first thing that
fasting will help you with is making insulin more
sensitive which is going to help blood sugars
pre-diabetes diabetes most people have insulin
resistance and so insulin doesn't work that well
fasting helps make insulin work so your blood sugars
are going to do better your absorption of nutrients are going
to do better also fasting helps in the detoxification process
both detoxification of the phase one phase two enzymes to take poisonous
chemicals and turn them into water-soluble harmless particles
as well as stimulating something called autophagy
which is your cells recycling mechanism to take
damaged cells and make them new again fasting helps increase your antioxidant
network also fasting is amazing to reduce a fatty liver to take the fat in
the liver and use that for energy and clear out
the fat on the liver thereby increasing the function of the
liver in the detoxification of hormones its metabolism of food in the storage of
vitamins in the production of bile the list goes
on and on and on fasting helps decrease inflammation in
the liver as well as in conditions like hepatitis
if you're going to decrease inflammation you're also going to decrease
fibrosis that's scar tissue and fibrosis turns into cirrhosis and then we get to
the gut okay we're talking about the small
intestine and the large intestine fasting increases the diversity of
microbes in your gut apparently that stress causes
this survival mechanism of different types of microbes growing which is
fascinating fasting decreases inflammation in the
gut and there's a lot of conditions that involve inflammation also it
decreases sibo very very important i'll put a link
down below for more information on that if you haven't
heard that uh video also it fasting helps
make your microbiome your friendly bacteria live
longer okay then let's talk about the immune systems
huge effects fasting will actually help you become immune to pathogens
because the white blood cells increase in strength and size
and in their weaponry to kill off pathogens
periodic prolonged fasting like 72 hours can increase
stem cells in your immune system so you're basically growing
a new immune system now the fasting effect on the pancreas
is huge because if you think about it when
you're eating you're constantly triggering
insulin all the time especially when you're snacking
so that's creating damage in little cells that make insulin it's in the
pancreas well when you fast you reverse the flow
and you give the cells that make insulin a
chance to heal and rejuvenate so you start to develop insulin
sensitivity insulin starts working better that's why if you're pre-diabetic
if you're a diabetic it's essential that you do intermittent
fasting fasting is going to help your blood
sugars then we get to the fat cell fasting stimulates lipolysis basically
the breakdown of fat okay so we get rid of the fat cells if
they're too big if they're too stuffed they reduce in size
and you start generating ketones so you turn this into ketones which can be used
for energy your brain loves ketones you get more
energy from ketones you improve the insulin resistance
situation so if you're resistant to insulin that
condition improves in fact fasting is the thing
that creates a faster metabolism which is
very different than starving or some low-calorie
diet i'll put a link down below for more information on that because i just did a
video on that very interesting okay leptin it
decreases leptin so you're going to find that the the
messages for hunger are going to go way down
also it reduces inflammation which is going to help you
in correcting insulin resistance okay let's talk about the muscles the
first thing that's going to happen is insulin is going to become more
sensitive so it's going to work better so because
insulin is anabolic which means you're going to
actually be able to build up your muscles the more insulin
works you're also going to get protein sparing
so when you fast the muscles go into a certain state
where they stop breaking down okay so it's going to help you
prevent protein loss from your muscles also increasing stress resistance so
your body just becomes overall stronger and more fit to survive
then we get to the heart muscle we increase
more parasympathetic now parasympathetic is the opposite of sympathetic which is
flutter fight stress mode so this is relaxation mode
when people do fasting they feel calm their heart relaxes
they're able to rest and digest better also the heart rate comes down and
there's an increase in something called heart
rate variability normally you have these heartbeats that are supposed to be
on average i'd say 72 beats per hour right
well you would think in a healthy heart you need the same amount of time for
each beat but that's not the case the healthier
the heart the more erratic or the more variable
the heartbeat should be because variability helps you in the
adaptation of certain things and it's less
rigid so there's a test that you can do i used to do it in my office that
measures this and people with a very healthy heart
would have a very high hiv and they would be able to
handle a lot of stress because they have more parasympathetic
and they have a huge recovery backup system the more
rigid the heart is the stiffer the arteries
the less variance you have between the heartbeats itself
okay less blood pressure because things are more elastic
and increased stress resistance so the heart becomes stronger
to fight stress so in summary you can see that fasting creates
some very cool effects and i didn't get into the anti-cancer effects
and there's many other effects but at least this will convince you
to try fasting yourself thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up
watch the recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy
making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

hey guys today we're gonna talk about the best vegetable for gastritis can you
guess what it is cabbage let's talk about why that is
right after I get done telling you what gastritis is so it's an inflamed stomach
it's not a little thing it's a major major problem for your stomach to become
inflamed it takes years sometimes it could take less than that but usually
it's a chronic problem after taking aspirin for many many years for some
other problem or you took steroids or your diet has been really bad or you be
taking antacids chronically that left you with now and inflamed stomach you may or
may not have an ulcer but the lining of the stomach is inflamed and it's very
sensitive so if you were to dump a lot of acid into your stomach it may cause a
lot of pain the main symptom for gastritis is upper central abdominal
pain you have pain right here it could be gnawing dull burning and I used to
have this in college of course I chronically was under massive stress
very little sleep lots of sugar and refined carbs and junk food not to
mention a ton of coffee and you're probably also gonna have bloating now
there's some other triggers for gastritis one would be H pylori that
infection destroys the mucous lining in the side of the stomach that mucous
lining is very very important to prevent acid from eroding and irritating the
inner stomach also H pylori is going to destroy the acid making cells and so the
pH of your stomach is going to go higher and higher and more alkaline and that's
going to make it really hard to digest protein and kill microbes so you're
gonna be very susceptible to having other infections getting food poisoning
for example let's say you had some chicken that wasn't thoroughly cooked
and then you get this bacteria now there's also a factor in your stomach
the intrinsic factor that allows you to absorb b12 so without the stomach acid
you're gonna not have enough intrinsic factor and then you're gonna get anemia
not to mention a whole list of b12 deficiencies it just so happens that the
remedy for gastritis is the same for h pylori you want to consume food high in
sulforaphane and that would be cabbage or broccoli sprouts or a combination of
both of them but cabbage also has other phytonutrients that greatly help in
reducing inflammation because they're anti-inflammatory not to mention it's
loaded with vitamin C which actually cleans up a lot of the free radical
damage that's coming from all the inflammation
now the cabbage could be in a juice form it could be in a coleslaw you may be
able to do a sauerkraut but it's interesting that other vegetables will
cause a lot of cramping but a person with gastritis can pretty much tolerate
cabbage pretty well your diet in general if you have gastritis is crucial you
just can't be on any diet need any food you have to be very selective the food
has to be very high quality you cannot do any junk and you need to be doing
intermittent fasting hardcore because you want to let your stomach and
intestinal tract have a chance to not be exposed to food so it can heal and so I
would highly recommend that as well there's some other things you can do to
inhibit this microbe if you have this infection that would be mastic gum you
can get it as a supplement it works pretty well now normally in your body
most people have this microbe and it doesn't create any problems it only
comes out of remission becomes a problem if the environment is very unhealthy so
as long as you start eating healthily and you keep your stress low this should
stay into remission but my recommendation and this is just my
opinion is that you don't try to kill this off because everything that you're
going to use to kill that off talking about antibiotics is going to come with
a package it's going to create side-effects and then you may become
antibiotic resistant and now you have a whole other series of
problems that you have to deal with all we want to do is put this microbe in
remission so it doesn't bother you and check with your doctor before taking any
of these recommendations this is just my opinion so that being said there's some
other things to do one is a probiotic probiotics inhibit h
pylori and they also reduce inflammation you want to get a good one a liquid
probiotic that doesn't get destroyed by the acidity of the stomach would be a
good idea you can also chew on raw black seeds to help reduce some of the pain
let's say an hour before the meal lastly zinc carnosine is one of the best things
for not just gastritis but any type of ulcer you have in your body so this is
definitely a very important thing right here now you may also think you have
SIBO and you may have SIBO small intestinal bacterial overgrowth that's a
situation we have the microbes it should be in the large intestine but they're in
the small intestine where they shouldn't be so if you're doing cabbage or any
type of vegetables or even probiotic it's going to feed the microbes in the
wrong place and you're going to get more bloating now in other videos I tell
people to do a carnivore diet okay if they have SIBO the problem is is if you
have this infection right here and you have a low stomach acid and you're
consuming a lot of meat protein without the hydrochloric acid to break it down
it's not going to work there are several pieces to this puzzle that you want to
look at and I would first start with the cabbage okay and some broccoli sprouts
and realize gastritis takes months to heal because it's a major major problem
and as you plant this information this thing will go back in remission the
stomach will slowly slowly heal to the point where you don't have it then you
can start to acidify the stomach with apple cider vinegar betaine
hydrochloride but if you took it now you may create more inflammation of your
stomach so that's your plan for addressing gastritis thanks for watching

you know you go to the gym and you watch these people doing all sorts of
sit-ups abdominal exercises week after week
and no change in their midsection today i want to talk about why abdominal exercises will not work
in reducing your belly fat now this study that i just read which i'm going to put a link down
below showed that abdominal exercises produced no significant effect on weight body fat percentage
abdominal circumference abdominal skin fold or abdominal subcutaneous fat loss subcutaneous fat
is the superficial fat right underneath your skin but on a positive note what it did do
is increase the person's overall endurance so they can do these exercises longer okay that's cool
but what about your belly well there are three things going on you have this superficial
fat underneath your skin that's the subcutaneous fat and then you have the fat that's on your liver
the first thing that happens is the liver fills up with fat and then it spills over fat in and around
the organs in the abdomen and so all three situations subcutaneous visceral fat and liver
fat come from the same thing too much insulin and that occurs because the person's consuming
too many carbs so the question is does abdominal exercises reduce insulin and the answer is no
it doesn't and this is why people are not getting results and so if you're new to my channel and you
haven't watched a lot of videos there's several things that you can do to create a huge change
in your midsection in fact eighty percent of your results in changing the shape of your stomach and
shrinking it has to do with not exercise but your diet you simply need to reduce your carbs
get unhealthy keto i put a link down below of how to do that and you definitely need to start
doing intermittent fasting okay the combination of those two will produce the majority of results in
your midsection and then you can definitely add exercise as well but not just abdominal
exercises you would want to do high intensity interval training and that definitely will help
but only about 15 all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

hey i'm back with a video on b1 deficiency now i've done all the videos talking about b1 thymine
related to a lot of different things this one is about b1 deficiency after you take antibiotics now
before i begin i'm filming on zoom with a mic that makes me sound like i have a cold which i don't
the camera makes my nose look bigger and my head bigger and my body's smaller so
no i didn't lose weight it's just a new camera and a new mic for the location that i'm in okay
so let's talk about b1 deficiency after antibiotics now there's quite a few different
antibiotics that can create a b1 deficiency cipro i listed a bunch of other ones the penicillins
the sulfa antibiotics and there's quite a few others in fact there's over 60 generic versions
also in this list now what you have to realize is vitamin b1 comes from your diet but it also
comes from your microbes and as you kill them off with taking an antibiotic you can end up with a
b1 deficiency and other deficiencies as well here are some of the symptoms ADD
anxiety agitation nervousness lack of memory in some cases severe hypoglycemia
even to the point where you can actually go into a coma tendinitis and check this out tendon rupture
now why in the heck would someone get a tendon rupture after taking an antibiotic and what's
the relationship to vitamin b1 well vitamin b1 doesn't just deal with carbohydrate metabolism
it deals with amino acid metabolism as well and if you're deficient in b1 you're not going to
be able to transport certain branch amino acids to make your collagen so it can set you up with
all sorts of weaknesses within the collagen formation there's also an enhanced warning
disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons muscles joints and nerves and
this is displayed on the paperwork when they give you this antibiotic also it can create
irreversible peripheral neuropathy so if you're in a situation where you have to take an antibiotic
i would highly recommend you not only take a probiotic at the same time but also take your
b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast so this video is just about increasing your awareness
on another reason why you might end up with a b1 deficiency before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

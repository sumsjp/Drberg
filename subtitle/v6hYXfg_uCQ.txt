we're going to talk about the best way to get off sugar now the question is why is it so
hard to give up sugar well the simple answer is because you're doing it without your body's help
when you try to give up sugar on top of body cravings it takes a tremendous amount of willpower
and self-discipline you're completely going uphill and it's just a matter of time before you start
caving in and then going back to sugar but what if you were completely able to give up
your addictions i'm sorry your cravings once and for all wouldn't that be a lot easier
yes it really is because what you're dealing with when you're craving sugar and you're giving
in the sugar is you're really dealing with this this spike in this one neurotransmitter called
dopamine dopamine gives you pleasure for about i don't know 90 seconds to two minutes and then
that's followed up with a big spike in cortisol and then you're going to feel stressed personally
if i ate i don't know about 30 grams of sugar right now i'd feel like crap i'm gonna feel
lethargic for at least 20 to 30 minutes if not an hour to two hours i just wouldn't feel quite right
i'd start feeling irritable and grouchy my vision would be off i would have brain fog
i would have terrible concentration and i would actually have more sugar cravings
but i think people are used to it and they really don't even know how good they can feel once they
come off sugar but here's the recommendation on the correct way to get off sugar number one
don't do it gradually but don't postpone the misery when you do it gradually you're still
having sugar cravings during this process so some people try to give up their sugar cravings within
i don't know one to two to three weeks during the entire time they have sugar cravings i
mean why not just do it within two days and you're done because once you adapt to ketones
you no longer have cravings they're gone and also there's no such thing as a sugar detox you're not
detoxifying when you're getting off sugar toxins are not coming out sugar is being burned up
but what you're feeling is this transition period on your brain your brain simply just does not have
the fuel it's not toxins it just doesn't have the fuel because you haven't converted over to ketones
quite yet there's a very simple solution and that is to start taking ketones in the form of mct oil
so mct oil converts quickly to ketones it feeds your brain it makes your brain feel happy and
you won't have that bad feeling but you want to get off sugar very quick very simply start
consuming two meals one at lunch and one at dinner no snacks and just to keep this simple just make
sure your carbs are less than 30 grams per day not per meal but per day what's going to happen
is because you're depriving your body of sugar your body is going to start converting over to
ketosis and your body's going to start to use this other fuel source and you're going to start
feeling better but the biggest thing you're going to notice is that your hunger is going to go away
and your cravings are going to go away and it's not going to take a long time to have that happen
you're looking at about two days and then the process you're taking this mct oil just to make
it a lot easier anyway i wanted to create this video on those of you that are still eating sugar

now if you have a cold feet you don't want to forget about iodine i've done several other
videos on this topic there's other causes of cold feet but an iodine deficiency is definitely
one of them let's take a deeper look at an iodine deficiency to kind of observe some of the symptoms
that can occur number one a slower metabolic rate your metabolism is dependent on iodine why
because iodine is part of the thyroid system and without iodine your thyroid cannot work the
thyroid innervates every single mitochondria that's the energy factory of your cells
so without iodine you have a slow metabolism you're going to be tired
you're going to be weak you're going to have hair loss possibly dry skin
but definitely you're going to get cold trouble learning is connected to low iodine especially
in a child a lower iq is also associated with an iodine deficiency especially if the mother
who's carrying a child is deficient in iodine a child's mental capacity is definitely related
to iodine and it's very important for a woman who's pregnant to get enough iodine problem is
trying to get enough iodine from food because the soils are so depleted so unless you're consuming
food from the sea or sea kelp or you're taking an iodine supplement or a trace mineral supplement
you may not get enough so it's a very important thing that child will also have trouble learning
if they're deficient in iodine and iodine does a lot of other things but one thing it definitely
will do as well is help buffer excessive amounts of estrogen so if there's an estrogen dominant
situation iodine can help to regulate that and this is why it's really beneficial for
something like ovarian cyst or a fibrocystic breast where a female has too much estrogen
the iodine can actually help to bring that down to a normal level and just so you know globally
there's 1572 million people on this planet who are at risk for having an iodine deficiency
and again iodine is not just for the thyroid it actually is involved in a lot of other things
but let's actually talk about a good source of iodine seek help what's so special about seacal
well number one it's very high in iodine it's a good source it's a plant-based source but it has a
lot of other things as well it has high levels of manganese which is a trace mineral that has a good
amount of iron which is another common deficiency in children in certain parts of the world it has
a good amount of zinc it has a good amount of selenium it has a good amount of potassium and
magnesium and even calcium it also has vanadium which is an interesting trace mineral vanadium
in animal studies can act like estrogen so it's really good for blood sugars and then we have
another natural chemical called fucoidin which has anti-cancer properties as well as anti-tumor
properties which is interesting and then there's a pigment in sea kelp called fucoxanthin
which can help you lose weight and then we have something called alginate which is a fiber which
has the capacity to inhibit the absorption of certain fats that apparently helps people
lose weight but again this is not going to be the weight loss secret if your diet is high in carbs
so if you're new to my channel click down below to learn more about keto but getting back to cold
feet if you want to use sea kelp to help that condition you'd want to take not large amounts
just like one capsule of sea kelp in the early morning
not right before you go to bed because it generally will wake you up and give you energy
and you want to take that for two to three weeks because sometimes it takes a while to kick in but
if your problem is in iodine deficiency and you have some of these items right here it just may
be the thing to warm you up hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

now i've talked about this topic uh i think two years ago at my summit
it may be in other videos but i wanted to create one video just on this one topic because
it's actually very very important i think you're going to find it very very interesting but folate
vitamin b9 deficiency has the potential to cause dna damage which can then lead to cancer when you
go to the hospital to get an x-ray do you have any concern about getting x-rays or a cat scan do
you mind them taking an x-ray does it bother you and if the answer is yes then the question is why
why are you concerned about getting x-rays well probably because it has radiation correct did you
realize that a folate deficiency creates the same damage as ionizing radiation from x-rays
yes there's an interesting story about this by professor bruce ames i put a link down
below for that but folate is a vitamin that is a coenzyme so it's a helper enzyme specifically to
help you make rna in dna so rna is a copy of dna and dna is the blueprints that are in your cells
that are the instructions to make the entire body so when a person is deficient in folate not
only are you going to get all sorts of dna breaks and damage but it's also going to impair the dna
repair process which can then lead to cancer now here we have the dna the blueprints of your body
these blueprints actually are the building blocks for your entire all your body tissue now what
we're looking at is these blueprints going through this amazing machine you have this machine that
is like a zipper and it's unzipping these two little strands that are connected called dna
and and this zipper is spinning at a speed that's equivalent to a jet
engine and what's happening here is your dna is being copied in a very interesting way
one strand is going one way but it's not just copying a piece of paper it's copying something
in three dimensions fascinating and on top of everything else
you have several layers of error correction or proofreading going on so it's kind of like this
little program that will scan the code to look for errors and it's extremely accurate and if there is
an air another unit will come in there and fix it so there's several types of errors that can happen
and sometimes it'll have to cut out a section and replace it
and other times they can just manipulate the code a little bit to make sure it's exact so as
you can see this dna repair mechanism is simply awesome and just by a simple vitamin deficiency
like a folate deficiency you're going to create massive errors in this mechanism and these errors
can lead to all sorts of diseases so i hope this demonstration gave you a little more motivation to
eat healthier hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

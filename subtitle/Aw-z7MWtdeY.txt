the absolute best herb that you could
take for liver disease okay is this herb
called milk thistle now when i'm talking
about liver disease i'm talking about
three things fatty liver
cirrhosis which is scar tissue
and
an inflamed liver it's called hepatitis
okay
and when we talk about a fatty liver i'm
talking about
both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
as well as alcoholic fatty liver disease
and by the way as a side note if you
look at the difference between the
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and an
alcoholic fatty liver disease i mean
it's almost identical so that's actually
amazing that there's some non-alcoholic
reasons why the liver gets fatty and
that all relates to one thing
insulin resistance there's always this
insulin resistance in this non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease okay and that
involves too much insulin which comes
from too much sugar too much refined
carbohydrates and definitely with
fructose as in high fructose corn syrup
unfortunately more and more children
are developing a fatty liver in fact one
out of 10 kids has a fatty liver and out
of that 10 percent 17
are developing scar tissue because what
happens you go through this evolution
you have
fatty liver okay or an inflamed liver
that then turns into scar tissue which
is eventually going to turn into
cirrhosis which is the advanced form of
late end stage liver disease which is
irreversible there's a point of no
return and the other important thing you
need to know about the liver is there's
not a lot of symptoms
with liver damage okay until it becomes
very very end stage okay so by the time
you know you have damage a lot of times
it's too late one way to know that the
liver is
developing fat is just to look down at
your shoes right now and if you can't
see your shoes because your belly is
sticking out we know you have a fatty
liver
when the liver becomes fatty
it then spills over
into spaces around the liver cells as
well as around the liver itself so you
have what's called visceral fat which is
fat around the organs
as well as inside the organs too but
ectopic fat is the fat that accumulates
outside the fat cell and it just kind of
spreads over because there's no more
space but regardless of what kind of
liver problem you have
this is a really good remedy okay milk
thistle the group of compounds in milk
thistle that's producing all these
wonderful effects is called silimarin
it's kind of a collective group of
similar compounds that really can help
your liver number one
and this is the biggest effect it can
actually
protect you
against
poisons i mean medications actually
poisons too but and medications are a
poison to your liver
but things like tylenol things like
ssris in fact if you are on a medication
i highly recommend that you also at the
same time take milk thistle to protect
you against the damage also if you're on
chemotherapy i highly recommend you take
this herb the majority of silly marin is
in the seed okay in the seed of this
weed okay
this is what it looks like and what you
do if you wanted to harvest your own
which i recommend because it's very very
inexpensive this prickery weed is
probably in your backyard right now or
in a field that you can wait until a
certain time where this flower
turns kind of white and there's a two
week window where you can actually
capture the seeds but this plant is
basically going to allow the wind to
spread its seeds and regrow so what you
do is you wear gloves you take the top
part of this plant off okay it's going
to be like a white little bushy thing
with a bunch of seeds and you're going
to hang it upside down and shake it into
a bag or a bowl and you're going to
separate out these little things that
are attached to it they look like little
parachutes okay and you get the seeds
and you can then grind them up in a
coffee grinder and put them on your
salad you can also put them in a shake
okay let's say you have a blueberry and
a kale shake with maybe a little kefir
you can consume them in many different
ways but milk thistle is quite amazing
it protects you against poisons
including medications it can protect you
against poisonous mushrooms it can
protect you against snake bites as in
poisonous snake bites it can protect you
against alcohol so it can do a lot for
you it also has the capacity to decrease
fat on your liver as well as help you
regenerate liver cells
it decreases liver enzymes which are an
indication that there's liver
and it does all this through increasing
two very powerful antioxidants one is
sod and the other is glutathione okay so
they're antioxidants
the other thing that this herb will do
relates to blood sugars it helps to
regulate blood sugars by lowering
insulin and glucose and improving
insulin resistance and as a side note to
that that may or may not be related
it's also very very good for depression
and milk thistle can also reduce
inflammation especially hepatitis c

liver

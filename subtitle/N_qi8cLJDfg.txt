there's a very important um
misconception out there regarding
carbohydrates okay
i want to clear this up because you'll
see this
in various articles and different books
and this is what they say carbs are the
body's most important
source of fuel okay they'll say that
glucose is the most important source of
energy in the body now what does that
mean most important
source of energy does that mean it's the
healthiest source of energy
i guess the question is i need
clarification and what they mean by
most important okay because the more
important question is this
what fuel source gives the body the most
health sometimes they'll um they'll say
that the brain
is dependent on glucose as a major
energy
source and then in the next sentence
they'll say ketones are an
alternative source of energy usually
used when you're starving
and so they kind of put ketones in a
negative light like they're an
alternative fuel source
or you only make ketones when you're
starving they won't
usually mention fasting or intermittent
fasting sounds pretty dangerous
they might also add in their
ketoacidosis
a very rare condition for type 1
diabetics where you're
you're not using insulin and your
ketones are off the chart
to make it sound that ketones are very
very dangerous then you have the usda
guidelines
which recommend that 65 of all your
calories
should be carbohydrates so then we know
that if they recommend it it must be
true and also say that your body likes
to eat carbs because
they're the first line of energy the
body will always burn the carbs first
before other energy sources like fat
or ketones so here's the question i have
if this is actually true that our bodies
were designed to live on glucose
mainly as it's very important fuel
source
and other fuel sources are not natural
they're alternative and they're used as
a backup
why do we have such a massive problem
with diabetes in the world diabetes is a
situation where
they have dysfunctional insulin so they
can't regulate
glucose so insulin is either
dysfunctional
or there's not enough insulin to take
the glucose out of the blood because
it's either
not there or it's insufficient in some
manner
so now we have this higher level of
glucose
in the blood and both of these
conditions occur
when you have high levels of glucose or
carbs
in the diet so if our bodies like
carbohydrates
why is everyone becoming a diabetic and
why is it
that so many health problems clear up
when you switch fuel sources
from carbohydrates or glucose
to fat and ketones i'm talking about
a fatty liver i'm talking about diabetes
i'm talking about insulin resistance i'm
talking about
mood disorders anxiety depression
cognitive disorders dementia better
focus
better concentration i'm talking about
other conditions
related to your hormones like pcos
polycystic ovarian syndrome
why does someone's cholesterol do better
when they switch fuel sources
why does a person's triglycerides come
down
why does a person with bad heart
problems actually get better
when they get in a ketogenic diet now if
you take a look at what
a normal blood sugar is it should be
right around 80 right
i mean what does that mean 80 milligrams
per deciliter
that's basically one little teaspoon of
sugar
in all of your blood now if our bodies
were meant to consume
65 of the calories carbohydrates which
is basically
a cup and a half of sugar how can a
person's blood sugar show
normal like 80 if they're consuming all
the sugar well because
the insulin is coming in there and very
rapidly taking the sugar
out of the blood and putting it as
storage to keep that
normal blood sugars and so when many
people go to the doctor their
blood sugar is normal despite consuming
a massive amount of sugar
simply because the doctors rarely test
insulin levels they're mainly focused on
glucose
levels if they were to also test the
insulin level
they would find a huge massive spike
in insulin that's called hyper insulin
anemia in that condition
high levels of insulin is brewing in the
oven
for probably 10 to 15 to 20 years
before the person even gets a
pre-diabetic situation
or a diabetic situation so i just want
to do this video
to show you this very important
distinction
on what fuel source the body really
naturally was designed to run on
it's not glucose it's ketones if you're
new to my channel
check out the link down below of exactly
what you need to be eating
hey before you go if you're benefiting
from
any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please

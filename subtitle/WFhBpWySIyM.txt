today we're going to talk about how to
cure the silent killer hepatitis
for only a thousand dollars per pill now
the catches you have to take this for
roughly about three months and roughly
there's a little more than 90 days in
three months so that comes out to 90 000
now before i get into the cure let's
talk about what hepatitis is it's
inflammation of the liver we're
primarily going to be discussing uh
viral hepatitis okay but there's also
other causes of hepatitis like an
autoimmune which can be triggered by
various things it could be triggered by
a virus a vaccine
some drug or other things but there's a
lot of people who have hepatitis like
325 million people worldwide have
hepatitis and the problem is there's not
a lot of clues or symptoms
to give it away that's why they called a
silent killer because you don't know
what's going on so what's happening is
the virus ghosts your immune system
which means it hides within our immune
system below the radar so it can't be
detected and at the same time it hijacks
our own immune system so our immune
system's antiviral tree cannot be
activated so it paralyzes our immune
system so we can't fight back while it
creates a lot of destruction
and over time that viral destruction
then turns into inflammation and
possibly into fibrosis
so
the cure
it's a drug called solvaldy now they do
use other medications with this
medication
but cevalde has a pretty high success
rate for hepatitis type c and the
definition for successfully treated
apparently means curing and so the cure
rate or successful treatment
is roughly between
80 to 86 percent now the problem with
this drug number one is the cost it's a
thousand dollars per pill and a person
could spend anywhere between
eighty thousand
to a hundred and sixty thousand dollars
for a round of treatment now the
question i have is why is it so darn
expensive well the reply is the r d it
takes a lot of money to develop this
drug but there's a very interesting
paper i'm going to put in the
description that talks about
the funding that they get in their r d
but apparently this drug got over 60
million dollars
in awards okay both direct and indirect
awards
now where does the government get their
money from taxpayers like you
so you pay for a lot of this drug
research on the front end
as well as the back end
it's very similar to me opening up a
mcdonald's franchise where i get you
to pay for this for all the initial cost
right
and then i get you as a customer you
come in there and you pay for the
product
so you end up paying at the front end
and the back end lots of people aren't
aware of that it's the government that's
paying for a lot of this big pharma r d
which i really think there should be a
law that they have to pay us back
but anyway
what i did is i dug into some real
interesting
patents
on using herbal remedies for hepatitis
that i'd like to share with you there's
three three main patents
the first one involved wormwood extract
coax root
and red sage root and they claim to have
a pretty high cure rate
95 for hepatitis type a and 90 for
hepatitis type b
apparently this blend of herbs was a
secret prescription which is handed down
in a certain family from generation to
generation well when you apply for a
patent you have to reveal the
combination of herbs so i put that
information down below and the next
patent for hepatitis they used nut grass
and an herb or a weed called narghamatha
nagamotha is the world's worst
weed and it's an extremely hearty herb
that is just invasive and this is so
interesting about these weeds like milk
thistle is a weed a nettle root is a
weed and a lot of these weeds have
natural chemicals that give huge health
benefits and apparently nargomatha has
some great properties to deal with
hepatitis and again i put all these
links to the patents down in the
description now the next patent involves
milk thistle which is one of my favorite
herbs for the liver especially in
protecting the liver against
all sorts of things including toxicity
from chemotherapy toxicity from alcohol
toxicity from tylenol milk thistle helps
to decrease this
transition from inflammation to fibrosis
but this blend of herbs
as a remedy for hepatitis
includes milk thistle artichoke licorice
turmeric ginseng stinging nettle and
ginger and the recommendation is to take
it three times a day about one and a
half hours before you eat now i cannot
talk about inflammation without
mentioning vitamin d okay vitamin d3
very interesting research i'll put that
down below but a vitamin d deficiency is
associated with the pathogenesis okay of
hepatitis b
and c
viruses now what does that mean
pathogenesis it means the creation of
these diseases
so apparently when you're low in vitamin
d which a lot of people are it makes you
more susceptible to getting hepatitis
which is very important to know because
having enough vitamin d actually can
protect you against getting this virus
as well as if you have the virus it can
help minimize the damage because think
about what's happening you have this
virus that
has hijacked your immune system and
vitamin d is the most important vitamin
to help regulate your immune system
vitamin d is involved with almost every
part of your immune system including the
innate and acquired part of your immune
system and if you have hepatitis whether
it's coming from a virus or it's just
autoimmune
chances are you're going to be low in
vitamin d vitamin d also decreases the
replication of viruses so make mental
note of that and make sure you get
enough vitamin d there's another remedy
that i would take if i had hepatitis and
it would be nac
that is a precursor for glutathione it
can greatly help the oxidation and
inflammation and the collateral damage
that occurs when you have hepatitis and
i'll put that link down below too so
this video really is about giving you
more information to be able to
dig in and do research if you personally
have hepatitis and i think the most
important video for you to watch next
would be my video that i did on vitamin
d
and the immune system check it out i put
it right here

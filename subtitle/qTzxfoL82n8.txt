so today we're gonna talk about the benefits of apple cider vinegar all
right so what is apple cider vinegar basically you're taking the sugar in the
apple juice in certain microbes bacteria and yeast are turning that sugar into
alcohol then eventually into vinegar so there's a whole process that occurs and
the end product vinegar is acetic acid now there's other acids involved but
this is the main one so remember growing up in Wisconsin
where there was farms all around our neighborhood and so we had a crabapple
tree and there was a farmer on the other side of the cornfield so I brought him a
big bushel basket of crab apples and I wanted him to grind up these apples and
turn them into apple juice so he did that for me I brought him back in jugs
and I left him out in the Sun I think one or two days and they turned into
something called apple cider apple cider is basically a spiked apple juice okay
it had some alcohol in it and that basically was the start of my alcoholic
journey at eight years old and I'm completely being sarcastic so I did not
become an alcoholic at eight years old more like twenty years old no I'm just
kidding but the point is that if you take apple juice that's not pasteurized
not heated it goes through fermentation okay so with the help of microbes it
eventually turns into vinegar so there's many different types of vinegar that you
can get the one I'm gonna recommend is a raw unpasteurized version of vinegar
organic Bragg's has a really good one it also has the mother what is that that's
basically some residue of some fiber pectin
some bacteria in yeast I do not think that's going to give you a lot of health
benefits really the health benefits are the acetic acid but the fact that the AB
set of vinegar is raw means that it's going to be rich in enzymes so that
alone can actually help you in your digestion so you don't want it
pasteurized and the other thing that because it's organic means it doesn't
have the added pesticides in the chemical so Bragg's is a really good
version also the pH is between three point three and three point five if you
get distilled vinegar it's a little bit lower I think it's like two point five
but this is acid enough all right so the other thing is you
don't need to keep it in the fridge shredder you can keep it outside the
refrigerator and it'll last for like five years okay so now let's talk about
the benefits of apple cider vinegar here number one digestion it speeds up
digestion it activates enzymes so a lot of these enzymes in the stomach in the
pancreas and other places in the body are dormant and it takes certain things
to activate them and acid is one of the activators of the enzymes in the stomach
to help you break down protein so right there that's going to help speed up
digestion number two it's going to control pathogens if you think about it
you have pickles you have fermented vegetables that are in acid that acid in
there is preserving that food and preventing bacterial growth so when you
consume an acid actually lowers the pathogens in the body that helps in the
overgrowth of certain microbes especially even a condition called sibo
sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which is a condition where
you have bacteria growing in the wrong place you have all this bacteria growing
in the small intestine instead of the large intestine and so if your pH is not
strong enough in the stomach you can actually develop that condition so if
you take outside of vinegar it can help create a condition where the microbes
cannot thrive in the small intestine number three it helps you absorb
minerals like calcium magnesium and iron all need certain pH to be absorbed if
the pH in your stomach is too alkaline you're not going to absorb as many
minerals also vitamins vitamin K vitamin C and even b12 need this acid to be
absorbed all right number four it can decrease gas bloating and even
indigestion so the last thing you want is undigested food in your in your
digestive tract so apple cider vinegar just speeds up the breakdown of food so
you have more of a complete digestion one cause of gas is incomplete protein
digestion alright number five it decreases acid reflux now normally what
happens in the stomach is you have to have an acid up between one and three
very very acidic to be able to have that valve on the top close and prevent the
backup of acid that comes in your esophagus so when you lose your stomach
acid the valve doesn't close and the acid can reflux up and the term for that
is GERD and so you would take in any asset and you feel better but the next
time you eat it's worse why because you're making that acid less acid and so
over time that valve just stays open and you have a constant reflux and you're
dependent on these medications well here's the thing if you take apple cider
vinegar it helps the valve closed more improving the symptoms of acid reflux
and GERD the exact opposite thing you would think that would work but it does
work now even if you look at the side effects of taking medication for acid
reflux and GERD is GERD it's the same thing so the side effect is that you get
at more acid reflux it doesn't make sense okay so number six it helps to
release bile the bile is made in your liver and it's released from the
gallbladder and there's a certain signal from the stomach of having a certain
amount of acid that then triggers the release of the bile
so apple cider vinegar can help release the bile that's congested that's why you
probably have less bloating when you take it also the enzymes from the
pancreas can release so you have more complete digestion alright number seven
you get more of a complete breakdown with protein so the protein can then
turn into its amino acids which are the building blocks of protein and you need
a certain acid to activate the enzymes to do that okay episode of vinegar can
contribute to those acids number eight blood sugar improvement episode vinegar
can help you make glucose more sensitive so you have less insulin resistance and
thereby less insulin being produced and that can directly cause more weight loss
so when you hear these claims about episode of vinegar helping you lose
weight this is why also it's going to help you lower cholesterol why because
when you reduce insulin you lower cholesterol it's probably going to also
help with blood pressure and anything related to high levels of insulin it can
improve okay and lastly it can help your immune system it can stimulate the white
blood cells to speed up and help fight infection so as you can see there are
many benefits apple cider vinegar so go ahead and take between one and two
tablespoons outside of vinegar in some water I usually use 16 ounces I like to
put lemon juice in there as well you can use a straw so it doesn't affect your
teeth and you can take it before a meal after a meal I take mine in the evening
right about 6:00 o'clock I usually take my wheatgrass juice at powder in the
morning and I'll take this in the evening but in summary there's many
benefits to this product and if you don't like the taste you can also get it
into a tablet form and I'll put a link down below if you want to take it in a
pill form alright guys thanks for watching I'll see in the next video so

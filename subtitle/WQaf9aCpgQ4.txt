so i've had a lot of questions about this topic tattoo ink um is it okay to get a tattoo
is there any toxicity so i just wanted to create a short video to tell you my viewpoint on it
couple drawbacks number one it's not regulated by the fda so what is a tattoo well they're
injecting certain pigments into your skin uh the second layer called the dermis which is about
one half of a millimeter so it's very shallow it's not very deep but of course you don't want
to go deeper than that also you can't donate blood if you've gotten a tattoo within a year
another point is you want to make sure that if you go get a tattoo they do autoclave
sterilization because you want to make sure that the instruments they use are completely sterilized
i mean there is a small risk of infection and there's also a risk of having an
allergy to the pigment and there are certain pigments that are a bit toxic that have the
capacity to spread to your lymph nodes and some of the ingredients which i'm going to cover
in a second can be carcinogenic so i want to make you aware of that and there really is no
systematic safety studies on tattoos so if you're going to get a tattoo i would just highly suggest
that you make sure that the ink that they expose you to is non-toxic here are some of the chemicals
and things in the tattoo ink number one there could be heavy metals like mercury
lead cadmium aluminum not good to expose your body to that there could be acrylics
which is a certain chemical certain solvents plastics chemicals like bpa now all of
these are classified as a carcinogen so why would you want to expose your body to these
things that could potentially cause cancer and the other thing is that manufacturers don't
have to reveal their ingredients if it is a proprietary blend basically make sure that it's
organic free of acrylics free of something called p-e-t plastics solvents and heavy metals and iron
oxide the last point if you already had tattoos i think the best thing to do is to make sure that
you are eating very healthily make sure that your immune system is really strong because your immune
system has a very unique function of not only fighting pathogens but also preventing and killing
cancer cells all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course

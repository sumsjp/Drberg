let's talk about sulfites what has more sulfites red wine or white wine now I'm
not recommending that you do wine or alcohol on the ketogenic plan but
certain people will drink some wine occasionally when they're doing keto and
there's been some questions about various symptoms that can occur when
they're drinking wine so I just wanted to do a video in the various reactions
that can occur so first of all let's talk about sulfides that is a chemical
that naturally occurs when you ferment grapes but it is also a preservative
that is added to wine as an antioxidant to slow down the process of it turning
into vinegar so if wine did not have this preservative it would eventually
just turn to alcohol certain people are sensitive to sulfites and those people
that are sensitive may experience hives and itchiness a red flushing sensation
or even feeling dizzy but it's actually not red wine that has the most sulfites
it's the white wine white wine has 210 parts per million red wine has 160 but
if you're doing sweet wine that is 400 parts per million and talking about
sulfites because red wine has more tannins and tannins are a compound in
plants that act as a pesticide and so it would be in like tea leaves nuts with
the whole skin dark chocolate strawberries coffee pomegranates and if
you're sensitive to tannins you can get headaches or even migraines so if you're
drinking red wine and you get a headache chances are it's the tenons or if you're
drinking a lot of alcohol and having a hangover with it that just means that
you drank way too much now also realize that sulfites are in a lot of other
foods as well including dried fruit which basically has like ten times
amount of sulfites than wine now let's say for example you drink wine and your
nose is stuffy that's probably going to be the histamines because histamines
occur in fermented foods and wine is a fermented product
and if you're intolerant to histamines you're gonna notice more of a sinus
congestion so if you're drinking wine and you get these symptoms hives
itchiness fleshiness dizziness that means soft lights if you get headaches
it could be tannin especially if it's the red wine if it's a stuffy nose it
could be an intolerance to histamines and I put several videos down below so
you can get more data on each specific issue

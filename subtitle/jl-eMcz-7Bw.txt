hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the relationship
and the connection between cortisol and insulin okay what is that connection so I'm using CIPA
endocrinology of volume 4 to show you this connection on page 84 okay so here's what
happens the adrenal gland is a catabolic hormone what does that mean it means it's a hormone that
breaks down proteins so what it'll do if there's too much cortisol it will block protein from going
to the muscle so you will not be able to take these amino acids and stick them to the muscle
instead it's shunted to the liver where it's broken down and converted into carbohydrates
that's called gluco neo genesis means making new sugar happens in the liver from the adrenal so
this is why you see so many issues with diabetes insulin resistance with cortisol now in some
of the other videos I talked about cortisol making belly fat it's really the connection
between cortisol making more insulin than making belly fat so we really have a situation where
the cortisol converts the carb converts protein to carbohydrate spikes insulin and creates the
belly flat belly fat diabetes and cholesterol so if you're eating really good and you're not
losing weight it could be coming from the cortisol which is the stress hormone even
if someone takes prednisone which is a medical artificial synthetic cortisone that can do it
too up I'll see people that get treated with quarter Prentis own with some type of disease
or autoimmune and bam these ends to end up with diabetes because this relationship so it's just
another connection I wanted to mention so you might want to look into it if you have
the situation and I have a lot of videos and what to do about cortisol thanks for watching

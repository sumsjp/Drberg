hey guys it's me in this video we're going to talk about how to fix a broken
metabolism this is the most important thing you need to know so if you're
doing anything right now that's distracting you put it away get a piece
of paper take notes okay the first thing I need to do is give you a little
foundation so you understand what I'm gonna talk about next
okay so I'm gonna kind of build on this so so as we go just take notes number
one there's some the facts about the metabolism is that when you go on a diet
you will slow your metabolism so dieting slows your metabolism if you've dyed it
for many many years and then your metabolism is very very
slow if you've never dyed it then your metabolism is probably a lot faster okay
so dieting also increases hunger and cravings if you never look at the show
The Biggest Loser they always make it look so you know like dramatic like how
can they lose all that weight but what happens when these guys start losing
they start slowing down and slowing down where it's really really tough until
they have to exercise so hard to get off that last bit of weight it's crazy and
then they don't show they have to sign a waiver
many of these people gain the weight right back okay and I'll tell you why in
a second so also age slows your metabolism surprised you're probably
already finding it out so exercise will increase hunger and cravings too with
some people but mainly hunger because you're you're burning stuff up you're
going to want more and the last thing is it's very unnatural to lose weight very
unnatural losing weight is anti survival because fat is a survival mechanism so
when you try to lose it it goes against a survival so really we need to dive in
like the understanding of what that is so we can undo it but we're talking
really about your set point and the set point is the point at which your body
very uh likes to be weight wise it's just settles into the certain point it
doesn't like to go below that it might not even go higher than that but it
likes to settle down at a certain point so my goal is to help
in this video show you how to lower that setpoint so for example let's say your
setpoint is 182 and you want to get to 142 so we need to drop the set point and
that's really the metabolism point where your body kind of settles into it likes
to the body just likes to be the same it doesn't like to go down too much because
that's starvation right so what we want to do is give you the next part of this
a foundation of how how we're going to fix the setpoint but first we have to
talk about what destroys the setpoint beyond just dieting okay so let me show
you that okay so here's what you need to know number one you have this thing
called the pancreas it's located underneath your left ribcage and the
pancreas has about a million islands of cells okay and there's this little
little tiny it looks like little ions islands in a bunch of tissue and they
call it islands of Langerhans after the guys name who discovered it but there's
different cells and they're called alpha beta Delta cells the beta cells are the
ones that were going to talk about first and 60% of those cells are made of cells
okay and the other 40% are other cells know what is beta cells the beta cells
make insulin okay so that's what they do so insulin is most known for regulating
sugar right in carbohydrates so what insulin does is it lowers the sugar in
the blood okay so that's what I'm going to kind of build on this but you need to
understand that so insulin lowers the sugar and but the other thing is that
insulin also has other functions that a lot of people don't realize number one
it affects fat metabolism it affects protein metabolism okay so it makes it
converts sugar into cholesterol it converts sugar into triglycerides those
are blood fats it basically increases the tension on the arteries increasing
blood pressure it retains sodium okay it drives protein or amino acids
into the cells and so there's a and we'll get more into that in a bit but I
wanted just to have you understand that protein insulin is a lot more to do just
just in carbohydrate metabolism but for your viewpoint what you need to know
right now is that it's the thing that makes you makes fat it's the primary
regulator that makes you fat and it actually blocks any chance of burning
fat in the presence of a little bit of insulin you're not going to burn fat
period okay and this is out of guidance physiology and this is a known fact so
it'll make you fat and blocks the release of that okay so we have insulin
that is triggered by a high carbohydrate meal you probably know that you need
some bread you increase sugar and what happens your body will store that into a
stored sugar called glycogen so glycogen is a series of glucose molecules stuck
together okay it needs potassium to be stored so we
got stored sugar and then anything excess it turns into fat okay so we have
a combination of stored sugar and fat okay that's what insulin does and so
what happens though with a lot of people is they start getting a fatty liver so
it's really the insulin that makes the fatty liver especially if the person is
not consuming alcohol all right and then insulin if gone on too far will destroy
proteins yeah muscle wasting all the programming think about what part of
your body's protein you got intracellular proteins you have
like so many different proteins your body is gonna waste those and it's going
to convert those into sugar and it's going to leave carbon skeletons so it's
just basically going to leave the waste and it's going to convert everything
else to sugar and basically that's what destroys the diabetic is that they get
clogged arteries a stroke they have their kidneys fail
and then they had a protein destruction that's why they usually have protein
coming out of the kidneys and they destroy that and say you have everything
that kind of spills off into the rest of the tissue so it's a very ugly
destructive disorder and then what happens normally there's supposed to
happen is before a meal you should have a blood sugar between let's say 75 and
90 like it's say 80 and 90 okay but normal also it can go up to 100 so let's
say between 80 and a hundred that's normal before you eat okay what happens
though when you eat the blood sugar should normally spike up to like 120 it
can even go up up to like 140 after a meal okay but the closer you get to 140
the more you're becoming a problem so if it's above 140 then you become more
diabetic because of diabetes you have this spike in sugar because the insulin
is not there to keep it in check so it's out of control
so what happens normally is you eat it comes spikes to 120 and then it comes
back down to normal after 2 to 3 hours that's normal because the insulin
controls that blood sugar but in a diabetic situation it raises too high
out of control you get tired brain fog and then it takes a long time to come
back and reset okay so so now let's go on to the next part high insulin over
time or plus time equals insulin resistance now a good analogy would be
let's say you live in or near the train track and there's a train that goes over
your house and you live like there's like a metro or something and at first
you can't sleep because it's so noisy but over time you you become
desensitized you don't hear it anymore because you get used to it so same thing
being exposed to an antibiotic you become antibiotic resistant okay so when
you have too much of a hormone especially insulin the receptor that's
supposed to receive that hormone gets altered it compensates it downgrades so
it doesn't absorb it so basically your body is trying to reject insulin because
it's too high okay so what causes this and resist
this is too much insulin okay so you have a situation where you have too much
insulin but you also have not enough insulin in certain places of your body
like in the self and in the blood but we have too much insulin other places so
you can have symptoms of both hyper and hypoglycemia interesting so let's go
through the symptoms fatty liver okay if you have a fatty liver you have insulin
resistance if you have insulin resistance you have found a liver
because one thing will also cause another because some of the fat in liver
actually releases certain inflammatory responses that make you insulin
resistance so it's really a nasty double-edged sword brain fog okay high
fasting insulin so even when you're not eating sugar the insulin is still high
in certain places of your body remember insulin blocks fat burning okay
belly fat blow team digestive issues sleep sleepy after meal light so you eat
lunch and you have to take a nap that's classic
insulin resistance high blood blood pressure why because insulin causes
tension within the arteries cravings and hunger well wait a second that's a low
insulin situation but it's an insulin resistance symptom but it's really
certain parts of your body have a low insulin because the cell won't let it
kind of connect so you're basically craving and hungry all the time dark
pigment in your folds up in different folds of your body like you're growing
your armpits your neck you have a little a darker pigmentation that can happen in
advanced stages and hunger between meals so you can't go a long period of time
without getting hungry or having a blood sugar issue that's insulin resistance so
in sun resistance is the single biggest problem for that controls your setpoint
it destroys your setpoint okay why because insulin is is the hormone
that tells your body whether to burn fat or not okay it's going to it's going to
become more clear as we go through the next part - so insulin
increases fat prevents the burning of fat and controls and destroys your
setpoint other net is perfectly fine let me show you the next part okay so now
the big question is what causes insulin resistance okay high insulin but what
causes insulin to spike right you already know it's sugar but there's some
other things that will increase insulin as well and that would be protein some
types of protein more than others okay and what I'm talking about is I'm
talking about the protein doesn't trigger glucose so you've probably heard
of the glycemic index right well that's the level of the foods that trigger the
sugars but have you ever heard of the insulin index completely different okay
I'm going to talk about the next section but the point is there are other factors
that will increase insulin that don't increase glucose it's this is this
explains why you probably are eating healthy no sugars and you're still not
at losing weight now before you get freaked out and say hey I have to not
have to give up protein hear me out okay because there's some other solutions but
the point is that especially for eating a large amount of proteins but protein
does trigger insulin to some degree if we look at the different types of
proteins well let me just say that - the next one
but gastrointestinal hormones what does that mean it means that there are
hormones in your your GI tract that also increase in fund so really every time
you eat you increase insulin okay so there's a couple of foods that don't
increase insulin I'll I'll get into that next section but the point I'm trying to
make is that there's other things that are messing you up other than just the
sugar estrogen increases insulin as well yeah that explains why women when they
get pregnant they go through the menstrual cycle they get fatter okay
especially if the estrogen is too high so so we're going to talk about the
insulin index in the next section alright now check this out
this is the insulin index okay very different than the glycemic index for
the most part but look at butter it's 2% it's very very low does barely triggers
influent at all just slightly okay olive oil 3% coconut oil 3% so really all the
fats are there's no stimulation and this is why you can get away with eating the
fat more than going low-fat because watch what happens as we go up the scale
we have low fat yogurt 76% so when you go low fat cheese we get rid of the
buffer for the insulin and the protein is higher and you get more insulin so
all these low fat things at the store are creating insulin problems because
they're not using the fat as a buffer for insulin and that's why even ice
cream recipe that I have is that the heavy cream look at heavy cream is 4%
okay that's low it doesn't stimulate insulin so it's not gonna it's not going
to destroy the setpoint it's not going to create a problem now you can eat too
much of it but the point is that it's not going to be the importance of
getting rid of it is very very minimal okay so it's it's much more important to
avoid the higher insulin things but check this out egg yolk 15% that's
pretty low but look at the egg the whole egg and I'm sorry leg whites is 55% how
many people do you know that just do egg whites thinking they're doing themselves
some good and they're not doing the egg yolk the egg yolk is much better for
weight loss if we combine the egg yolk with the egg whites we get the whole egg
it brings it down to 21% so by adding fat with a meal you're actually helping
the situation now it is true when you go through ketosis you can you could be
burning your own your dietary fat and not your own fat but don't be afraid to
consume whole things don't go lean at all okay
don't be afraid to use some butter don't be afraid to use some of these products
so look at this we got peak it's very very low bacon 9% see in your
mind you're probably like why needs some lean bacon no you don't you want the
fattier bacon because the leaner the protein the more spikes insulin peanut
butter 11% cheese 15% turkey 23% berries 47 look at beef 51% so these people that
do the Atkins diet let's say they do it the first time it works the second time
it doesn't really work as well the third time it doesn't work at all why because
dieting slows and metabolism it destroys the setpoint and they're actually
increasing their insulin not as bad as a sugar person but that's really what
happens look at Apple 75% low-fat yogurt 76 percent of banana 84 percent whole
wheat bread 96 baked beans a hundred percent potatoes 121 percent I'm going
to give you a download you can download this page in the download section so you
have a whole list of this and I will also share in the extra section some
food plans to show you what food you should be eating just to take it one one
step further ok now so I'm just bringing your awareness up that there are foods
that are messing you up they're not necessarily sugars okay and I want to
show you next this one little point here which is very very very important and
and I know I kind of spent a lot of time getting to this point but this is the
most important point of this whole presentation okay so if high levels of
insulin over a period of time causes and resistance then what happens is we have
breakfast lunch and dinner right so here's the problem when we eat even the
hormones in our digestive tract spike insulin boom okay so we know we're gonna
get rid of this sugar and all that and that's great but if you snack in between
the meals if you're aking even with healthy things okay
you're spiking the insulin so we never have a chance to correct insulin
resistance so you must shoot for three meals a day or two not to lower calories
because we're going to increase some fat but simply to correct the insulin
resistance now how do you know if you have inserted resistance well all those
symptoms if you have belly fat if you you have you're going to have a fatty
liver if you have a fatty liver you're going to have insulin resistance if you
have insulin resistance you're going to have a fatty liver a fatty liver you're
going to have visceral fat around here so it's all kind of connected so the
point is that you want to shoot for only doing three meals a day okay that's
number one but here's the thing some people when they get up in the morning
are not hungry so don't eat even though the breakfast is the most important your
breakfast might be delayed until lunch if you're not hungry in that morning
don't consume any food only eat when you're hungry this this is a lie to
state that you need six meals a day it's just going to screw things up so we
don't eat until we're hungry and then we eat okay now if you want a little snack
let's say circuit free chocolate or whatever you can eat that right at the
end of the meal but not in the middle of the meals not between meals if you are
so hungry and ravenously craving between meals then we have to increase a little
bit more food during the meal itself specifically fat low glycemic fat okay
and what that means is you have insulin resistance that's why you have almost
like a blood sugar issue there and then the same thing at night don't consume
past your dinner okay now some of my clients are doing they're basically
they're not hungry in the morning they eat a big lunch and they need a dinner
and they're done two meals and that's incredible because you're doing an
intermittent fasting for the next period of time so you're gonna you're gonna
heal the insulin resistance you're going to lower your setpoint me I have to hit
you to breakfast and then a lunch and I barely will have a dinner I'm
have a small little kale shake and I'm done so it's like two and a half meals a
day so you can do that as well but the key is don't snack at night okay
you can drink tea and things like that all right
so and then the last section I'm going to give you a series of additional
things that you can do to improve insulin resistance
okay so intermittent fasting is a very important thing to implement but you
don't necessarily have to go the whole day without eating you can start with
three meals and then go down to two if you want to alternate and do every other
day you know skip a meal that's totally fine to kiyose as you do this you're
gonna control your sugar it's better between meals and you won't have to eat
as much because you're thinking about it when you're fasting you're living off
your own fat if you have reserve to burn then might as well burn that up when you
hit your goal you don't necessarily have to do fast anymore it's not starving
your body it's basically getting your body just more efficiently just switch
over to fat-burning and not burn your sugar because if you actually can't make
it to the next meal that means that you're just burning sugar so we have to
improve this so there's several things we can do to lower insulin okay number
one apple cider vinegar helps blood Sugar's tremendously so you can consume
that with a meal if you don't like it you can consume it as a pill put in but
if you're gonna do it in water a teaspoon per glass okay fermented foods
are much better for insulin than anything else so fermented cabbage
sauerkraut that's all really good because it has a vinegar in it as well
high potassium food that would be all the vegetables now here's the problem
when we do this when we lower insulin you're going to be living off your fat
and you're gonna have a lot more fat being burned which means that your liver
has to process a lot more fat burning if you do this without eating enough
vegetables you're gonna end up with a fatty or liver so there is no choice you
have to consume larger amounts of greens you can blend them you can drink them
but you need to consume that to keep the fat flesh from the liver that's the only
way you're going to get rid of the fatty liver okay so then we got high potassium
foods that's vegetables high vitamin b1 is also will decrease the need for
insulin that would be a nutritional yeast okay make sure you don't buy the
synthetic version though fiber it's also in my adrenal de formula to have b1
that's a natural one fiber like if you're going to do a choice between a
kale shake with the fiber like a blended versus a juice it's better to do the
fiber because the fiber buffers the insulin okay so we want fiber rich foods
celery is great fat consume more pure fats why it's not that we're telling you
that fats going to necessarily cause you to lose a lot of weight but it's very
sustaining between the meals and it has no effect on insulin it's gonna help
correct it so what we're trying to do is we're trying to get you to eat enough
fat so you can go longer without having to eat the reason why we're going longer
is so we can reverse the flow and not have sustained persistent insulin but
have like a low instance situation because if you have diabetes and you and
you constantly have high sugar well if you don't eat you're not gonna have high
sugar so guess what this is really good for a diabetic and this is how you
reverse diabetes because what is insulin resistance it's a type 2 diabetes but
you can have a version of it doesn't come like this you can have a small
version of it that's not it's like a pre-diabetes situation okay so lowering
cortisol that's with the stress reducing the stress doing my adrenal techniques
all that removing body stress is important because cortisol releases
glucose which increases insulin and reducing estrogen if you have too much
of it so if your period is heavy we can do the technique on the ovaries if
you're taking estrogen not a great idea because it's going to cause you to gain
weight sleeping more is going to lower insulin exercising is going to lower
insulin we talked about vegetables okay so I gave you a lot of things that you
can do go ahead and start with the inner minute fasting or leave 3 meals and no
snacks and then try to go to overtime okay and watch what happens
your setpoint is going to go down this is how you fix it bro

so when did the ketogenic diet actually start now in the 1920s they used the ketogenic diet for
epilepsy but epilepsy was also treated with ketones i think unknowingly back in 500 bc
because they found if you restricted the diet and you just didn't feed patients with epilepsy
their epilepsy would go away and then there's doctors in the 20s which found that you could
mimic fasting by restricting carbohydrates okay so because of ketones obviously but
in the late 1800s before that there was a man by the name of william banting who was
pretty wealthy and he was overweight and he discovered that if you restrict carbohydrates
you can lose weight and so he wrote this little booklet called the letter of corpulence
corpulence means the state of being obese or fat okay this was back in 1863
and he wanted to get the word out so he basically gave this book out for free until it became a best
seller and he started to charge for it just to cover his expenses but in this book he talked
about getting rid of breads sugar potatoes and eating meat vegetables fish eating mutton which is
sheep over two years old and he recommended eating kidneys as an organ meat which is
actually very very healthy but of course it wasn't perfect keto because his diet also
consisted of a little bit of biscuit one ounce of toast some small amount of fruit and some alcohol
but overall it was a major move in the direction of doing a low-carb diet and this is why it worked
now in 1922 another banting dr frederick banting no relationship to william banting used insulin
for diabetes he was actually the co-inventor of insulin and even received the nobel prize
in medicine and this finally allowed diabetics to eat what they wanted and control their insulin now
before insulin was used in diabetics they actually used a low carb diet it was actually called the
allen diet from dr frederick allen which limited carbohydrates and even putting certain patients on
a very restricted calorie diet like 400 calories per day which is pretty extreme and of course
introduction of insulin and then also medications for diabetes pretty much made the low-carb diet
disappear for a while until dr atkins came in and promoted a low-carb diet and then of course now
ketogenic low-carb diet is the most popular diet in existence right now helping millions of people

hey guys in this video we're going to talk about Parkinson's disease okay like what is
it and what do you do about it it's a chronic degeneration of the central nervous system
and involves specifically a part of the brain called the substantia [ __ ] okay and that part
of the brain controls a neurotransmitter called dopamine now neurotransmitter is a hormone like
communication that doesn't travel to the blood it travels through the nerves okay and you have a lot
of different neurotransmitters but dopamine is the one that actually is diminished with
Parkinson's and symptoms with Parkinson's is like a resting tremor okay it's like like the
shakiness rigid very slow very stiff depressed flexed posture you're hunched over like this
eventually dementia okay those are the symptoms and if you look up what causes this condition
it's called idiopathic which is a fancy term for they don't know unknown cause right and there's
unknown cure they don't know what to do to cure it and then you give people what's called l-dopa
as a medication and then they when that doesn't work they give it a different type of it's called
a dopamine agonist which stimulates more dopamine so anyway they don't really know exactly what to
do about it so if you look deeply into literature you'll find some links between texts as pesticide
exposure and Parkinson's okay you'll also find the relationship between high incidence of head
trauma in Parkinson's but there's some other things that are very interesting findings and
there's usually always this abnormal protein in the brain called alpha synuclein just thought
you might want to know that but this abnormal protein accumulates in certain parts of the brain
abnormally and interferes with dopamine very similar to Alzheimer's you have amyloid plaque
so it's a another type of protein so dopamine basically controls the starting and stopping
of movement so if I would start the motion going and stop it it's controlled by dopamine okay so
Parkinson's you don't have that you can't start things and you can't stop things okay it's just
constantly changing so now the question is like what can you do for this condition well it just
will happen and if I had this condition this is what I would do there's an enzyme it's a very very
very powerful protein enzyme probably the most powerful proteolytic enzyme out there and it's
called serrapeptase and it was originally found in the intestines of the silkworm but
they're able to ferment it and make it so this is what you need to get so if you know someone start
putting them on this you can get it on Amazon you can get it anywhere but find one that is somewhat
qualities find one that is at least 250,000 IU's that's about 450 milligrams this must be taken
on an empty stomach why because it'll digest your food and instead of the protein plaquing
and the brain so it's interesting because this is a systemic enzyme which means it goes into
the digestive system goes into the blood and it travels through and dissolves scarring clogged
arteries protein in places where it shouldn't be and it doesn't harm your other proteins like your
help with your normal protein so it's really cool stuff so this is what you would want to take and
I would recommend taking two of these on empty stomach three times a day okay and I think you
would see some good changes with that so now as far as eating goes you definitely need to
get the person on a very healthy eating plan that has to do with more of a ketogenic type
eating plant why because the ketogenic type diet feeds the brain ketones which really is good at
improving circulation and decreasing degeneration because if you take a look at a brain from insulin
resistant type patient or a diabetic they don't have a lot of oxygen they have a lot
of inflammation they have a lot of degeneration in the brain so that would be one thing I would
also add to this this enzyme right here alright so thanks for watching and put your comments below

lowers your testosterone now visceral fat that fat around the organs okay in your midsection
is loaded with a very specific enzyme called aromatase okay and the more fat that you have
the more aromatase you're going to have now what is aromatase it's that enzyme that converts
testosterone and other androgens into estrogen and estrogen lowers your testosterone estrogen

aromatase okay so number one you need to lose the fat the easiest and the fastest way to do that is

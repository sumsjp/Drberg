so i had some questions about what's the difference between lazy keto versus dirty keto
let's chat about that it means that they're not counting calories and they're not counting ketones
so you're only going to focus on carbs keeping your carbs below 50 grams and those are net carbs
okay so minus the fiber so you do moderate protein roughly between three to eight ounces per meal
which comes out to roughly about one to two servings which is the size of your palm
of protein for men and about one serving or the size of your palm for women now you want to do
high fat but you're again not looking at calories most the fat's going to be within the protein but
you're definitely not focusing on the quality of those macros now to differentiate dirty keto
you're not focused on quality you're going to fast food places for example and let's see a
burger without the bun and you have some processed cheese on there and some bacon
none of it is grass-fed it's just basically what they're serving you but you're not doing the fun
and so the differentiating factor between lazy and dirty as lazy as you're not really focusing on
counting anything and dirty keto you're not focused on the quality of those calories
and so if you're at a restaurant a fast food restaurant they're going to probably give you msg
you're not concerned about that there's probably going to be less nutrients you're not going to
be worried about that it's definitely not going to be organic so there's going to be pesticides
and maybe glyphosate because it's going to be gmo and you're probably going to have higher amounts
of omega-6 fatty acids so your salad dressing might have soy oil or corn oil or canola or cotton
seed you're not concerned about that you could even have trans fats so that's what dirty keto is
and one more point about carbohydrates so the goal is to keep your carbs below 50 grams right
well both lazy and dirty keto are not looking at the type of carbohydrates so let's say for example
you go to the grocery store and you have peanut butter and you're buying that typically you have
to read the label because a lot of peanut butter has sugar in it and so if you're doing dirty keto
you're not going to be too concerned with the actual added sugar that's in the peanut butter
you'll count it but you have to realize that that sugar is added could be gmo and it's very high on
the glycemic index so it's going to definitely spike you your blood sugars compared to let's
say the sugar in berries which has all the fiber it's more of a natural type sugar it's not added
sugar it's within the food and so it's a higher quality sugar than the sugar that
they add because i just wanted to bring that out because the type of keto that i always recommend
is the healthy keto which has not just the right macro ratios but it's nutrient
dense and you're definitely focusing on the quality of food organic grass-fed while caught
pasture-raised hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what

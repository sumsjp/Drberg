let's talk about the five causes of bruising let's say you have these little
red dots or these little tiny spider veins or some red patch
on your body let's talk about the potential causes of that
especially if you haven't injured yourself there are different names for
bruising ecchymosis contusions basically what's
happening you're getting capillary damage
right underneath the skin the capillaries are are breaking
and it's bleeding so number one you could be in a blood thinner that's the
obvious thing or taking aspirin number two this is uh not very known
low calcium when your calcium goes too low
you get bruising interesting that can come from many different things
it's usually not low calcium in the diet it's usually from something like gastric
bypass surgery because when they do this you become
severely low in vitamin d without vitamin d you can't
absorb calcium so it could be a vitamin d
deficiency that's creating this low calcium
all right calcium channel blockers that's the medication for blood pressure
that could do it as well number three low vitamin k1 vitamin k1
helps you clot it's a fat soluble vitamin
so if you have malabsorption in your gut or you have a lack of bile let's say you
don't have a gallbladder or you have gallstones
or you have some liver problem or a kidney problem
you're not gonna be able to absorb this vitamin let alone this vitamin right
here and then that alone can create bruising
now antibiotics also destroy the bacteria
that make vitamin k1 so vitamin k1 is very very important
because there's something about bleeding internally that is very anti-survival
so we need to have k1 so not only does it come
from leafy greens and vegetables but it also
comes from your own bacteria so you have this backup
but if you destroy the bacteria that could be one source of vitamin k1
deficiency now also vitamin c can be low vitamin c
has everything to do about keeping your capillaries
strong so without vitamin c you lose the collagen
that surrounds the capillaries and you start
having bleeding one mild version or a subclinical
vitamin c deficiency or scurvy would be bleeding gums so the
capillaries are easily damaged when you brush your teeth
and we know you're low in vitamin c vitamin c sauerkraut bell pepper
leafy greens pretty much the same vegetables that are loaded with k1
are also loaded with vitamin c but of course
one cause would be let's say you don't consume vegetables well that could be
why you're bruising so we need vitamin c also
sugar blocks the absorption of vitamin c smoking
inhibits vitamin c stress inhibits vitamin c
taking synthetic vitamin c is something i don't really recommend
um it's a cheap version of the natural vitamin c
that comes from nature i would recommend you get a food-based or
or a herb that is high in vitamin c or food that is high in vitamin c versus a
just a synthetic vitamin c and number five
low platelets another name for platelets are thrombocytes
these are things in your blood that are associated with
clotting now that could be a low vitamin b12
or low folate which by the way comes from leafy greens
or you're on some medication and one of the side effects is
low platelets all right next step if you have bruising is to
isolate which one of these are involved and address it

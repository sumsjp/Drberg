so in this video i want to show you the best way to identify
arsenic poisoning okay through the nails there's a condition called leukonychia
the greek word for leuco means white and then onchi is
the nail leukonychia is basically a horizontal
white band on your nails and that can be arsenic poisoning
but there are many other symptoms as well one would be
headache confusion severe diarrhea because your body is trying to get rid
of it drowsiness you're vomiting blood you
have blood in the urine hair loss cramping stomach pain
your skin is darkening your skin is getting thicker
night blindness which mimics a vitamin a deficiency because arsenic
depletes your vitamin a vitamin b1 deficiency because arsenic blocks the
absorption of vitamin b1 and that will give you a
whole series of additional symptoms an increase of
hydrogen peroxide that can affect the color of your hair
and you'll lose your pigment you can actually go gray and even
convulsions and other than that you're doing pretty
good now a couple reasons why you may have arsenic poisoning one
is you're consuming rice rice has been found to have high levels
of arsenic also you could get it from your water
supply there's been many outbreaks around the world where there's been
contamination of arsenic in the water supply and you know even
thousands of people in certain areas are are becoming exposed to it and also
there's been certain types of wine that have been tested
positive for arsenic probably because of contamination with the water
that the plant pulled it in you have the pollution
or the byproduct for arsenic from manufacturing things like that
but then you also have arsenic in the soil as a natural occurrence
you also have fluoride you have mercury cadmium you have a lot of different
heavy metals what happens is the plant will absorb
the minerals and heavy metals okay because every single plant has very
very small amounts of these heavy metals that are considered
toxic in large amounts and i just want to mention
that when you get a trace mineral product that is
plant-based you're going to get small amounts of all
the heavy metals and i just want to mention that the
chemistry of the or how that heavy metal is bound in a plant
versus in the soil is very very different on a plant you have
the chemistry as organic minerals okay in
soil it's inorganic the definition of organic that i'm using is not the same
as like without pesticides the other definition of organic is that it's a
plant-based chemical bond that greatly reduces the
toxicity but if you're getting some type of
industrial byproduct that's in the soil that this plant is
growing on especially arsenic then that plant can have very high
levels of arsenic so even though it may be an organic chemical bond
because it's plant-based arsenic that's going to be a lot more toxic
because of the concentration but typically if we're not dealing with this
high amounts of a certain heavy metal it's nothing to worry about if you
suspect that you have arsync poisoning you could actually get
a hair analysis to pick it up there's
other tests that you can do you can get a blood test
the detox remedies for arsenic poisoning that i would recommend
would be blue blue-green algae because it's a chelator and it can actually pull
out certain heavy metals selenium will also
help to detoxify arsenic if you haven't seen my other video on arsenic
i put it up right here check it out

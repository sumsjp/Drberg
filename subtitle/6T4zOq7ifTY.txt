hey guys it's dr. Berg here I want to talk about a hidden stress that has
to do with your environment right your environment is very crucial for your
adrenals your sanity and your stress level there's so many things in your
environment that trigger stress everything from you know watching TV
people watch the news all a lot and it's just amazing how the message what is the
message that they're trying to put out there it's a dangerous environment it
don't go outside it's dangerous so you watch it up a period of time and your
mind becomes fixated on the fear which keeps the adrenal glands going worst
thing to do is watch the news right before bed because this goes it starts
running internet right there's stuff there's pornography there's degraded
things on the internet there's a lot of crap on the Internet
YouTube especially so you have to personally select what is in your
environment in your space and not allow everything to come through at work
there's a lot of maybe negativity with certain people you know you're gonna
have to somehow change that environment so you need to be able to set up your
world your space where you selectively not get all these triggers all the time
because it's constantly if you if I dissect one of my patients their lives
and I just look at all these things there are tons and tons of things that
are affecting their adrenals without even being aware of doing that so with
what all the stress will do it kind of sticks you into the past alright this is
where the stress is right here and past pictures and memories that have pain so
what we want to do is we want to push you more into the future okay so you
want to live more in the future more and imagination you know daydream about how
beautiful the future is going to be for you in your life and I'm not talking
about I'm worried for the future you're really actually stuck in the past being
in the future is a completely blank slate that you're
creating it's all it's not even there yet you're putting it out there it's a
very healthy place to be okay now you could be in the present but the average
person is not even in the present they're may be like 30% the present and the rest
in the past they're stuck in all these different memories and pictures they're
going going going they can't they can't help it so being in the present is very
therapeutic like for example I might watch TV a comedy but the same time I'll
be building Legos at home at night I'll be drawing coloring and things like that
my wife and I do that that's a very therapeutic because we're taking our
attention and putting it on something in the present that forces you to be in the
present very good exercise very therapeutic and if you can do to create
something music something on writing or some of something that you're creating
is very very therapeutic or helping someone that's a good therapy going for
a walk or a hike we're doing something with crafts very therapeutic because it
forces you to be in the present and in the present there's no there's no scary
anything it's mainly in the past so what I'm telling you here is just do what you
can to start changing your environment in controlling your environment the way
you want it to help your adrenals because that is a factor that a lot of
people don't think about they'll start eating healthy and exercising but
they're not changing their environment to how they want it they're at the
effect of their environment and start with the TV you know don't watch scary
movies don't watch the news watch comedy something because be selective on what
you see even on Facebook there's a bunch of degrading things on there and start
to put some control in on your environment and only hang out with
people that bring you up and ignore the other people right now it's for your own
health okay all right I'll see you guys in the next video

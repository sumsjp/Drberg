hey guys in this video we're gonna talk about the four things to avoid if you
have an enlarged prostate okay now I've observed this with a lot
of clients over the last 29 years okay and the first one I want to talk about
is this one right here dairy okay that includes cheese milk yogurt cream cheese
sour cream even butter why because I noticed when men then have enlarged
prostates consume dairy what happens is they have a difficult time going to the
bathroom because their prostate swells up even more the prostate is kind of
like a sponge for hormones so where does dairy come from it comes from milk a
pregnant cow used to grow a calf okay so it's growth hormones growth factors so
we want to avoid dairy if you have a prostate problem okay if you don't have
a prostate problem I think a high quality dairy like an in the form of
grass-fed occasionally is going to be totally fine okay number two vegetable
oils the problem is in the salad dressings you have all these vegetable oils
that are omega-6 okay those are inflammatory soy corn canola not to
mention their GMO which is a whole other topic so that's going to be inflammatory
for the prostate you can totally do olive oil okay in vinaigrette that's not
a problem that's the type of dressing you need on your salad all right number
three sugar that's a given I'm sure you already know that you have to avoid
sugar because that's going to be inflammatory and of course the things
that turn into sugar like grains breads and pasta and things like that
number four soy soy protein isolates there's a lot of products out there with
soy we mentioned the oil right here but just soy in general can enlarge the
prostate because it can actually give you estrogenic factors okay so there you
have it the four things that you want to avoid if you have an enlarged prostate

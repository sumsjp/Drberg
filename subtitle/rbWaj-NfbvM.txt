does skipping meals actually worsen your metabolism
i've heard that before so i want to talk about that in this video
fasting or intermittent fasting less frequent meals equals a decrease
in insulin insulin is a hormone that controls a certain enzyme
okay it's a fat dissolving enzyme it's called hormone sensitive lipase
anytime you see ace that's an enzyme lip describes the word
lipids which is fats so fat dissolving enzyme okay the way you trigger this
which is the fat-burning enzyme is you lower insulin we go from fat
to energy so insulin is the key hormone that controls that if we have high
insulin we inhibit this we block this enzyme so
no fat can be burned so by lowering insulin you increase
the three most powerful fat burning hormones too so this will help burn fat
from another angle growth hormone glucagon and
noradrenaline if we take a look at the high insulin
conditions we have pcos okay polycystic
ovarian syndrome what's causing this high insulin do they have a slow
metabolism absolutely yes obesity people that are obese have a
slow metabolism why because they have high insulin
metabolic syndrome or syndrome x same thing when you have
blood sugar issues like diabetes high blood pressure
obesity it's basically the symptoms they're all symptoms
of high insulin do we have a slow metabolism here
yes we do okay diabetes do we have high insulin yes we do do we
have a slow metabolism absolutely and then we have cushing's
syndrome this is a situation where you have high levels of cortisol
where you have this belly fat a lot of times
these guys get diabetes why because the high level of insulin
a lot of the protein in the body is being converted into
glucose which is raising insulin now on the flip side how do you slow
your metabolism down very simply start consuming frequent
small meals that are high in carbohydrates
and low in calories this would be the classic
diets that you've seen in the 70s and the 80s
and even the 90s but recently the shift has gone more keto low carb
even a lot of these weight loss programs that used to be high
carb are now going low carb or at least having
types of products that are low carb like slim fast for example they have
keto friendly shakes now so it's very interesting that
everything is shifting to low carb a little bit higher fat does skipping
meals actually slow your metabolism no they increase the metabolism if you
keep your carbs low

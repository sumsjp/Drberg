today i want to talk about the most important things you need to know if you have acid reflux so
i have this diagram of the stomach there's a valve on the top part and there's a valve on the lower
part the valve on the top prevents acid and food from regurgitating up through
the esophagus the valve in the bottom controls the food from the stomach
into the small intestine as well as controlling the food and bile from regurgitating back up into
the stomach so both of these valves are sphincters it's like a circular muscle that is controlled by
the autonomic nervous system so the muscular control is kind of a gradual contraction and
a gradual relaxation until it's fully open and so the problem we have with these valves is they're
if they're open at the wrong time or close at the wrong time we can have a big problem with acid
and bile ending up in the wrong place now because they're controlled by the autonomic nervous system
that means that they're highly influenced with this thing called stress and this is why there are
so many digestive problems that can be affected by stress like acid reflux heartburn and the list
goes on and on and on and so if you have acid reflux and a lot of stress you know you're gonna
have to do something to reduce that stress before it starts improving now the other thing that
controls these sphincters is calcium calcium has the function of muscular contraction so it helps
close these sphincters but most of the time people are lacking the vitamin that controls calcium
i'm talking about vitamin d if you're deficient in vitamin d you're not going to have enough calcium
and the valve is not going to close fully and incidentally vitamin d also acts like cortisol in
the body and there's a lot to do with controlling stress and by taking vitamin d that can actually
help reduce your stress and can help directly close the valve just from the function of vitamin
d itself now the other cause of this valve on the top of the stomach opening at the wrong time
is because you don't have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach apparently there are receptors or
sensors in that valve for hydrochloric acid so we have the synchronization of food coming
through the valve closing and acid increasing so you can get a complete digestion so if you don't
have enough hydrochloric acid or the acid in your stomach is not acid enough that valve might not
close and that can cause the regurgitation effect so what can cause a deficiency of hydrochloric
acid well one is low chlorides as in low salt so if you're on a low salt diet or not taking
enough sea salt that could be the reason why you don't have enough hydrochloric acid
also it takes potassium to also make hydrochloric acid so you need those electrolytes as the
building blocks to make hydrochloric acid now another big cause of low hydrochloric acid is
medication induced hypochlorhydria that is low stomach acid caused by antacids
especially the ppis now there are also foods that actually can aggravate the situation gluten grains
sugar of course alcohol and omega-6 fatty acids as in all the soy oil the canola oil the corn oil
the cottonseed oil and of course all the processed foods and the junk foods
those can not only disrupt the opening closing of the valves but they can also disrupt the
production of hydrochloric acid let me first talk about the importance of hydrochloric acid
okay number one its role in intestinal hormones you have all sorts of hormones
that are involved in your digestion and your small intestine that's secreted from the pancreas that's
secreted from the small intestine itself and without hydrochloric acid they can't work a lot
of the enzymes that are in the upper part of the digestive system they're activated by a certain
ph hydrochloric acid being an acid activates these enzymes so they can work all right number two hcl
prepares folate and b12 for absorption number three hydrochloric acid helps the absorption of
minerals i'm talking about calcium magnesium potassium zinc and iron all right number four
hydrochloric acid is also necessary for something called the intrinsic factor for the absorption of
b12 another mechanism of b12 absorption if you don't have enough b12 you're going to have a lot
of neurological problems and a lot of pain from nerve damage all right next one is hcl is vital
in the prevention of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth this is the prevention of bacteria
growing in the small intestine that's the wrong place we want bacteria growing in the large
colon not the small intestine and so without hydrochloric acid you can get sibo hcl is
vital in preventing pathogens microbes that are unfriendly going through the stomach and invading
the body so we need this hydrochloric acid to kill off unfriendly bacteria fungus viruses that are in
our foods and also hcl is vital in preventing food allergies because we want to take this protein
break it down fully into amino acids and so if it's not fully broken down your immune system
can react to it and you can develop allergies all right so let me just touch briefly on the
valve on the bottom part of the stomach okay and this valve is very important in preventing
bile from regurgitating up into the stomach and then up into the esophagus bile can irritate
the esophagus just as much as hydrochloric acid because it's a detergent and it can break down
the mucous layer and create a lot of pain and irritation now there's three main culprits or
problems with that happening number one excess belly fat if you have too much visceral fat
all that fat can put pressure up into this area and cause a regurgitation of bile back up into
the stomach number two hiatal hernia and for more information about that i put a video down below
so you can learn a real simple technique to help that condition and lastly if you have a
gallbladder problem or you have bile sludge or even gallstones that's obstructing the flow of
bile that can create a backup bile into the system and the solution for that is purify bile salts all
right so what are the very important things you need to do if you have acid reflux number
one i would recommend starting out taking the tane hydrochloride methane hydrochloride is a
really good remedy for acid reflux it's going to increase the concentration of acid in your stomach
and the problem with a lot of people when they take obtain hydrochloride is they think that
one or two with a meal is going to solve it usually they're going to need a lot more maybe
five six seven eight with a meal especially in the beginning and you would want to take it right
before the meal and you'll see it'll create a huge improvement in the digestion of your food and a
lessening of the backup of acid that's coming into your esophagus also apple cider vinegar is very
very important to add with that and you'll find great relief if you add both of those together now
if you're taking betaine heterochloride and apple cider vinegar and you feel worse it aggravates the
problem that could mean you either have an ulcer or gastritis in which case you need to switch your
plan of action and start taking chlorophyll or some organic raw wheatgrass juice powder
so that can help heal the irritation in your esophagus and your stomach the best vegetable
or even food for acid reflux is cabbage okay all forms of cabbage and even sauerkraut so
make mental note of that all right number three very important reduce your stress do whatever
you can to reduce your stress i have a thousand videos on how to do that all right number four
intermittent fasting if you're consuming six small meals or eating frequently just think
about what's happening you're stressing the entire digestive system intermittent fasting the decrease
of frequency of eating especially if you can do two meals or even one meal a day that's called
omad will greatly improve your acid reflux why because it gives your digestive system a chance to
reset and heal and not work so hard all right number five vitamin d i've already mentioned that
very important to prevent acid reflux number six zinc l-carnosine is not only good for ulcers
gastritis it's also good for gerd and acid reflux in fact zinc l-carnosine is good for anything
that's inflamed in your entire gastrointestinal tract and number seven taking a very good
probiotic because if you have the microbes helping you digest in the lower part of your your system
that'll take a huge stress off the top part of the digestive system because they're all connected
alright thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go
if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story

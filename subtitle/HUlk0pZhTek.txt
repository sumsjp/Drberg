hey guys dr. Berg here listen I want to talk about what I would do if I had MS multiple
sclerosis first of all what is it it's really this function of myelin myelin is that outer covering
that sheath that fat layer around the nervous system it's kind of like a an insulator of a wire
okay and that thing you're losing that and then you're getting all sorts of neurological issues
what's interesting is it follows the same process as atherosclerosis which is basically hardening
of the arteries because the word sclerosis comes from the Greek word which means hardening okay so
it's the same process there's theories out there that it's coming from an infection a microbe or
it's genetic that they don't know my thought it's a dysfunction in the lipids because the
production of myelin is very connected with the production of cholesterol it takes cholesterol to
make myelin and also the synapses that communicate together in the brain and the nervous system are
very dependent on cholesterol so there's must be some type of dysfunction with cholesterol well
there is in some other videos I talked about the the origin of what causes hardening of the
arteries I'll put a link down below but personally I think it's the exact same thing that's happening
in the brain let's take a look at the first thing that happens you have a lesion or some
type of ulcer and then you get this inflammatory process along with that comes a white blood cell
immune type connection so you have white blood cells you have inflammation the body is then
going to bring plaque to the area now plaque is mainly collagen and it's like fibrous tissue then
comes cholesterol and all that's trying to do is trying to heal something so the interesting
thing is like what is behind this whole process from the origin what's the cause of it well if
we look at okay you're losing myelin there's an impaired glucose to the brain so there's
brai... the glucose is not going the brain that's a common denominator and there's nearly always insulin resistance
which happens to degrade and breakdown myelin so really I think from the obvious things that we
talked about it's really a problem with insulin so we have high insulin now you could have high
cortisol from stress that can actually cause high insulin and that's probably another deeper cause
because there is antibodies connected to this as well and that's usually adrenal but we have
a situation we have high insulin inflammation and plaquing and so now what would I do if I had this
condition I would instantly do the ketogenic diet why because that would feed the body ketones of
fuel there's feed the brain ketones and it would create such a release on this whole starvation of
glucose that your brain would start coming alive now I've checked if you look at the relationship
between MS and ketogenic diets there's a lot of studies done with significant improvement so if
we can cut down the inflammation in the brain by running the body on ketones and not no longer run
sugar because sugar creates inflammation and we can fix insulin resistance we can
drop the inflammation down and grew and greatly improve the brain function so there's studies
down there there's also a link on what to eat on the ketosis diet but that's what I would do if I
had this condition put your comments down below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you report

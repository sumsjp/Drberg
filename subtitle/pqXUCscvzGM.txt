so baking soda is it good is it bad should you keep taking it for acid reflux
a lot of people are taking this thinking it's
good for them and they don't really understand what they're doing baking soda is sodium
bicarbonate now take a look at this we got the stomach right here the stomach normally should be
not just slightly acid extremely acid between one and three that's normal you need your stomach
acids to be at that ph to digest proteins to kill microbes and to absorb minerals okay now as this
food gets through the stomach it goes into the small intestine right here and the pancreas
releases a bicarbonate now remember what baking soda is it's sodium bicarbonate okay
so our bodies are supposed to have bicarbonates not in the stomach but just past the stomach in
the small intestine to neutralize the acid so it doesn't damage the small intestine and also the
bile that comes out of the gallbladder that's also alkaline to help neutralize it so bicarbonates are
are alkaline so what we're trying to do is we're trying to neutralize that acid but if you're
putting this baking soda this sodium bicarbonate at this level in the stomach you are going to mess
up your digestion down the road now you're going to feel better temporarily because of the acid
reflux it's going to help neutralize it but the next time you eat it's going to be a little bit
weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker because you're treating the symptom you're not treating
the cause of the problem the question is why is the stomach more acid why are you getting acid
reflux in the first place normally what happens is the valve on top of the stomach is not shutting so
that acid is refluxing back up into the esophagus it's also called gerd and so why is that it could
be from either an autonomic nervous system problem because you're deficient in b1 or it could be you
don't have enough stomach acid because that valve closes if you have enough stomach acid
and this is why people feel so much better when they start taking apple cider vinegar for problems
like this or they take betaine hydrochloride which is an acidifier they can build up their
hydrochloric acid they feel so much better and it's more correct sometimes you might take
three but in reality you may need five six seven eight even up to ten before a meal initially for
it to work just from experience working with a lot of people over many years i found that some
people just need more and then it works like a charm and the problem is they don't know that so
they try for a couple days they take a couple it doesn't do anything and then they give up
the key with that is taking more there's some other things you can do as well like
the combination of zinc carnosine and betaine hydrochloride is very effective for acid reflux
some of the long-term side effects that can occur if you're taking too much sodium bicarbonate over
a period of time vomiting diarrhea kidney damage depressed breathing because your
ph is altered worsened cardiac heart failure so if you already have pre-existing heart problems
and you're taking baking soda that throws off the ph it messes up the um the heart okay then
we have cerebral hemorrhage bleeding and then we have a deficiency of calcium which causes
muscle spasms then we have a decrease in potassium which leads to a whole cascade of
bad things that can happen after that you can get belching bloating but other than that you're good

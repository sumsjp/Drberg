i had a question recently that i wanted to answer
and this was the question will a liver cleanse
help my cirrhosis or will it help my fatty liver
my ammonia is high and is the liver cleanse gonna help me so
let's just talk about that now the first thing you should know
about cirrhosis it's an advanced situation in fact your risk for cancer
goes way up uh 80 percent of people with liver
cancer have some type of cirrhosis going on
because cancer tends to grow in damaged tissue
and as you damage the liver certain things don't work anymore there's an
enzyme called arginase this is an enzyme that is involved
in something called the urea cycle see when you break down protein into amino
acids the extra amount of it uh has to go
through as waste nitrogen waste so arginase
is necessary in making sure that happens making sure that there's a complete
breakdown so it can exit the body without any
toxicity if there's not enough arginase in the
liver we get an incomplete breakdown of arginine this is the amino
acid then we get higher amounts of ammonia
in the blood which can travel up to the brain
and that can create a lot of different side effects like
coma dementia all sorts of brain problems seizures
tremors so ammonia is very very toxic and too
much ammonia that builds up into the brain or the tissues
really is there because there's not enough this enzyme because there's
damage in the liver so the body cannot go
through its normal urea cycle and um clean up this extra
amount of protein going on now just as a side note when i'm talking
about damage to the liver i'm not just talking about cirrhosis
which kind of leaves your liver cells dysfunctional it can also be
a severely inflamed liver so you can have hepatitis
which leaves your liver dysfunctional you can have a fatty liver which
stops the function or scar tissue and sometimes the fat in the liver
creates inflammation that develops in the scar
sometimes inflammation in the liver leads to insulin resistance
which then creates more fat in the liver then you have a situation we have
inflammation in the liver which directly turns into scar tissue
that's cirrhosis now the big question is will a liver cleanse
help this well the problem is your liver is not dysfunctional because there's
toxins in it necessarily this is a progressive
chronic condition that has developed over years
that a liver cleanse probably is not going to even touch
it may instead stir up a hornet's nest it may
make your symptoms worse it could actually release
certain bacteria certain chemicals that are lodged in your fat cells and then
actually recirculate through your blood end up in your thyroid and create all
sorts of problems so i don't recommend a liver cleanse what i
do recommend is this number one i know this might
shock you but i'm going to recommend keto why
because keto is a much cleaner fuel it creates
less inflammation than carbs it's very beneficial to your liver and
it can help you in reducing a fatty liver
number two fasting what is that good for inflammation it'll help you drop
inflammation it'll give your liver a chance to heal and that's what
we're trying to minimize is the inflammation here to allow it to heal
so these two are essential you want to make sure that you do not consume too
much protein three ounces per meal would be perfect
why because the problem is that we have an
incomplete protein breakdown so why would we want to add more protein
to your liver it's already damaged you don't have enough of this enzyme
next thing to do is to take a product that has l-arginine
and manganese manganese is a good trace mineral to help detoxify you
and the amino acid which is a non-essential one l-arginine as a
supplement it's usually in a powder you can get it in capsules
can help reduce ammonia if there's not enough arginase there's not going to be
enough arginine so manganese is a precursor or a
building block for arginase and it can help to
increase the ability to detoxify the body number five we want to
increase vegetables and celery that gives us chlorophyll
and other natural phytochemicals to help the liver function a lot better
so instead of a detox cleanse the best way to clean the liver is
through the natural phytonutrients that comes from
food and chlorophyll will help as well the phytonutrients in plants
are enzymes that help different phases of detoxification
and without side effects so these are very very important in the
detoxification number six tocatrinals this is a type of
vitamin e that comes in handy and it's a very
powerful antioxidant in fact the tocotrienols
version of vitamin e is 50 times stronger than the tocopherols
and it can greatly and help inhibit inflammation
so if you have the start of cirrhosis or you have cirrhosis in the liver which is
scar tissue vitamin e is going to help in this form talk adrenals
but if you think about it vitamin e is good for scars right
helps break down scar tissue well why can't it work
for scar tissue on the inside of the body as well
very important and number seven probiotics
there's some great research on probiotics that can help decrease
ammonia in the body as well i put a link down below
but this is the protocol that i would recommend uh
way better than a liver cleanse by itself thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

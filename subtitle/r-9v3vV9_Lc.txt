i want to talk about steroid drugs they're a double-edged sword and i'm talking about the
cortical steroids i'm not talking about androgens or testosterone now this drug is used mainly
for anything connected with inflammation like rheumatoid type conditions rheumatoid arthritis
lupus vasculitis that's inflammation of your vascular system asthma hay fever allergies
hives psoriasis copd that's a chronic lung problem ibd that's irritable bowel disease
ms and all the other autoimmune conditions here's the problem when i was in my 20s i think it was
like 25 i got poison ivy and it got really bad and i took steroids every year after that probably for
15 years i had to get a series of steroid injections to handle this darn poison ivy
that i would keep getting every single year in the fall but as the years progressed it worked less
and less to the point where it didn't work anymore so if i get poison ivy which i keep getting every
year i can't take another steroid injection i just have to cope with it live with it and wait for
this poison ivy to go away and so my allergy to poison ivy has gotten pretty bad where if i touch
my eye it just swells up so if you do some searches on youtube you might find me doing
a video with these dark glasses because i'm trying to cover up this severe poison ivy reaction that
actually went into my eye so it's pretty pretty major allergy but the steroids that i took
really messed me up with my sleep cycles and my immune system but the two big effects that this
steroid cortisol has on our body are number one suppression of the entire immune system now that's
your army to fight all pathogens so it's very very dangerous to suppress your entire immune system
and the second effect is to suppress inflammation another dangerous thing especially in the healing
process so steroids suppress the t cells that help fight infection especially viruses that
invade your cells so then the t cells are supposed to kill off and now they can't kill them off so we
have this runaway viral infection they suppress the macrophages that actually go around and eat
viruses and and yeast and parasites and bacteria like pac-man cortisol also suppresses the other
white blood cells like the neutrophils the basal cells the eosinophils that have a lot to do
with other functions of the immune system when you've taken steroids for any period of time it
increases your risk for having a cold turn into a severe pneumonia infection also steroids can
greatly increase the risk of getting tb now 25 of the population has a latent tb infection which
means it's in their body it's in an inactive form well going on steroids can bring that out
into an active form of tb and considering that 25 of the population has it that's a lot of
people so steroids are a double-edged sword and should only be taken short-term not long-term
and very infrequent because if you're taking them chronically when you start to come off steroids
your adrenals basically have shut down and now your body can't produce it so you have all sorts
of withdrawal symptoms like osteoporosis ulcers in the stomach and also in the small intestine
severe infection diabetes weight gain like jerry lewis who had a certain autoimmune condition which
in which he had to take steroids and he just kind of blew up his whole face was like round cataracts
skin problems and the list goes on and on and so if you want an alternative to steroids there are
a couple things that you can take one human which is a potent anti-inflammatory if you're going to
take curcumin make sure you're taking at least 200 milligrams per day next one is boswellia
a very good anti-inflammatory next one is green tea a very powerful anti-inflammatory
and then number four vitamin d which is my favorite has powerful anti-inflammatory effects
you want to take at least 10,000 IUs probably 20 sometimes 30,000 IUs or more i have a bunch of
videos on that and then of course fasting which creates some very powerful anti-inflammatory
effects all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video

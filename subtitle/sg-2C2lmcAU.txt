you know i was in practice as a chiropractor for 30 years i probably personally worked on
close to 40,000 different people in that period of time i've given a lot of adjustments and i
wish i would have known back then what i know now especially when people had chronic misalignment
problems especially in the neck and specifically in the first cervical vertebra called the atlas
people would come in all the time and you have to keep readjusting them over and over and over
so in this video i'm going to talk about an interesting situation that's quite common
with a lot of people it involves the atlas what is the atlas the atlas is the first cervical vertebra
it's a vertebra like a ring and it sits right underneath the skull the entire skull sits on
this one cervical vertebra and over ninety percent of all your motion in your neck occurs from c1 so
if you can't move your neck too well to the right or left chances are it's going to be the first
cervical vertebra that's going to be involved now what's unique about this first vertebra is that
you have the brain stem extending through this vertebra as well as in the second one called the
axis so in other words part of your brain actually extends out of your skull into the first and
second vertebra and if that vertebra is misaligned you can have all sorts of issues that are related
to the brain stem your breathing can be affected you can get headaches migraine headaches tinnitus
that's ringing in the ears jaw pain you can get neck pain back pain actually lower back pain from
your neck why because it's all connected you can have a lot of lack of motion in your neck or even
in your shoulders you can become dizzy you can feel nauseated which i'm going to talk about why
and your breathing can be affected as well now when i was going through school learning about
how to become a chiropractor what happened is a lot of people practice side of you and they don't
know what the heck they're doing and so you get over adjusted and you get adjusted the wrong place
and i will tell you firsthand if you get adjusted the wrong way you're going to have issues for
example someone adjusts my neck and i ended up with a severe sinus problem it was an infection
but my nose was stuffy so over the years i've become very aware of what can happen if this
first vertebra even the second one becomes misaligned many times you won't be able to
sleep that well you also have digestive issues as well now you can actually have a whiplash injury
you can have some trauma to your head i mean even being born is traumatic someone taking
forceps on your head and twisting or pulling your head that's enough to misalign the first cervical
vertebra so if you've never had an adjustment by a very good chiropractor and you have a problem
with your neck or anything related to that first cervical vertebra having the right adjustment by a
very good chiropractor is extremely therapeutic however if someone has a chronic problem with
c1 and they have to continually get adjusted over and over and over there's something else going on
and it involves a nerve called the vagus nerve which comes out of the brain stem so if the first
cervical vertebra is misaligned that can affect the vagus nerve that goes into the digestive
system but the vagus nerve is bidirectional in other words nerves go from your gut back up
up into the brain so any problem with the gut can cause the first cervical vertebra to get tight
and even misalign so you can adjust if you feel better than the next time you eat
it's right back to the same problem now the vagus nerve is part of the autonomic nervous system
called the parasympathetic nervous system that's responsible for rest and digestion so i have found
that the solution to this chronic misalignment of the atlas is to change your food so you're no
longer bloating so you no longer have constipation when your gut is working your neck is really nice
and loose so anyway if you're new to my channel and you wanted to know what diet would be really
good for your gut i put a link down below but in general this video is for those of you who
have a lot of tightness in the upper part of the neck it's really coming from your gut so

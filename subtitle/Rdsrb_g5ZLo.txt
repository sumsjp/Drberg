so as we debug the stubborn weight we talked about energy we talk about sleep
we talked about digestion we talked about cravings we talked about stress
now we're going to talk about pain pain can really trigger the adrenals to pump
out more cortisol so pain inflammation can stop people from sleeping and losing
weight so there's a couple different things we need to know about that we
have two types we have three types of pain one is pain that's referred so
let's say for example the person had no no in no known injury yet they have
right shoulder pain then we know it's coming from the gallbladder so
gallbladder will create bloatedness over the right ribcage underneath the right
boob cage the right shoulder neck headaches this whole side right here you
can go into the hand and go right down here and then the heart will cause pain
in the mid-back right about the mid-back part that could be hard and overworking
heart or the left side through here okay left shoulder or arm that's heart so
again if they have angina or chest pain you know we need to know that okay the
digestive system down here can create a lot of neck tension a lot of headaches
blood a rubbery neck and they go to the chiropractor a thousand times it never
gets rid of it because the source is being referred so we really want to look
at is the pain is there a reason for the pain or is it just coming from somewhere
else very few people look at this and this is
not how they taught us in school sacroiliac joint pain left to right
could be the ovary lower back pain can be uterus from a huge heavy period or
prostate problems referred back so that's very very common and then you
have pain that actually occurs from an injury or you have chronic pain after an
injury then we're going to just do the acupressure on the opposite side unless
it's on the knee or the ankle will do the opposite side but we'll do the
proximal muscle the one that is a little higher up okay
so that's how we kind of clear that out for referral pain we we actually do we
get to the source we do acupressure in the gall bladder we give them nutrition
the gallbladder but then you also have systemic pain that's like pain all over
that's called fibromyalgia that's a simple thing because they're they're
losing cortisol cortisol is an anti-inflammatory so they end up with
fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis a lot of digestive Crohn's and inflammation in
the colon and that protocol you'd want to do adrenal green adrenal, adrenal
adrenal, adrenal okay okay so then we have inflammation we talked about pain
no inflammation I'm trying to summarize the most common cause of these things if
you have joint pain that's adrenal that's that's a cortisol problem if it's
gut it could also be adrenal but it could also be an imbalance in your flora
then you need a probiotic it could be a damaged lining of the gut called leaky
gut that's glue to glutamate is what they need you can do cabbage juice or
did you know that all the grass-fed products beef grass-fed cheese grass-fed
kefir yogurt that type of thing has the glutamate in it that's pretty cool cod
liver oil is great for the gut to repair it but you could also have inflammation
from fiber and food reactions the lung asthma is an inflammatory condition
sinus is an inflammatory condition if the if it's seasonal then do vitamin A
from the cod liver oil vitamin D sometimes you need bile gall bladder
formula because we're not absorbing it and then you all year-round
that's that fungus among us biofilms we talked about that xylitol garlic flush
sea salt nasal rinse that will actually handle it
and then we get all the items as bursitis tendinitis arthritis these
people need to mobilize calcium by increasing fat size of vitamins dk2
collar oil to metabolize that calcium if the person has headaches the most likely
is the gall bladder problem then the second one could be the neck from the
digestive system or just a misalignment from a car accident whatever or sinus
could cause it I mean you want to be able to think more broadly and not just
treat the head with an aspirin find the root cause because it could be menstrual
related because if it's cyclic it could be estrogen
problems because the estrogen affects the vaso then they vascular system it
could be an old injury to the head so I always ask people have you ever had any
head injuries to get oh my gosh I had four concussions I've been hit over the
head with a steel pipe well hello we just need to fix that old
injury in the skull or it could be other causes and that could be maybe have a
tumor in the brain if you've exhausted these then send them out for a cat scan
but the thing is that why start with the cat scan when you could these are the
most likely causes when you find the root problem it's always obvious okay
that's just the tip all right so that's the pain protocol

hi I'm back again so in this video I'm going to give you my beef with what the health that show
that a lot of you were talking about some people wanted me to do a little rebuttal I don't really
want to get into the background forthwith what's better vegan and meat-eater I don't want to get
into that I don't want to get into the studies back and forth that this study says this and
the study says that I just want to talk about one plank and that is this diabetes is not and
never was caused by eating a high carbohydrate diet and it's not caused by eating sugar the
cause of diabetes is a diet that builds up the amount of fat into the blood I'm talking about a
typical meat based animal-based diet so the point I disagree is that high carb diets and sugar are
not the cause of diabetes okay that's what I have a severe disagreement with because let's take a
look at what diabetes is it's a disease of high sugar in the blood hi sugar okay so you hear you
have this condition we have too much sugar in the blood and he's saying high carbs and diet sugars
don't cause it but if you add more sugar into the blood what is that going to do it's going
to worsen diabetes you talked about you talk to any diabetic and you tell them what happens if
you ate a carbohydrate rich meal it's the need for insulin is going to go up the need for medication
you have to take more medication to lower that sugar right because carb and sugar worsen diabetes
I mean that's so obvious I don't know why so people can't get it the purpose of insulin is
to lower sugar so anything that triggers more insulin and you keep stimulating hormone over
and over that's going to worsen that condition it's going to worsen that hormone let's say let's
take cortisol if you're under a lot of stress over a period of time and you have the problem
of cortisol you start getting cortisol resistance very similar to insulin resistance because there's
too much stress too much sugar is very similar to too much stress but it's going to burn out in
Flynn not cortisol the beta cells that's the cells that make in front of the pancreas wear out when
you have chronic elevation of sugar because they have to work really hard and this is just basic
physiology now why the conflicting studies you see studies with ketogenic show positive results
with the insulin resistance and diabetes then you see studies doing a vegetarian diet and you see
improvements in diabetes and insulin resistance right well I think the common denominator is very
simple they're cutting out the refined sugars yes they're doing beans and starches and vegetables
which is great but if you're doing the ketosis with a lot of vegetables and you a high fat but
you're cutting out the refined sugars you're going to see similar results so what's the
common denominator it's the refined sugars it's not the saturated fats or the meat believe the
ketogenic diet is not really high protein it's a moderate protein so that's why I think you see the
conflicting data and I think you should just look through it as they're both successful you can be a
vegan no problem you just have to know how to do it ok so now people won't ask what's my opinion
on being a vegan I have no problem with it I have a lot of patients that are vegans and you can do
it it's just a little bit more difficult because you have to get the b12 from another source and
a certain fat file vitamins like vitamin A is more difficult to get because in the vegetables
they're all pre vitamin A but you can do it you can be very healthy but I just choose to consume
animal products my body runs on it better I try to become a vegan I couldn't do it so it's really
up to you alright put your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation
quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause
of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you report

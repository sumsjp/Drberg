now it just amazes me how many people especially in the medical profession just treat constipation
as a symptom they do not look at the whole picture they might just tell you it's just a lack of fiber
just take more fiber metamucil whatever and fiber will stimulate the colon which will help
you evacuate and it's hydrating so just take some fiber that's it but constipation is the effect of
incomplete digestion anywhere in your digestive tract i mean it could be a lack of stomach acid
because stomach acid helps you break down protein if you're not breaking down protein
that can end up as undigested protein then you have the pancreas which produces
all these enzymes and enzymes really work in the small intestine you have like 20 feet of
of tubing called the small intestine which by the way your small intestine the little villi
actually make enzymes and also the pancreas releases enzymes in the small intestine and that's
where 90 of all your digestion occurs and so that doesn't occur correctly guess what undigested
food both undigested carbohydrates undigested fats undigested protein and it ends up as a
constipation situation then you have the liver that makes bile salts and it's stored by the
gallbladder and that's released into the small intestine and bile salts are the detergent that
helps break down fat to a certain level where the enzymes in the pancreas can then take over
and fully digest the fats but the thing about bile is bile lubricates the colon
bile hydrates the colon and so if you're deficient in bile you could very easily get constipation
now the problem with getting too much bile as you end up with diarrhea so you just need just
the right amount not too much not too little so after all this food is digested from the acid
from the enzymes from the bile it finally ends up into the large intestine called the colon
this is where your friendly microbes both friendly bacteria and friendly yeast take over and they
start to finalize this digestive process they will take things that you can't digest like fiber
and break those down they also help reabsorb the water as well and so if you have constipation it
could be that you need more stomach acid you need bile salts you need enzymes or you need a
good probiotic 16 of americans have constipation and 30 of americans over 60 have constipation so
it's a big deal and i really want you to take a look at the whole digestive process if you
personally have constipation rather than just one thing like adding more fiber
and so you can get a clue on the cause of constipation and what you need to do based on
when it started so let's say you started after an antibiotic well guess what you need probiotics
and by the way anytime you're on an antibiotic you should automatically take probiotics at the
same time don't wait till you're done take it at the same time you take antibiotics now let's
say for example you develop constipation when you took an antacid well then just put back the acid
betaine hydrochloride or let's say you started taking medications that have a side effect of
constipation well get with your doctor and find some alternative that doesn't have a side effect
of constipation or let's say you had a history of eating a lot of cooked foods a lot of processed
foods and no raw foods that have enzymes well then start eating raw foods like raw vegetables
or let's say there wasn't an actual time that it started but you don't like vegetables you
don't consume a lot of vegetables an average american consumes like a cup and a half of
vegetables well guess what we need that fiber for our microbes to actually live off of we also need
the potassium and magnesium in those vegetables to help the pumping action of your colon in fact
when you add more potassium magnesium that does help the bowels work correctly and a lot of times
people instead of consuming vegetables they might take epsom salts right which creates a laxative
effect and then they get diarrhea also too many high carbohydrates can interfere with the nervous
system that controls this whole process it's called the enteric part of the autonomic nervous
system so if that's the case you need something called benfotamine which is a type of b vitamin
that actually will help support that issue also frequent eating it's the cramming of all this food
down this pipe never letting the body properly digest and go through its cycle it takes 36 hours
for food to be completely processed through your entire digestive tract so if we're eating
so frequently all the time we never get a chance for your system to really clean out
another point is stress stress activates the fly to fight mechanism which inhibits
the nervous system that controls the digestion which is called the parasympathetic nervous system
so many many times you don't need to change the diet you just need to fully relax you need
to improve the parasympathetic nervous system and i put a link down below how you should do
that reducing your stress greatly improves your digestion and so a couple other tips fermented
foods are good increasing your veggies increasing more fat which will stimulate bile production
because if you're on a low fat diet that can be a reason why you don't have enough bile
and if you're in the bile things dry up and you get constipation
also lowering your carbs already mentioned that and then doing intermittent fasting is very very
important all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

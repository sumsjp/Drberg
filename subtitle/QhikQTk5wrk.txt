let's talk about preserving the anti-cancer nutrients
in certain foods now as you probably know
there are a lot of anti-cancer phytochemicals they're called
phytonutrients and cruciferous vegetables bok choy broccoli
cabbage watercress kale radish and cauliflower and there's several
additional ones as well one of the most researched
phytonutrients would be the glucosinolate in this book
right here international agency for research on
cancer okay cancer prevention this book is a
summary of all the research on the benefits of phytonutrients in
cruciferous vegetables what blows me away is that
this is completely and utterly ignored by doctors that treat cancer
i mean there's some serious research in here okay so i want to actually read to
you just one single report on this topic
that we're on the broccoli sulforaphane which is a
type of this phytonutrient was recently identified as being capable
of eliminating highly therapy resistant pancreatic
carcinoma cells without inducing toxic
side effects while sulforaphane has been shown to stimulate autophagy
or self-eating check this out pancreatic carcinoma has one of the worst
prognosis among all human malignancies and remains the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related death the large
botanical family of cruciferous vegetables and we're talking about
cauliflower broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage
mustard radish horseradish watercress wasabi is particularly rich
in glucose and late the stored form of isothiocyanate this phytonutrient
is like the inactive version this is the active version
and then you have another one sulforaphane and in order to go from
here to here there has to be an enzyme that makes it
active and the enzyme is myrocinase okay and
the way to activate that enzyme is to chop or cut your cruciferous
vegetables to chew them mash them crush them
and then let them sit for about seven minutes as this enzyme
starts to create the conversion versus cooking the hell out of these vegetables
and destroying this right here this enzyme is very
sensitive to heat so basically every minute that you cook
these you destroy more and more of the enzymes until about 10 minutes
they're all gone so if you wanted to slightly steam
or cook them a little bit chop them first
okay wait for seven minutes then cook them but just make sure you
don't overdo it the point is that once this conversion takes place and you have
the active form this phytonutrient can withstand more
heat what the heat destroys is the enzyme
that converts these two and it just actually blows me away of how many
benefits for your health that the active form of these
phytonutrients can create for you neutralizing cancer
apoptosis this is when the cancer cell commits suicide
it inhibits tumor growth decreases inflammation and the list goes
on and on and on i hope you got that if you want more
information about cruciferous and the benefits that it can create
I put it right here

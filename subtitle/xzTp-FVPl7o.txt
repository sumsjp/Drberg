so let's talk about the best food for
gallstones
what causes gallstones it's a situation
where you have
supersaturated cholesterol that's
forming a stone
but just because you have high
cholesterol does not
mean that you're going to get a stone
has to have another situation occurring
which is this
low amounts of bile salts if you have a
bile deficiency
and a super concentrated amount of
cholesterol that's when you get the
stone
we could reword this as the best foods
for increasing
bile production okay primary bile salts
are made by your liver
and then you have secondary bile salts
made by your
microbes so you need friendly bacteria
to also make bile not just a healthy
liver but
enough bacteria there's a lot of natural
things that can help you
increase bile as far as supplements goes
to reduce stones
one is choline you can get that in a
supplement
it just so happens that butter grass-fed
butter
has choline in it okay so that's one of
the things that can
help you to a certain degree and just
because i'm talking about butter i'll
talk about it right now
a certain amount of that butter is
easier to digest because it doesn't have
to go through
all the steps of digestion i don't want
to get into the mechanism of that
all you need to know is that grass-fed
butter does have some choline that can
help you
but also the grass-fed butter being a
fat
a saturated fat can actually trigger
the liver to make more bile as compared
to people that are on a low-fat diet
they are at a higher risk for getting a
gallstone
simply because they're not triggering
the liver
to make more bile so they're bile
deficient and they end up with the
gallstones not
necessarily people that are consuming
more fat
now just taking purified bile salts
are very important if you have gall
stones because that has been known
and used even by the medical community
to help dissolve stones if you want more
information i put a link down below
also omega-3 fatty acids as a supplement
or in certain foods
can help reduce the risk of stones
but the foods that can help reduce
gallstones
would be the bitter vegetables artichoke
is at the top of the list it helps
your body make more bile enzyme
very important in increasing bile
production okra
and beet tops okay very very bitter
but it also has other things like
choline that can help reduce the risk of
getting gallstones
cruciferous vegetables okay
dandelion greens great for the liver
anything that supports liver health or
liver regeneration
will help the production of bile
thus these vegetables right here and we
already mentioned grass-fed butter
apple cider vinegar is good for the
liver and it can
actually help digestion it also helps
stimulate the release of bile from the
liver because
in the digestive process when you eat
and the acid is triggered
that acid sends a signal to the liver to
start releasing bile
and if you have low amounts of acid in
your stomach that could be another
reason why you're not releasing the bile
as well
you may have heartburn or gerd acid
reflux
or definitely indigestion that's that's
probably the
top symptom lemon and lime
can also help increase bowel production
now on the flip side there are certain
things that will cause stones like
high amounts of cortisol so you'd want
to lower cortisol that comes from stress
as well as taking a cortisol medication
as in prednisone
cortisone shots that can increase the
risk of getting stones
high levels of insulin from doing high
amounts of
carbs and frequent eating can actually
cause
stones so you want to lower the insulin
doing the keto diet and intermittent
fasting
estrogen has the capacity to create
stones
and that's one reason why women that are
pregnant have a higher incidence of
getting a stone
as well as women that are on birth
control pills
or estrogen therapy they tend to get
more stones
and then we have a person that's on a
low fat high high-protein
type diet some of those powdered
high-protein low-fat soy protein
isolate type products to help you lose
weight are very very hard on the liver
and that seems to increase the risk of
getting gallstones and then the
other thing that's very bad for the
liver that creates inflammation that
creates insulin resistance
is vegetable oils or seed oils so you
want to avoid
the corn oils the soy oil the canola oil
the cottonseed oils for sure all right
guys i created a lot of videos on the
gallbladder if you haven't seen them i
put a few
good ones up here check them out

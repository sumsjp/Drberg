you feel like you're gaining too much weight because you're eating too many nuts
that definitely might be a possibility at first people might think well nuts are keto
friendly they're high in protein fat and low in carbs right well not all nuts are low in carbs
now on keto you want to aim for between 20 and 50 grams of carbs per day in fact the more
you want to lose weight the slower the metabolism the lower you want to target your carbs for
but check this out let's just take peanuts for example and peanuts are definitely something
that are very easy to overdo just one cup of peanuts which isn't that much is about 146 grams
comes out to 24 grams of carbs right so that's just 24 grams so if you're trying to
shoot for 20 grams you've already exceeded that 20 gram carbs per day limit and don't forget all
the other food that you eat there might be carbs in that as well so peanuts and then peanut butter
one cup it's 258 grams that's 50 grams of carbs okay so let's say you're doing the celery like
i just did a video on celery and peanut butter and you're you're dishing this thing out if you
buy these containers of peanut butter sometimes they're about 16 ounces
so half of that is one cup eight ounces it's actually not hard to do half of that and that's
50 grams of carbs okay pistachios another real easy nut to overdo one cup is about 146 grams
i mean you just say dinner you're having some pistachios and pretty soon you've just done
three cups well one cup is 35 grams okay all right almonds much better one cup is 146 grams
it's only 14 grams of carbs okay so i mean you could definitely overdue almonds as well almond
butter is much better than peanut butter but it is high in oxalates so if you have a tendency to have
kidney stones not a good idea but almonds one cup 258 grams is about 21 grams of carbs pecans
are a much better nut as far as low carbs i like pecans better than other nuts
one cup 146 grams only four grams of carbs so watch consuming too many nuts if you want to

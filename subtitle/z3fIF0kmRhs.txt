the most common cause of hypoglycemia what is hypoglycemia low blood sugar okay what are the
symptoms dizziness cravings for sugar lightheadedness sweating lethargy and
being irritable now the simple version of how they diagnose this is if you're a diabetic and you have
blood sugars less than 70 milligrams per deciliter you can have hypoglycemia now if you're not a
diabetic and you're an adult if your blood sugars are less than 50 milligrams per deciliter you can
have hypoglycemia now one type of hypoglycemia is called idiopathic hypoglycemia okay now idiopathic
means unknown cause so basically they're labeling this hypoglycemia we don't know
what causes it so it's a nice descriptive term another form of hypoglycemia is called idiopathic
postpranial syndrome okay now that's a fancy word for describing low blood sugar symptoms without
actually having low blood sugar okay and of course the word idiopathic they don't know what causes it
and then the other um diagnosis that sometimes people get is that it's hypoglycemia caused from
adrenal fatigue okay because the adrenal hormones specifically cortisol and adrenaline are counter
regulatory hormones so if your blood sugars are too low they will raise your blood sugars up so
they kind of protect you against hypoglycemia but you know i've done videos on this and i've talked
about how the adrenals can cause hypoglycemia but i really don't think that's the main cause because
if you were to have hypoglycemia and you were to focus on fixing your adrenals you're usually
not going to see improvement in your blood sugars okay they're not going to actually
come up to normal so i think it can happen but you would have to really have an adrenal gland problem
where it's completely like shut down where you might have a condition called addison's disease
where the adrenal just doesn't work anymore the number one cause of hypoglycemia is hyper insulin
anemic hypoglycemia it's a fancy term for you have high insulin and low blood sugar now if
you look up the cause of this it'll say insulin injections okay if you're a diabetic type one
tumors okay autoimmune certain drugs especially diabetic drugs and prednisone too and genetics
but what they're missing is the big reason why you have hyper insulin okay and that's excessive carbs
it's amazing the number one cause for high insulin is not even mentioned okay hardly anywhere
when you look this up here's what happens large quantities of carbohydrates will then elevate your
blood sugars at a certain level and your body's going to then require large amounts of insulin
to come in there to push your blood sugars down and if it's too much force you're going to end
up with low blood sugars hypoglycemia all right now we give this more time and we keep eating a
large amount of carbohydrates an average person in america consumes like 65 of their calories in the
form of carbohydrates so a lot of people are doing this so if you do this over a long period of time
the body is going to protect itself by developing insulin resistance so now we have a situation
where the cells are not taking in insulin okay that alone is gonna jack up insulin more
at the same time you're consuming the same amount of carbohydrates you're getting so much insulin
coming in and the body is compensating for there is this resistance so you may have normal blood
sugars but you may have lower blood sugars because of all this insulin pushing things down and what
is the main treatment for hypoglycemia dextrose pills okay sugar pills so you're basically going
to add more carbohydrates to fix your low blood sugar wow whoever is doing that doesn't understand
this mechanism at all now with more time the pancreas is going to go you know what i can't keep
making all this insulin and the beta cells that make insulin are just going to get exhausted
they're going to get tired and they're going to retire and go to sleep and not work that much so
now we have less insulin and now the blood sugars go up because there's nothing to push it down
and this is called pre-diabetes and actual diabetes so that's the different phases of
what happens when you start doing more carbs end up with hypoglycemia and end up with hyperglycemia
what do you need to do if you're new to my channel i put the link down below just follow the eating
plan and it can greatly help you hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

all right so in this video we're going
to talk about shrinking testicles and
man boobs okay now there's a condition
called hypogonadism where you have
atrophy of your gonads your testicles
and that actually comes from liver
damage
whether it's a fatty liver maybe an
inflamed liver which reduces the
function
or more commonly a liver that's
filled with scar tissue that's cirrhosis
now
when you have a damaged liver
you inhibit the receptors for growth
hormone
growth hormone is made by the pituitary
it's sent down to the liver
and then it triggers another hormone
called igf number one
that is basically made by the liver and
you're going to have an inability for
that growth hormone to connect
to the liver because the receptors are
not receiving
and also you're going to have a less
production of igf-1 in general
and that is going to reduce testosterone
because
igf normally stimulates testosterone
production
and when testosterone goes down you have
a spike
in estrogen okay
now there's been studies that they've
actually injected igf in men to reverse
testicular atrophy okay at least short
term
so we can see this effect of igf on
testosterone
but that comes with a package there's
other side effects also
alcohol increases the toxicity of the
gonads as well
i think because if there's liver damage
you can't you don't have the enzymes to
detoxify
alcohol like you should and that builds
up toxicity
so when you have a reduction of
testosterone you have loss of libido
you're impotent you have feminizing
effects like man boobs
and a reduction in sperm okay and you
also have the androgens in your body not
just in the liver but to the entire body
being converted over to estrogen through
a certain
enzyme all right so what is the solution
do you take certain herbs to stimulate
the production of testosterone or maybe
testosterone
replacement therapy well what about just
fixing the liver
okay that gets to the root because every
time you
uh take a hormone for example
your body will then not have to produce
so that
creates more hypogonadism so how do we
repair the liver okay well the liver is
unique and then it has
amazing reparative properties okay it
can bounce back
if you know what to do now in this
situation where you have your actual
testosterone being converted to estrogen
you can take an enzyme blocker
and and that would be like stinging
nettle root that would be one
so stinging nettle root is a really good
inhibitor of aromatase and this will
stop this production of estrogen in the
body now the next thing to consider
is time a lot of times people in their
mind think it's going to be a two-week
process so the liver is a very large
organ so it does take time
so you're just going to have to have
patience and realize that
the time it takes to repair the liver it
could be a few years okay so
i don't want to set you up for this this
idea that oh yeah it's going to be
two weeks and it's going to be cured and
everything's going to be fine it takes
quite a bit of time all right second
point we want to
stop the things that are causing the
problem in the first place
and yes that does include alcohol
alcohol is going to worsen the problem
in the liver
you're going to have to put that on hold
right now if you want a good substitute
i recommend
kombucha tea make sure the sugar is
really really low
you also want to avoid junk food and you
want to
increase the quality of food organic
meats organic vegetables because all
those pesticides
and chemicals make things worse now you
may have been watching my other videos
and you know about keto but if you don't
i put a link down below
you need to get on a healthy version of
the ketogenic diet
that way we can reduce the carbs in the
sugar
reduce the stress and start repairing
the liver not to mention help to take
the fat off the liver as well
all right the next point is choline
choline is a very essential nutrient
to help take the fat off of a liver it
has
properties of improving liver function
it does a lot for the liver
so you want to get a good choline
supplement and start taking that
as well as vitamin e and vitamin d
get vitamin d3 and as far as the vitamin
e goes
make sure you get a nice food
concentrate something that has a
combination of
tocotrinols and tocopherols not a
synthetic version
of vitamin e vitamin e is very
protective of the liver
and vitamin d3 is also beneficial to the
liver as well
now phytonutrients that come from leafy
greens and cruciferous vegetables are
chemoprotective so they do have certain
compounds that are not just anti-cancer
but they're also good to support the
detoxification enzymes
it does a lot for the liver so a lot of
leafy greens would be very beneficial
and then number five good amount of
exercise exercise can actually really
increase the blood flow
and also it helps stimulate growth
hormone as well
and by the way this next thing
intermittent fasting is
probably one of the most powerful things
you can do for the liver because
it can actually increase uh growth
hormone and if you have scar tissue in
the liver
or cirrhosis it can help repair that
through an action called
atapa g i put a link down below for more
information about that
so if we do the intermittent fasting
correctly on top
of all these we can repair the liver
function and start to regain
the testosterone by improving the actual
function of the gland itself
so we target the cause of this problem
to improve the many
downstream consequences that this will
create
all right thanks for watching hey guys
real quick i have a new
healthy keto eating plan for you just go

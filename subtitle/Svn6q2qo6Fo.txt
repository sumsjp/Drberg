hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you why you can't lose the
weight okay every single time that I ask a person why do you want to lose weight
they always tell me to feel better well the strategy is backwards because
it violates the law of losing weight of getting healthy to lose weight
not lose weight to get healthy so your goal has to include as a first step and
this is a way better strategy is to feel healthy first and what does that mean
that means having tons of energy having a high tolerance for stress having a
relaxed body no stress having no cravings okay no bloating
no pain no menstrual cycle pain that's actually feeling healthy that's the
definition so if you were just to focus your energy on that one thing the weight
loss would come off as a byproduct because the weight is a symptom it's not
a cause of anything it's a symptom of something else so if you try to lose
weight on off on top of fatigue on top of cravings stress heavy bloating
menstruation no sleeping good luck that is not going to happen it's going to be
rough it's going to be tough but all these programs that are out there they
don't take in consideration getting healthy first it's a great strategy it's
so simple and it really works I will guarantee that if you do this it will
work because the people that get them in a situation where they're feeling better
they always lose weight always but the reason why like if someone comes up to
me and he said well I can't lose weight what should I do dr. Berg well I'll ask
him how was your energy how was your sleep how was your stress tolerance
how's the cravings this is a little secret little checklist I used if any of
these things I fix any one of these things and all of a sudden I start
losing weight because the first that they have to feel is more energy
better before they start losing weight so what I want you to do is is take this
whole weight thing and just put it way way over here stick it in the garbage
can right now it's not the right target focus on feeling healthy first and the
weight will follow I promise

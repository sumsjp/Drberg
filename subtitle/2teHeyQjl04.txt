so i have a question would you eat one of these every single week
well chances are you are already an average person consumes about five grams of plastic every single
week that's 1769 particles of micro plastics which is very very small pieces of plastic
there's a very interesting study which i'll put a link down below from the university of newcastle
australia which talks about how much plastics we're consuming through our food through our drink
through our air number one source is bottled water now if you consume a lot of bottled water
you can literally add about 90,000 more plastic particles on addition to this so it's a lot of
plastics in our bodies that tend to accumulate over time the second source
would be tap water because of the things that are put into the oceans and the lakes
number three shellfish due to the plastics in the oceans number four beer number five salt
where does salt come from the ocean there's also plastics in your toothpaste
it's all over the place as well as even in artificial clothing polyester nylon there's
over 330 million metric tons of plastic injected into our environments every single year which can
create a lot of negative effects on your health including increasing your estrogen levels way
too high i'll put a link down below on some videos that i did on that topic so what is the solution
well get a water filter at your house number two buy non-synthetic clothing
like organic cotton things like that number three don't microwave with plastics
number four fasting fasting increases your ability to detoxify plastics from the body it's
called phase 1 phase 2 detoxification so this can help you right here also cruciferous vegetables
increase this phase one phase two detoxification in your liver also in your kidney and your skin
and your brain many different tissues can actually perform that function sami is a good supplement to
help detoxification as well as nac so in summary this is just another video on increasing your
awareness on certain toxicities that you may not realize that you're being exposed to hey before

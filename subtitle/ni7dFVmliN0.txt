hey guys so I'm gonna talk about GERD and what I would recommend there's two
things that you need to do number one you want to acidify the stomach okay
what happens with GERD is you have the top of the valve that's not closing it
properly and you're getting acid that's going up into the esophagus one of the
reasons for that is that your stomach is not acid enough and so I would recommend
the combination of apple cider vinegar and or betaine hydrochloride I put a
video down below for more information of why that will help you but that will
close the valve on the top part of the stomach the next thing I'm going to
recommend is a simple acupressure point and this is a highly effective and you
should just try this okay so we're looking right here at the bottom of your
sternum there's a little piece of cartilage that's right down there you
don't want to press on that but right at the bottom of the sternum right here and
here are the two ribs right through in here okay so and then you have the
stomach right in the center okay so what you're going to do is you're going to
take your hand and you're going to massage and you can use a massage tool
up into this area right here at this angle and you're going to massage all
through this area you're going to find a lot of tension and it might be very
uncomfortable some glow very light what you're trying to do is kind of take some
of the nuts and the tension out of this area and create more space so you do
this side and you do the other side right through and here and you're
basically just pressing up in there and massaging what you're gonna find is when
you do this you're going to take a lot of stress off the digestive system
you're gonna actually help the tone of the stomach and for many people that do
this you're going to find a great reduction in GERD symptoms I would do
this several times a day for a week and then make sure that your meals you're
consuming outside of vinegar and betaine how to chloride you can find them both
in a pill form and you're probably going to need between four and five of those
right before you eat thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all

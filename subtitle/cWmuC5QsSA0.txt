hi guys I wanted to create a quick video on menstrual cramp relief what you should take to
get some quick relief if you have cramps number one b1 take vitamin b1 I would try to find a
natural one you can do nutritional yeast or find a natural version of vitamin B1 and then vitamin b6
both of those are great for cramps and then add some calcium magnesium ok it's real simple very
inexpensive remedy but this will give you a lots of relief thanks for watching hi guys listen I
created an evaluation quiz it is quite long it's a hundred for questions but it's very thorough click
the link below and take it and it will help you to find out what's really behind all your symptoms

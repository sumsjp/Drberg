there are certain ingredients that we still eat despite being banned in certain countries so let's
take it from the top number one there are certain dough conditioners which are certain chemicals
that give dough a certain texture i'm talking about the dough that you would make in bread
specifically potassium bromate now potassium bromate is banned in india it's banned in
brazil canada the european union and even china but it's still being allowed in the u.s despite
being a possible human carcinogen all right number two brominate vegetable oil now this was patented
as a flame retardant but it's being used in those colorful sport drinks as an emulsifier
now this was banned in japan but not a lot of other countries and it too is a carcinogen as
well as being linked to organ failure then we get to number three propyl paraben now this is
that wonderful preservative in tortillas it's in muffins certain pies and it's been linked to a lot
of problems with sexual organs now it's legal in the u.s but it's banned in europe then we get to
the chemical bha and bht this is one of the preservatives they used in cereals and dehydrating
potato products it's banned in the uk as well as the european union but it's not banned in the
u.s and number five we have the gmo glyphosate this is the herbicide they spray on the soy the
sugar beets the corn the canola the cotton and the alfalfa many european countries have banned
this herbicide but surprise is not banned in the u.s the company bear who bought out monsanto

you know exercise is good for a lot of different things um but it's actually very good
to prevent the shrinkage of your brain as you get older now there was a study that i'm going to put
down below that was based on 120 older adults doing aerobic exercise randomize control study
and this is what they found they found there was an increase in the volume that's the front part of
your hippocampus now what is the hippocampus this is the part of the brain that is in control of
spatial navigation or spatial memory your ability to remember locations and understand where you are
in relationship to something else so if they put you in one of those mazes that they have
you're going to have a heck of a time trying to find your way out of that so certain birds
that fly south during the winter have huge hippocampus structures to allow them to navigate
so that's one tiny thing that the hippocampus does but it does other things too related to
memory also exercise will increase blood flow to your hippocampus now the hippocampus
is one of the few areas of the brain that can regenerate most of the brain cannot regenerate
but the hippocampus can and that's involved with memory so that's the good news all right and then
we have an increase in bdnf in the hippocampus it stands for brain-derived neurotrophic
factors and that's the thing that helps regrow the brain and exercise will stimulate that
in the hippocampus exercise will also increase the volume of the prefrontal cortex
okay that's involved in decision making and thinking so exercise can help you with that
all right so now what shrinks the brain age stress and having high blood sugars so in this video my
intention is just to make you aware that exercise can prevent the loss of volume of your brain and
if you combine exercise with intermittent fasting and a vitamin b1 from nutritional yeast i think
you'll have a really good plan to keep your brain at the size it needs to be as you age hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on
this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your
immune system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so
you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune
system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

[Music]
there are people that exercise seven
days a week
work out two hours a day and still
cannot lose even an ounce so the
question is why what makes someone be
able to lose weight and other people
cannot today we're going to talk about
that
if you look around you're going to
notice that most people fall into one of
four body shapes some people hold a
weight in the stomach as a sagging belly
some people as a protruded
some people hold their weight in the
saddlebag hip area and the arms yet
other people will be big everywhere
so i developed the body type system of
weight loss and today we're going to
talk about what's behind that because if
there's something going on inside your
body that's off or out of balance
the outside is going to be shaped
differently
and there's nothing worse than doing all
this work and not getting results i mean
there are people that
they just keep failing and failing and
failing it's not that they're crazy or
lazy or have low willpower it's they're
not getting results so today's about
getting to the root and what's very
interesting is you don't really have a
weight problem
i know it sounds weird some of you are
like have you seen me in the mirror you
have a weight symptom
it's really a hormone problem or a slow
metabolism
but let's talk about hormones because
there's a lot of confusion i had a lady
who said i don't need to come to your
seminar dr bird because i had all my
hormones removed
you you have 600 hormones in your body
we're going to cover each one of them
today i hope you have a notebook now
we're not going to cover all this
but the ones we're going to talk about
are the fat burning hormones but let's
just define what a hormone is i need a
volunteer
how about you
great once you stand right here
she's like do i have to just go in this
front row
and i need another volunteer yeah how
about you
so you can just stand right here okay so
you're gonna be the fat cell
okay you're gonna be the thyroid gland
okay okay
so now thyroid
um and you're gonna communicate i'm
gonna just put your fingers in your ear
just pretend like you can't hear me okay
okay good so now thyroid say hello to
the fat cell
hello
okay say burn fat
burn fat
okay now do you have any kids
three have you ever talked to a child he
ignored you the first time
what do you do
say it again okay good
burn fat
do you actually increase the volume too
yeah yeah
burn fat okay after a while her face is
going to get red
so hormones are the communication sent
across the distance over here and it's
supposed to connect into two little
holes they're called receptors hormones
are communications they have millions of
functions but the one we're talking
about is the fat burning hormone so we
have the gland that makes the hormone it
gets sent to the bloodstream it gets
received and it's supposed to burn fat
most people this is what's going on the
communication is being sent but it's not
being listened to
so that's why
they keep gaining weight so thank you
very much
and thank you very
much see
now that you understand hormones let's
go into the first body type which which
is the thyroid gland
now the thyroid is this body type right
here where you gain weight all over
equally not in any one location now your
thyroid is located right in the base of
your neck right here just put your
fingers on your thyroid
lower yeah right there it's about two
and a half inches wide it comes from the
latin word which means shield
thyroid because it looks like a little
shield
looks like this
okay
now
if the thyroid is not working you're
going to start developing
too much
what is called
potential
energy
what's another name for a potential
energy
fat very good
how many feel like you have too much
potential energy
it sounds better doesn't it there's a
better ring to it we're going to get a
t-shirt i'm not fat at potential energy
so
that's what it is so fat
how many of you be honest don't like
your fat
yeah
now
why does your body make it
if it just makes you miserable
does it have a purpose
like maybe people think it's a cushion
or an insulator to sit down
no
it's a survival mechanism
in other words
it is developed on the evolutionary
chain of survival so it helps you
against it protects against starvation
famine and stress
so your body has stored fat to help you
so now you have a different viewpoint
that's trying to help you right but the
question is how do we get rid of it
right if we have too much
well
what do most people do they go on a diet
what do what do they do what's a diet
it's a starvation
hello
so what's going to happen the more they
diet the more they starve themselves the
more they cut calories the more they
count calories portion control
everything in moderation you end up
creating
more potential energy the exact thing
you're trying to get rid of so the
things that people do to lose weight are
the things that are ruining the
metabolism
so with a thyroid you'll have problems
with excess weight because the thyroid
goes into every single cell in the body
you're going to every weight your cell
is going to expand and get bigger that's
why you're big equally everywhere
now the first symptom of a thyroid would
be
cravings to
carbohydrates
okay
starches
breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits
waffles pancakes muffins sodas
juice alcohol mad dog 20 20.
all of those things are carbohydrates
now
how many of you ever ate something that
you know you shouldn't have eaten at
least once before
got one two three four five six
how do people justify it when they eat
something bad
everything in moderation
i deserve it that's a good one
people are starving in russia
you've got to eat everything on your
plate
just a little bit
i'll drink more water to flush it out
you can't be perfect all the time
so when you do something like that
what happens is you end up
you have to make it okay so you invent a
reason for eating that thing
and so it stacks up
um i went to i was at uh the health food
store and i was shopping and i saw one
of my clients um and she was um i was
just watching i was by the salad bar
looking through the glass and i saw her
over there by the red section
and she kept going close to this little
um
brownie tray
i was just watching to see if she was
going to get in
and she would go closer and then she
would back up and
she'd look back and come back here and
then eventually she before she grabbed
it she looked looked left and right and
she ate it
and then she looked right up and we
connected eyes
her face turned white as a ghost
and she just went with a shop card this
way
so
i ran after her
and i'm saying i'm like listen
it's okay
just relax
because if i didn't if i didn't talk to
her make it okay she would just i would
never see her again
so people tend to hide those little
secrets with cheating and stuff
it's okay to cheat as long as you tell
me
don't keep a secret just get it out
because all we have to do is we have to
find out why you're craving but if you
have a thyroid problem you're going to
crave the
the pleasure foods
breads potato starch rice okay uh
sourdough bread out of the oven with
butter
okay they like that for some reason
so um they crave carbohydrates
they have problems with their hair the
hair starts getting thinner
brittle
they they lose their hair and they comb
it because those are proteins they have
problems with their nails they get
vertically ridged nails those are up and
down ridges on the nails
okay let's see what we got here oh you
got yours polished there
oh okay so can you call 9-1-1 please
so the ridges the nails could mean
thyroid the problem with the thyroid
you'll have loose um skin right here
right here
how many of you know anyone like that
maybe like a co-worker or a relative a
neighbor
yeah someone else
so we have a thin skin dry hair
you lose your eyebrows on the outer part
right here first that would be thyroid
thyroid cases have cold feet
they throw socks to bed
someone told me doesn't everyone i go no
that's not normal
so they have a temperature problem
so they have problems they're they're
tired
they they could sleep for many many
hours but there's they don't feel
refreshed when they get up
okay
so that would be thyroid any question
about the thyroid
thyroid
cases do not absorb vitamins too well
okay
so vitamins
because the metabolism is so low they
don't break those things down
there's over a hundred intracellular
enzymes those are those little chemicals
in the body that break stuff down that
are get shut down with the thyroid so
it's very expensive urine to be taking
all these vitamins because it's going to
go right through you
so
let's just talk as a side note not only
is it a problem with absorption of
vitamins
that but most vitamins are made
synthetically
now let's just show you something in
nature
vitamins always come in complexes
ascorbic acid is one part of the vitamin
c complex
okay it's just the antioxidant its
purpose is to protect the real good
stuff which is vitamin j
p k and copper these are this is a
natural vitamin c complex that comes in
nature this is synthetic right here
which is ascorbic acid
what's very interesting about
that is that this comes from corn starch
and sulfuric acid that's how they make
ascorbic acid there's no vitamin c in
corn
yet they're making
vitamin c when it's artificial though
when you take ascorbic acid in large
quantities which mainly you'll see in
synthetic over 500 milligrams in these
pills which if it was natural be the
size of a golf ball
and as a pill when you take too much of
this it will create deficiencies
of these other parts
it will literally create a vitamin c
deficiency i had a guy he went to mexico
and he was going to cancer therapy and
he took all this 100 000 milligrams of
injected vitamin c but it was really
ascorbic acid he ended up with bleeding
gums that's a sign of vitamin c
deficiency
varicose veins spider veins hemorrhoids
and extreme fatigue that's all the signs
of scurvy
so
you always want to look on the back of
label and be able to read the label to
see if it's real like comes from actual
plants you don't want to
have to pronounce like can't pronounce
these chemicals okay so most vitamins
are made synthetically
99 and even the most popular ones which
i'm not going to mention any of those
vitamins names okay centrum silver
but what happens is that there's another
one called calcium
carbonate that's a mineral
that's sold
as
a
calcium supplement right
calcium carbonate is limestone it's not
it's like it's like a rock you'd be
better off chewing on the cement out
there than you would taking that vitamin
so when you take your vitamin and you
feel this heavy bottle
it's like a paper weight it's just
mainly calcium carbonate which is
limestone
it's not going to be absorbed it's just
going to it's going to cause kidney
stones
so read the labels make sure the
vitamins and minerals come from plants
that you can pronounce
not synthetics most vitamins or minerals
are made from metals or rocks
or salts
which don't really get absorbed so
there's a big difference when people say
there's no difference there's a big
difference and then compound that the
fact that you have a thyroid case you
can't absorb anything no wonder we have
that the vitamins that you take aren't
really working
okay now the next body type we're going
to talk about
is going to be called
the adrenal
now the adrenal gland
sits on top of the kidney right here
you've got two of them go ahead and put
your fingers on your adrenals
now the adrenal gland is a stress gland
how many ever experienced stress before
got one two three four five six give me
an example of what stresses people out
work traffic children
kids
husbands
being overweight school
relationships
life
finances
wow you guys can relate to that
um how many have ever had a stressful
relationship before at least once
twice
okay we'll stop right there
um so the adrenal reacts and adapts the
body to stress so if you pretend like
you're being chased by a tiger for the
next 10 years and how your body would
react to that that's what happens with
the adrenals over time when it burns out
well if you're being chased by a tiger
you're not going to be able to sleep
okay you're not going to be able to
reproduce so you're going to have
problems with hormones reproductive
hormones you're going to problems with
digestion you're getting problems with
blood pressure and cholesterol and all
these other things with blood sugars
because you're running on sugar
so i'm going to go through all of them
but the adrenals regulate stress and
stress does accumulate
yes you're like a bucket
and you filled up in fact there is
always some stress
that has occurred
right before you started developing a
stubborn weight issue
always if you ask a person they think
it's just calories right well if you
take it back when did you start gaining
weight what happened just before that
you're going to find that they had a
baby
c-section a surgery a hysterectomy tubal
ligation they got married they got a
divorce
on that same day
now they have just a lot of different
stresses i've had people even as kids be
be overweight and many times it comes
after an asthma attack or an ear
infection or a throat infection so many
things that can stress the body out but
stress does accumulate and over time you
develop too many applications on your
desktop computer which is your body
so all these things accumulate and
you're just like a bucket of stress
you're kind some people when we measure
the inside of you are so jacked up they
can't sleep they can't relax
so i would say
probably the biggest thing that stresses
people out are other people
is that true
there's certain personality types that
kind of get to you you got the whiner
right
they're like um will you please help me
will you please help me do they ever
accept your help
no
you just want to help you just want to
like okay let me push you downstairs now
you want my help
so
it's like you have winders you have the
antagonistic person who's rude
you have the real depressed person that
brings you down you'll give them a
solution they say no that will never
work
or you have those really happy people
that are always this happy
that doesn't stress me out but sometimes
it's like if you're depressed you don't
really like these happy people they're
just too positive all the time
but there's one personality type that
really gets on my nerves and they call
it the um passive aggressive
called underminers
now let me show you what they what they
look like so everyone look at me very
very
hostile right now
you're smiling
look at me very mean
okay now smile
hi
nice to meet you
they're gonna backstab you
to your face they told you they stood up
for you but they actually ruin your
reputation they love gossip
how many of you know anyone like that
they give you a compliment but they
follow it up with a sharp critical
comment
they'll say something like hey that's a
nice jacket
was it on sale
i'm like who would ever say that it's
like oh that's a nice haircut did you
get at cheap cuts
my uncle i mean um
actually yes it was my uncle um he goes
uh congratulations you graduated as a
chiropractor congratulations hey why
don't you want to become a real doctor
so
you have people that are bringing you up
and people are bringing you down right
so those people they bring you down
covertly
so they're very introverting they'll
they'll do something like this are you
feeling okay you look really tired are
you sick and you're like i was fine
until you said that
so i do have a way of getting back at
these people
if you'd like to know about that anyone
want to know the technique
okay just reverse the flow
just do back to them
have you has that been growing for a
while
you don't have anything in your face
they'll be in the bathroom for hours
looking at their face going is there
anything on here because they're
introverting you so
yeah okay so let's move on to something
less stressful
but if you're in a relationship like
that or someone's
connected and you're trying to reason
with them
don't hold your breath
you can't reason with them that's what
frustrates you because you just want to
get them to see can't you see that
you're crazy no they're not going to see
that
they have to be right
they'd rather be right than successful
so you're just better off just
ignoring them okay
so adrenal when the adrenal gland gets
burnt out your tolerance or stress goes
down you don't tolerate
people anymore people get on your nerves
you become edgy
especially incompetent people
people that make mistakes you kind of
like you might react more than you
should right
you're not going crazy okay
it's the adrenals because the tolerance
of stress your ability to tolerate
stress stuff
this kind of buffers it so sometimes
that buffer goes down and you're and
you're just kind of on edge all the time
um the way you think it's not linear
it's like popcorn thoughts just come in
there like this
your memory starts
the adrenal affects the gps in the brain
so it's kind of like you're going
downstairs you're like um
what am i looking for again
i've got to backtrack
okay um you'll be talking to someone but
you're actually
having another conversation in your head
you might be waiting for the person to
stop talking so you can talk because
you're kind of thinking too fast it's
going too fast what you're doing you're
solving problems 24 7 you can't stop
solving problems in fact you can't stop
thinking
so with adrenal they do a lot of
thinking
and
because they're in a survival mode it's
called flight or fight mode
that is uh the problem with that is it
stirs up the adrenals even more what
they should be doing is just turn it off
for at least i don't know like a half
hour a day go for a walk
look at a tree a bird a cloud and just
get space don't get the headphones on
and you know look at your computer all
the time how many of you sit in front of
a computer more than uh five hours a day
16 hours a day
wow um that what happens is that it
really kind of the computers and
everything kind of will stress your body
too especially if you have the computer
right next to your body i would try to
get as far away as possible
and even when you go to sleep at night
make sure there's no electrical stuff
right by your head
you got cell phones you know all that
stuff i i'm very sensitive to um
energies and i can pick up like i don't
like talking in that cell phone somehow
it just like feels like there's a
microwave in my brain so i'm like okay i
gotta go you know just that's why
everyone's like what's your cell phone
number i never pick it up
because i don't like that cell phone
so
the adrenal when the adrenal gets
stressed
you can't tolerate stress and you start
increasing hormones that are going to
cause belly fat all right so this is an
adrenal body type shape right here the
weight is right there now why is it in
the belly
primarily
because your body's in survival and as a
stress mechanism you're going to hold it
around the most important organs which
happen to be in your midsection
your body's trying to survive it's
trying to help you
it's protecting you against starvation
that low calorie diet that you're going
to go on yeah so it's like going to put
it right here how many sit ups will it
take to flatten that belly
it's not going to happen why because
it's coming from a hormone
your problem is not your weight it's
your hormones
you have to reduce that cortisol the
things that people do to lose weight end
up destroying their metabolism and their
hormones we don't want to jack that up
anymore so people take stimulants
you're already stimulated you don't want
to jack it up more
so it goes there now over time
instead of burning the belly fat off as
energy it's going to burn off
your leg muscles before it even touches
that fat in other words your body is
going to use up your proteins and your
your thighs
so guess what that's connected to your
knees that's why you have a lot of knee
problems with with adrenal and you have
a lot of collagen because all the glue
that holds the body together falls apart
so you have loose skin
it's called pendulous abdomen it kind of
sags right here and when you get it from
a seated position you're kind of like
getting up climbing is a problem your
legs are heavier
don't worry it gets worse
so after these legs become dissolved
then your adrenals will go after another
muscle called the glutamus maximus what
muscle is that
you're behind
so
so what happens is not only do we get us
thinner legs and bigger trunk
but we get no butt
so you got no butt no legs all belly
you've seen people like that right so
you have something to look forward to
i'm just gonna
i'm telling you you gotta you have to um
you gotta start now
just preventing okay um i've had
relatives that before menopause oh my
goodness waste like this after like that
so
yeah
so adrenal
glands will cause all sorts of problems
with stress responses and it affects
their ability to sleep
normally when you go to sleep at night
you're supposed to go through four waves
of sleep
from a light sleep here to a deep sleep
here
now down here
in the lower parts this is called the
delta wave sleep right here
that's where you burn 98 of all your fat
not during the day
all the fat burning occurs right there
if you're not sleeping you're not going
to burn fat but in your mind you're
thinking you're wasting your time i
should be walking while i'm sleeping
just to burn off those calories
so let's talk about calories for a
second
yes
exercise does burn calories
that's true
but not necessarily fat calories let's
take a look at something when a normal
person exercises
they actually stress their body out
okay sounds
pretty interesting but what all the
benefit from that exercise occurs in the
recovery 14 hours just 24 hours later
when you're in the deep sleep if you're
sleeping if you let yourself recover you
ever hear that workout called the p90x
or the insanity workout
i normally see people like 45 they start
doing that you ever see the videos they
have like 18 year olds
if you have low recovery like low
endurance low fitness
and you do that something that hot
you're going to hurt yourself you're
going to pull a hamstring i see it all
the time
my son i took him to wrestling practice
and he's like
16 17. i was wrestling in college we go
there and all the fathers are
around the mat they're standing around
the perimeter with their shoes off with
their socks on waiting to jump in there
because they're in their mind they're
still 18.
one guy breaks the rib
this guy you know he runs out of almost
like had a heart attack
it was hilarious so
mentally you might still be 18
physically you may not be quite that
level
so
it really all the benefit occurs in the
recovery after the workout so when you
exercise you stress your body and then
you're supposed to recover
and that's when you burn the fat not
during the workout if you don't believe
me go work out three hours
and weigh yourself before and after
you'll burn 900 calories but no actual
weight loss
okay so it's all right here
if you can recover
adrenal cases don't recover that well
so they don't adapt so the exercise only
as good as if you can
change or adapt to it so that's really
what we're dealing with is how do you
get your body to change from the things
you're doing it
how many found when you're 18 you can
pretty much eat anything you want
and really you can just get away with it
right how many find you can't quite get
away with it now
what is the difference the difference is
your metabolism the rate your metabolism
okay that's really what's broken
you really have to exercise based on
your ability to recover from it it's
better off for adrenals if you go
walking on a flat surface than to get on
that treadmill to burn off the calories
so the thing that people do
cut calories starvation exhaustive
exercise is the exact thing that's
keeping that weight there and they're
frustrated because
they've been taught that oh everyone
knows that you just have to exercise in
diet
oh really
well those people are saying that i've
never probably worked with one person i
bet
i've been there in the field of weight
loss for 25 years i worked on 35 000
different people
i believe a patient because i observe
them
they're eating good and it's still not
working they're doing the treadmill it's
still not working so it really has to do
with the internal so we want to adjust
the workout to
your ability to adapt that's why you
have to you can't put everyone in the
same program
everyone needs their their own program
so with adrenaline they can't get to
sleep because they're so wound up and
they can't relax because they're
thinking so much
or they get up in the middle of the
night like two
and just like they're more awake at two
than they are
during the day in fact right after lunch
or three o'clock they're just ready to
go to sleep
so
either they can't get to sleep you can't
stay sleep
or the bladder
which actually is controlled by the
adrenal
has to eliminate you know so they're
getting up urinating several times a
night that's adrenal
the best sleep for the adrenal is a half
hour before the alarm clock goes off
right there right when you finally get
to sleep
that's when you got to get out
can anyone relate to that yeah
don't worry it gets worse
um
so we got the adrenal will affect the
sleep create an inability to see change
from a workout
and
it also will affect your cognitive
it affects a lot of other things as well
it affects blood pressure
yeah that's one of the symptoms from the
adrenal is high blood pressure
especially of the top number the
systolic before the diastolic so always
look at the top number if the top number
is high we know it's adrenal so because
your body's you lost that recovery
mechanism to kind of keep the pressure
down so you have blood pressure we have
blood sugar yes diabetes is a symptom of
adrenal
because they control the sugars
blood cholesterol
is adrenal
yeah cholesterol is needed to make
adrenal hormones during stress the more
stress you go through the more
cholesterol you need to be able to build
those hormones
and then you have all allergies are
adrenal including the sinus
low vitamin d levels
are are adrenal you you know your doctor
saying go take vitamin d you're
deficient but they're not asking why
okay
arthritis all the itis in fact anything
connected with inflammation
is adrenal
poor handwriting
and that's me
um
i could write the first part of the the
word but the last just kind of gets all
lost so what this means blood pressure
blood sugar blood cholesterol allergies
vitamin d inflammation
and
cognitive
issues
insomnia
other than that you're perfectly healthy
now here is the problem
what happens is that
the medical system treats
treats these they don't ask
why there's no evaluation
what they'll do is take that symptom
okay
these are symptoms
this is what symptom is and then they
make it the problem
okay they confuse the symptom with the
problem it's like one of those obvious
things i'm like is it just me why is
anyone asking this question because if
you ask your doctor what caused this
what they'll do is convert it to a very
scientific complex name okay
you have lumbalgia what does that mean
low back pain
oh okay you have fibromyalgia what does
that mean you got you're hurting all
over your body
uh you have plantar fasciitis what does
that mean you got pain in the foot
you have dystatokinesis sounds pretty
scientific that means you can't do this
with your body you can't rotate it back
and forth
you have spondylothesis what does that
mean you have a you have a broken back
there's all these labels
post traumatic stress syndrome you means
you you've got some stress in your past
they have one now called
non-compliance to treatment disorder
i'm serious i'm not kidding
non-compliance to treatment disorder
if you don't do what the doctor says
i told my son that and he said oh homie
don't play that i'm like
i said i said what does homie don't play
that mean he said that means um
i'm not going to do what you say i'm
like oh okay
then you're going to get a diagnosis
from the doctor
because he's going to go you have
non-compliance treatment disorder well
maybe you didn't want the surgery maybe
you want a second opinion and they'll
put this label
they have a manic depressive what does
that mean it means that you're happy and
sad
what's wrong with being happy you know
you have a clinical depression it could
mean that you're not sleeping
people that don't sleep get depressed
so it's just amazing and then it's
treated
with a poison i'm sorry a medication
my whole thought is that
what's really missing in healthcare is
the health part
it's kind of like that
i mean i don't know sometimes i'm like
did i just think of that is that
original idea or does everyone know that
i mean it's bizarre there's no health
and health care it's all disease care
there are underlying principles
to all
subjects
in life that are very high
principles that everything kind of must
revolve around
okay my whole principle in weight loss
is getting healthy lose weight not
losing weight to get healthy you have to
focus on your health
now that's pretty powerful because
if you don't know that you're very
susceptible to the next unhealthy diet
that comes along or a little gimmick
that might not be healthy but if you
look at it from the viewpoint of okay is
that healthy yes okay that might work
let's just take the word food
how many of you eat food
okay
yeah how many of you never looked up the
definition of the word food before
okay i'm going to tell you what it is is
that which is eating sustained life
provide energy and promote the growth
and repair of tissue it comes from the
latin word which means nourishment
nutrients so food is nutrients that's
why we supposed to eat it
we're not supposed to eat food for
necessarily anything other than health
and nutrients but so when you go into
the grocery store
you can ask now
what am i in the mood for no no don't
ask that because you're going to get a
brownie
but if you say what can get me more
nutrition what's what can i eat that has
more nutrition that's very powerful
because then you get to stay out of
trouble
i guarantee all the junk foods don't
have a lot of nutrition they don't other
than synthetic vitamins
in politics you have underlying
principles that you use like the i guess
the principle in politics or the
underlying
senior principle would be something like
don't spend more than you have
right in the budget would that be kind
of a smart thing get out of trouble
so i guess we have to worry about that
one
just being sarcastic um and then you
have um what about in um
in the area of health in general you
have to or health care you have to
create your health
can you imagine
if we just put
one percent of the of the money we put
in sick care or health care into just
prevention or creating health
it's over
it's over i mean prevention the problem
is the doctors will say okay let's check
in six months okay and you keep coming
back let's check you let's check you
sorry to tell this you have cancer get
your stuff together
and it's we're going to do chemo
what was to be done to prevent it what
was done to create the health there's
nothing what are they going to do an
aspirin a day
i had to get life insurance okay
at least i'm still trying to figure out
why my wife wanted to get life insurance
so i go to the doctor my cholesterol is
uh
180 it's pretty good
doctor says well
it's normal but we're going to prevent
we're going to we're going to practice
some preventative medication like what
what do you talk about ceremony because
i know what we're just doing on everyone
right now
i'm like no thank you
no it's because no no i have a free
sample
lipitor i'm like no that is side effects
because oh no that's you can't believe
the articles you can't believe i'm like
you're gonna kick back
so the point is that there's a lot of
corruption in the area of
pharmaceuticals and drugs you already
know that but the point is that you have
to start creating your health because
the doctors just don't know how
i train doctors i train over 2 400
doctors they're not taught how to get
someone healthy
other than the food pyramid
drink more water eat more fiber
you know it's just like it's not
significant
so you really have to learn how to
create health yourself and start
building your health because no one else
is going to do it for you cancer takes
20 years to grow in your body i mean all
of you probably have some cancer cells
in your body it's what you're doing in
your environment that's countering that
right now to protect you
you literally you have to create your
health every day so i look at people a
little differently like what i'll do
when i'm listening to people i'll just
dissect them in half and i'll go okay
what are the things they're doing to
create their health and what are the
things they're doing to counter create
their health because doing nothing is
counter-creating right
so and it's amazing it makes it so
simple
i'm like wow
like wow look at this
like you don't have
you don't realize that
many people don't realize
that the cravings are a very simple
nutrient deficiency potassium when you
have low potassium
you will crave sugar
guaranteed when you get your daily
amount of potassium you will not crave
sugar it's that simple how many have
craved sugar
okay
if i tell you what to do would you would
you do it to get rid of cravings within
24 hours or actually 48 hours okay so do
this thing right here
normal amount of potassium we need is 4
700 milligrams a day
now what food are is high in potassium
bananas right that's 400
okay how many bananas would it take
12
12 bananas right
so
you're not going to do 12 bananas okay
so
the amount of potassium you need is so
high you don't even realize it there's a
lot of potassium so what you can do
is you can have all the leafy greens you
would need seven cups
to seven cups it's not hard couple
salads a day
and you will fulfill your daily amount
requirement for potassium you won't you
will not have cravings it's wonderful to
help protect against diabetes this right
here because when you have that
potassium it helps stabilize your blood
sugars but how many of you really don't
consume seven cups of salad a day
hardly anyone does
how the heck are you ever going to get
your potassium
so um this is the problem is we don't
really know what foods have the right
nutrients and and the soils are so
depleted if you would if you wanted to
get your basic nutrients of trace
minerals okay those are little minerals
that you need in small amounts in your
food right now with the soils the way
they are you would have to consume 27
000
calories of food
yeah
so that's going to be pretty hard isn't
it that's a lot of food eating every day
so you're going to have to subs or
enhance your diet with something just
make sure it's the right nutrients
plant-based you have to concentrate but
yeah that's this is the problem is that
people don't know how to create health
and so
it's kind of crazy
so so we have the adrenal we have uh
with the problem with the adrenal is you
get fluid retention because all the
electrolytes are controlled the sodium
potassium is controlled by the adrenal
in other words when you have adrenal
problems you lose potassium
your salts and electro all these things
that keep the fluid moving
are gone so the fluid is going to pull
in your ankles
when you press your ankle and leaves a
little dent that's fluid retention you
shouldn't have that
okay go ahead and press your ankle and
see if you have any
indentations there
can you call 9-1-1
so fluid in the ankles is purely an
electrolyte problem because the adrenal
it's backing up fluid so we have that
we're going to have salt cravings for
adrenal too
salt cravings that's adrenal salt is the
is the mineral that recharges the
battery that's why you need a little
chip at night when you go home i mean
just to recharge your battery because
you're drained
most of you are like a car in the
freeway the battery is dead and you're
putting gas in the car
why doesn't this thing start now you're
pushing the car it's getting kind of
heavy
so electrolytes
fluid now how much water should you
drink
eight classes right who told you that
they told you
someday
i'm going to find out who they is
because that is a myth
i was taught that you drink i still
can't find the uh where do you find this
information
only drink when you're thirsty here's
what i found the more water you drink
the more dehydrated you become why
because it flushes out the electrolytes
that are supposed to hold the water
there
there's a condition right now that i
think it's called um hyponutremia
which is actually too much water which
is flushing electrolytes and you can die
die by drinking too much water
so
drink when you're thirsty i have a
machine i measure fluid in a person's
body normally people that drink the most
water the most dehydrated
don't worry it gets worse
so
they
is everywhere it's nowhere it's like i
don't know who they is so you have
fluids we have calcium calcium is
controlled by the adrenal
not just bone loss not just muscle
cramps
but you need calcium to have to wind
down at night
without good adrenals your calcium will
deposit not in the bone but on the bone
as arthritis bursitis tendinitis tartar
in your teeth cataracts kidney stones
gallstones bursitis all the itis and
twitching in the left eyelid right here
yeah that's calcium
so again what do people take calcium
carbonate limestone it's in the one a
days
any time you get a vitamin that's
prescribed prescription at a pharmacy oh
my goodness that's like
how low can you go it's just way off the
deep end
it's just going to be rocks
you need plant-based minerals
this is how it works the plant is
supposed to break down the minerals like
rocks in the earth and absorb them into
the plant and make them easy to digest
the plant-based minerals
are 10 000 times smaller
than rocks and metallic minerals that
you get like sea salts
ten thousand times smaller so that would
be the equivalent to a
um a golf ball to the empire state
building
so you absorb these plant-based minerals
so much better you ever find that when
you eat food you don't feel satisfied
like it just doesn't quite
even water just doesn't satisfy you
because the nutrients aren't there why
do you think you keep craving
so it's just it's a deficiency
so we have sinus problems oh that's
another diagnosis sleep apnea what does
that mean it means that your sinuses are
blocked it's like very i mean it's just
amazing how it's gotten out of control
and so right now
the answer to healthcare is not spending
more money on it it's just to do more
prevention the whole philosophy is
broken but there's no money in
prevention
it's too cheap
i mean
it's very cheap
in fact i can take every one of your
grocery bills and probably find
a hundred dollars every two weeks of a
food that you could just switch over to
healthier food and just and just take
that and create health it's not that
hard it's just choices what to eat in
the grocery store why do i know this
because i go in the grocery store and i
see what they have it's so bad it's
amazing like wow people must be buying
that because it's there
i mean trying to find food in the
grocery store it's not easy
it's like um so we have adrenal any
other question about the adrenal body
type
it's kind of an interesting
type
snoring because the sinuses there's a
nerve that goes in the back of the
sinuses that if the adrenal gland
shrinks it because the cortisol and it
actually makes us thicker so you're like
you know snoring
so we have adrenal now um
the other thing is that of course my
wife says that sometimes i make that
sound i'm like no i don't
she goes okay i'm gonna record you i'm
like okay you can prove it so that's
adrenal
now the next body type is the ov
ovary body type
this is it right here
see this body type
look where they gain the weight lower
part in the hips thighs
that's estrogen dominance take a while
to guess why you don't see very many men
that look like that
they don't have ovaries very good
so the ovary will out produce too much
estrogen the estrogen makes fat around
the superficial from here down it will
also make your arms get big and the
breasts get big i had one patient she
was so estrogen dominant she became a
size h
i didn't even know it goes that high
i thought d double triple d was the
highest
let's see a b c d e f g h
yeah that's estrogen dominance how do
you know if you're estrogen dominant
if you look like that and also you have
heavy periods
cramping pms all that guess what that's
going to do it's going to make a fibroid
i see so many women with fibroids it's
estrogen dominance so what's the
solution
cut it out i mean they're not doing
anything there are foods that you can
eat right now that will balance estrogen
it's called the cruciferous vegetable
cruciferous vegetables are like kale
broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage all
the foods that no one eats those are
very estrogen
they clean up the estrogen they balance
it and the chemicals thank goodness we
have those foods in our diet
um if we ever eat them but mainly people
cook the heck out of them don't they
yeah
so um estrogen dominant will cause
anything wrong with this cycle
heavy periods
headaches that time of the month
uh cravings that time of the month
um pms
how many of you know people that are pms
okay
i can see the husbands are not like
they're like
so you have all these different issues
that happen that time of the month if
it's cyclic because the hormones go on
waves just like all these circadian
waves
um fertility infertility
because estrogen you know what's really
amazing
things
you have this estrogen dominant patient
and guess what they give them birth
control pills
it's the exact opposite thing you're
going to put it more in estrogen
dominance
what foods should they stay away from
soy why
because soy is very estrogenic
and the soy that's in america is not the
same that's another place it's not
fermented it's like it's just soy powder
it's soy protein isolates what does that
do
it's going to grow tumors in your liver
and your um in your um
where else in the ovaries in the uterus
it'll grow tumors it's very tumor
producing
yeah i see it all the time
there were even some men that came in
they were drinking so much soy milk they
started lactating that was enough for me
to cut it completely out of the diet but
there's estrogen is very very um
bad for the liver
and
um
it's every it's in almost a lot it's in
a lot of foods isn't it it's genetically
modified it's almost 100 genetically
modified in the us and that means they
alter the structure so there's a lot of
unknowns right now there's no studies
so um you know it doesn't have to be on
the label too to be genetically modified
they could just stick it in there so you
have soy it's in also in a lot of
prepackaged foods a lot of diets
yeah isn't that interesting the stuff
that causes estrogen is in these eyes
why do they use it because it's so cheap
it's so cheap
i made a kale shake with um i was going
to put some protein and the guy that was
helping me develop the formula says oh
you got to put some soy and it's really
cheap i'm like
i'm not going to put that in there
that's going to like kill people so i
put um
spirulina
that's like a veg vegeta a vegetable um
a sea vegetable so it has some egg white
organic egg white and kale but the point
is that you don't want to do a lot of
estrogen
with that because then you want to make
sure if they're doing meats and dairy
they have organic
hormone free
this body type
craves
dairy they like ice cream cheese yogurt
it's wow they're trying to get some
hormones in there to try to balance
something because they're out of balance
it won't ever work though
so they have a lot of issues with that
and then when they get to be age 52
the ovaries
stop
working okay
but guess what
you have a backup organ here's the
ovaries the adrenals are little
triangles on top of the kidney
these start doing the work so now if the
adrenal glands are weak going in the
menopause you're going to overload those
things and now this is going to do all
the work
and so now you're going to have all
sorts of problems with hot flash flashes
night sweats okay does anyone have a hot
flash
okay
so hot flashes
are basically
a short circuit in the electrical system
of your body
that's just kind of like
it's blowing that heat right there
someone's having a hot flash right now
um
so that would be hot flashes
so
this body type ends up looking like this
body type after menopause
so what am i trying to tell you i'm
trying to give you a clue that you
better do something now
before it's too late
now some of you in your mind you're
thinking wow i'm a mixed body type i'm
everything right
you always have a primary
too much estrogen
will block the thyroid
that's why when you get pregnant you
might end up with a thyroid problem
because the excess estrogen will block
this and then create all sorts of
problems
many many borderline thyroid cases need
to take thyroid medication when they're
pregnant because of the spike of
estrogen so all these things work
together
if
the liver is bad which we're going to
get to next
your thyroid can't work the ear thyroid
needs
that liver to convert like 80 of all the
activation of that hormone curse with
your liver
so i had a lady
she came in she did the wrong diet for
her body type she did the high protein
diet okay
she was a liver type liver types should
not do high protein diets okay
what happened she lost weight but she
also lost all of her hair
well she had two gray hairs
uh she had a wig a very nice wig
um and she came in and she said doctor
gotta help me i'm like okay what's going
on she goes look at
i was like okay yes we need to we need
to work on that so i said um
what happened to you she goes i just did
this diet i lost all my hair
i said bingo you mess with your liver
and then the block the thyroid
now here's the problem
she was gonna she was she was gonna get
married okay
her husband future husband had no clue
she was completely bald
okay that's the situation wouldn't you
it's like it's it's like the honeymoon
night um
honey now that we're married um
surprise
and then he pulls off his toupee
i think there was like a movie where you
can pull off your arm and your leg
[Music]
so i worked on her
i do a technique which which works on
old stress it's an acupressure not
puncture and we worked on her and worked
on the liver and
she got her hair back in three weeks
tiny little hair she came back she was
real happy
got married never told them went great
yeah
so these hormones have dominating things
dominating
power to do certain things
we when you actually
age
when you go from 20s 30s 40s 50s okay
hormones change
metabolism slows down would you agree
with that
you can't keep doing the same thing with
the calorie counting you have to look at
the hormones in relationship to the
triggering of the fat burning hormones
i'm going to show you something before i
get to the next body type real fast
hormones there are three
dominating
hormones
that if present in small amounts
will completely block and cancel all the
fat
burning hormones okay
in other words
you have two things you have things that
you should avoid
and you have things that you should do
the things that you should avoid are
much much much much more important
than the things that you should do
it's the little stuff okay so let's take
this one the first one is called insulin
insulin is a hormone that regulates
sugar it decreases sugar it's triggered
by sugar so every time you eat sugar it
spikes the insulin okay then you become
a diabetic and then sugar goes high it
doesn't go down so you have to take
insulin
in the presence of just a little tiny
bit of insulin
it can cancel out and completely destroy
all the good stuff that you did so let's
just make this real let's take a cookie
80 calories
you can walk that off in about a mile
but the sugar in that one cookie
will will block that burning for 72
hours
if you have a slow metabolism
like most people do
a half a glass of orange juice
a glass of wine unless dr oz told you to
do it
which i'm just being sarcastic because
i'm like wine is alcohol it's sugar it's
like it's going to completely block you
so we got insulin right it's the little
stuff that's going to really mess you up
so we have to we have to give you
substitutes for the thing you crave i
already know
a habit is almost impossible to break
so we don't want to take all the
pleasure away from you in life
we want to tweak it so there's things
you can eat
brownies for example that have no sugar
no flour and you can eat those you just
have to know how to make them when we
have the recipes we give you and you can
actually have it in the refrigerator and
go for that
every night or when you when you like
that
number two
cortisol
too much cortisol that's the stress
you're not going to lose weight and that
how do you get rid of stress sleeping
walking
i teach people to do an acupressure
technique which basically pulls the
stress out you do it before bed and you
just get into a good sleep and it
extracts the old stress so cortisol will
block fat burning that's why you have
like when you have physical trauma and
then you have losses loss of a loved one
or a divorce whatever that will hit the
adrenal a thousand times harder than a
physical trauma
that's why you have people that like
after like this major event they're just
like they never recover that's why you
get autoimmune diseases like lupus and
ms they all come after losses
okay
so then we have the last hormone that
makes you fat is called estrogen
remember all those hidden sources of
estrogen it's in the hormones in europe
people are thinner than americans
in america we got girls going through
the menstrual cycle a lot earlier larger
breasts
kids are fatter you might say it's a lot
of different things but i think the
hormones are really messing us up
if you
now you guys realize that turkeys are
fed hormones that's why they're bigger
they're huge right they can grow them
fast if you consume the turkey that's
been injected with a hormone
is it possible that some of that residue
can get in your body
if it makes a turkey a butterball turkey
is it possible to make a butterball out
of you
butterball turkey
welcome to america
you're in the wrong country at the wrong
time
so some of these poor countries they're
really rich in nutrients
but they come here and they just get
that i see it all the time they moved to
america i'm like you're doing fine so
you moved here
welcome to virginia
so we have to eat
and understand
how to fortify our hormones okay that's
really important so last body type is
called the liver body type
the liver is located
right here the size of a football it's
three and a half pounds put your hand on
your liver it's on the right side
the military right over here okay good
your liver
is kind of an extra organ you don't
really need it i'm just being sarcastic
the liver
if if it becomes dysfunctional you're
going to start getting more of a
protruded
pot belly okay you ever see the guy in
the beach with a speedo sorry to give
that image but that's kind of like a
basketball belly it's hard it's higher
if you take your hand on one side and
tap it it'll create a little ripple why
because
most of it's fluid it's called ascites
it's a fluid it means fluid it's leak
the liver is leaking fluid into that sac
right there
so
how many sit-ups won't work sit-ups
won't work their legs are skinny it's
just right there
it's not just beer it's actually fluid
coming from destruction of the liver the
two foods that destroy the liver are
heavy cooked
proteins
animal proteins
heavy cooked texas style steaks this
thick big ones every night before you go
to bed
deep fried food deep fried catfish will
do it too
just all that fat and meat will just
destroy the liver so the worse the liver
the more you can't tolerate the heavy
proteins the older you get the less you
can tolerate red meat
so what happens is that you want to
adjust the food based on your weakness
but the good thing about the liver it's
the only organ that can completely
regenerate a hundred percent
but the bad news is it takes three years
of eating a certain way
okay
the liver is the hub of so many things
the liver will cause a liver problem
will cause pain on the right side right
shoulder why is it on the right shoulder
the liver is on the right it's going to
be swell up it's going to go right here
if you have a liver problem don't sleep
on your left side because it's too heavy
it's going to compress the heart you're
going to feel uncomfortable you'll sleep
on the right side
the liver will create little red spots
on your skin little red dot skin
psoriasis eczema little liver spots
itchy skin
hot feet white tongue that's a yeast
chronic halitosis that's bad breath
sometimes they usually talk to you very
close in front of your face
they don't know that they have bad
breath
it's like really
um they have a lot of digestive bloating
okay
now the liver
makes bile
now there's a confusion about bile some
people think it's bowel no no that's
bowel bile b-i-l-e
bile
helps it's like the detergent that
breaks down the grease
it helps you digest the fats
and it helps you absorb
the fat vitamins that cyber vitamins
vitamin a if you're deficient about mna
you're going to have a hard time seeing
at night
you're going to have sinus problems
you're going to have dry skin
you're going to have a little uh yellow
thing in your inside of your eye right
here a little tag there there's a lot of
issues with vitamin a vitamin d you're
gonna have problems with calcium
you're gonna have problems with seasonal
depression
vitamin e you're gonna have problems
with libido vitamin um let's see a e
d and k you're gonna have bruising
so you have a lot of other issues just
for me doing a bio how do you know if
you don't have bile you're gonna bloat
when you eat
you're gonna get bloating
burping
belching
headache on the right side 98 percent of
headaches and migraines are coming from
that right there
try and experiment next time you get a
headache
press right here on your gallbladder
just press right there and just hold
that for two minutes
your headache will go right away the
problem is not in your head
it's in your down here because when you
step on a dog's tail he barks through
his mouth right
okay i'm just checking
so we get bloating burping belching many
people don't have the bile and they're
bloat when they like at night they feel
like they're pregnant yet during the day
they have flat stomach
is that real to anyone
okay
so the liver
they they crave deep fried
catfish they like deep-fried anything
because they're not absorbing it so
you're gonna want the stuff that you
can't absorb
the other symptom is that when you eat
you're gonna need a little sweet after
you eat
you need that little sweet because
you're not digesting fats to satisfy
your blood sugars okay you're going to
be grouchy in the morning because you
have a low blood sugar in the morning
how many work with people that are
grouchy in the morning
okay so what you do on monday when you
go back to work just go up to uh go up
to the guy
hey john listen you know i've been
holding a grudge on you because you've
been very kind of grouchy but now i know
it's just your liver i forgive you
[Laughter]
or the next time you go the all you eat
buffet
just go online
excuse me sir
have you ever had your liver checked
do you have any right shoulder pain
do you ever itch in the bottom of your
feet
let me see your tongue for a second
here's dr berg's card you might want to
give him a call do you get bloating by
the way
actually don't mention my name if you
say that
um
they might get offended see the problem
with teaching you this seminar is you're
going to want to evaluate everyone you
know everywhere you go you're going to
spot oh liver third two two two
sorry
so that is liver
um
liver is uh
they do very well on cruciferous
vegetables
okay any other questions about the body
types
yes
i notice you have the
man the male there with the
liver
and i know a male cannot have a very
ovary what about the other
what would it look like to see a male
um it's very rare so she asked question
why what would it look like if there's a
male with these other ones it's did it's
very rare to have a primary thyroid body
type
it's usually secondary
to
having the thyroid removed
because of estrogen dominance
too much estrogen is underneath most of
the thyroids i mean it's just it's
almost not
existent
this is very common this this adrenal
right here just because of stress that's
probably the number one thing
you see this because of just bad eating
from years
but the ovary is very common too so this
one here these three are very common so
if
if that guy was a
thyroid
they would just be big all over if that
guy was adrenal he would have more of a
sagging belly it wouldn't be so high in
the top
okay
and of course he wouldn't have that
typically
let's see he had a lot of soy milk
now this next thing i'm going to tell
you is so important it's the most
important thing that i have to talk
about so if anyone's checked out check
back in right now do you hear
you've heard that obesity is a health
risk right it causes diabetes heart
attack stroke
cancer
bad luck right everything right
that's what i was taught too
but i found that's absolutely not true
it's a myth
let me explain i had a patient come in
29 years old weighed 325 pounds
did my program this is a long time ago
take a while guess how much weight she
lost in the first month
nope
no exactly it's zero pounds she lost
zero pounds okay now who would be
depressed if you lost zero weight
yeah
but she was actually okay with it
because she felt better okay the second
month she lost 21 pounds
the third month she lost 63
pounds it was at that point when i had a
light bulb go off i'm like wow you don't
you don't lose weight and get healthy
you get healthy to lose weight see i've
been doing it the other way around that
changed my whole practice because now
everything that i aligned was going to
get them healthy and i started to see
results on people that wouldn't normally
ever get results
it's the health you cannot be fat and
healthy at the same time
being healthy the weight comes off as a
natural side effect
obesity is a symptom of an unhealthy
body not the cause of it why are they
doing that why are they pushing it so
they can come up with the drugs to treat
it again it's a symptom
does this make sense
so
here's what i want you to do
i want you to change
your viewpoint
goal
from losing weight to creating more
health go ahead and do it right now
go ahead and just shift make the shift
come on in the back there
shift it okay good so have you decided
that you'll create more health
because that's how you do it
forget about the diets we have to get
your lifestyle corrected
forget about vitamins unless you can get
your eating corrected
because
understanding that is a superior
principle that will take you not just to
lose weight but to get younger as you
get older i'm 65 no i'm just kidding
no i'm 47
but i feel like i'm 25
i mean i wrestle my kids
and i um and i'm like i'm working out
i'm actually trying to reverse the aging
process
and so that's what i want you guys to do
every year you get older you're getting
younger but all it takes is a shift of
viewpoint
rather than oh here's the diet you have
to understand what to do so there's
three things i want you to do number one
find out your body type
number two
get in a plan that's specific for your
body type
and number
three to it through creating healthy
habits that you can do long term
so it's all about create your health
every day it has to be built just like
everything else in life
i want to thank you guys for coming i
hope you learned something i appreciate
your attention this long
have a great afternoon
[Applause]

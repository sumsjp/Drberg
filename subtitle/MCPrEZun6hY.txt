let's talk about vertigo okay what to do if you have vertigo vertigo is a type of dizziness that
occurs seconds after you have certain head movements you can feel like you're spinning
you can feel like you're not balanced in fact it could be pretty devastating
i want to share with you some interesting clues that can help us
figure out what to do for this condition now one cause is having some type of mucus in your
in your sinuses but the other thing i want to talk about is calcium deposits in the inner
ear now there's various clues that indicate that there could be calcium deposits causing this
problem number one a very popular medication they use for vertigo called flunarizine is a calcium
antagonist which means it blocks calcium alright so that's clue number one it could be too much
calcium another clue is a new study that i'll put down below so you can check it out relating to
vitamin d and they only used 400 eye use and there was some really good results reducing the symptoms
of vertigo now i would recommend at least 10 000 international units maybe even more
at first if you're trying to remove calcium from the body all right next clue is this
in the inner ear you have receptors for vitamin d okay they're called vitamin d receptors and you
have quite a few and so vitamin d has everything to do with calcium metabolism and regulation as
well as the immune system okay in your inner ear all right and last clue and i'm going to put these
links down below there are quite a few reports of people having improvement by taking vitamin k2 for
vertigo now what is vitamin k2 it's a vitamin that is different from vitamin k1 it helps you remove
calcium from the wrong places in your body and so if there's calcium in the arteries or calcium in
the joints or calcium in the eyes or calcium in the kidney vitamin k2 can help take that calcium
and put it into the bone and so if there's calcium in the inner ear you'd want to take vitamin k2
i would recommend taking vitamin d3 10 000 ius each day with a meal and at the same time take
vitamin k2 i would recommend a mk7 version 100 micrograms and that way you have the right ratio
of vitamin k2 and vitamin d3 to hopefully help reduce the calcium buildup in the inner ear
and hopefully improve your vertigo symptoms hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

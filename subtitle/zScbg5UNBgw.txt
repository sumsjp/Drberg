postmenopausal women need more butter and more egg yolks why because they're at risk for getting
osteoporosis or osteopenia because of the shift in hormones their estrogen and progesterone just
took a tank downward and now they're in a situation where they have to build bone
now the mistake that a lot of women make is they go right for the calcium they start taking
calcium supplements like calcium carbonate big mistake because that increases the risk
of heart attacks the vitamin that they really need more of is vitamin k2 this is not k1 it's k2
and guess where you get k2 grass-fed butter egg yolks and several other foods let's just
go through the list grass-fed butter and you can probably put this on your keto bread recipe organ
meats cheeses egg yolks dark chicken meat fish eggs as in caviar natto this is a fermented soybean
some people cannot stand it but it's something that they consume in Japan
breast milk i just added this in here just so you know that vitamin k2 is in breast milk not
that you're going to you know get your k2 from this lard by the way tallow this is
pig fat and this is beef fat is both of these are really good to cook with because they have vitamin
k2 and they also have vitamin d versus other oils like vegetable oils which is very very bad
but vitamin k2 binds calcium with protein and in your bones you have a lot of protein
you have a lot of calcium so you need k2 to do the job also vitamin k2 controls calcium
into the bone it makes the bone very very solid and strong vitamin k2 decreases calcification
in your arteries it helps a person's blood sugars it decreases the risk of kidney stones cancer and
also the risk of getting dementia western price was a dentist wrote a book and this is way back
years ago before vitamin k2 was ever even recognized or discovered and he called vitamin k2
activator x that's what he named it because there was there was no name for vitamin k2 and he found
that it was a missing nutrient for a lot of things especially related to bone teeth dental formation
and a lot of other things so if you're post-menopausal don't do the calcium
supplement instead you know some cheese would be better to get your calcium consume some
of these foods and definitely definitely do not go on a low fat diet thanks for watching

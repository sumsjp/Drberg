you
okay I want you to notice that I dressed
up for you today because we're having a
fancy dip we're making a lot of dips for
the holidays
it's dip week it's dip week at the
Burke's and I wore my very special pearl
apron because this is an amazing spinach
artichoke dip this is hands-down one of
the favorites of any party you're going
to go to and if you serve it it'll be
gone in a heartbeat
actually it's two steps at the stove but
it's really pretty simple to to make if
you just throw everything in and then
pop it in the oven now you want to serve
it with vegetables of course not breads
oh yeah Parmesan cheese that's what I'm
talking about
spinach mm-hmm it's fancy but it's
simple yeah so you should learn how to
make it

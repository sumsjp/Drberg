let's talk about the diet for peripheral neuropathy now what is peripheral neuropathy it
is a condition where you're experiencing tingling numbness or burning type pain in the bottom
of your feet or your fingertips and the most common way you would get peripheral neuropathy
is by having diabetes and so peripheral neuropathy first starts in the longer nerves of the body okay
and it happens at the very end of that nerve and what's happening is you're getting a destruction
of the tiny blood vessels to the nerves and the destruction is not necessarily coming from
the high sugar directly or high blood glucose directly the high blood glucose is creating
a lot of inflammation free radical damage and destruction to the proteins on the inside of your
artery so it's going to clog this thing up it's going to starve the blood supply to the nerve now
why is that blood supply there to feed the nerve oxygen and nutrients and so peripheral neuropathy
is basically killing off the nerves so we're getting microvascular damage also it's happening
in the eye too if you're a diabetic but what i want to tell you especially if you're new to my
channel and you have peripheral neuropathy it is actually very very easy to undo this condition and
get relief if you simply see this high sugar right here start consuming low carbs that's
called a healthy ketogenic diet start doing low carbs immediately i am blown away how many people
with peripheral neuropathy don't know this information they're doing a high carb diet and
they're on the medication and they're suffering so bad it's completely unnecessary this condition can
be reversed so you start doing low carbohydrate especially if you're consuming high carbohydrates
with protein like most people do or high carb with fat like an ice cream something like that
you're creating more damage than just carbs alone when you combine a carb with a protein you create
something called glycation which basically destroys certain proteins in the body that
now become permanent it's very difficult to undo that and it clogs up all sorts of things as in
circulation you also want to make sure that you have very low amounts of omega-6 oils in the diet
like for example the corn oil the soy oil that's in the salad dressing it's in so many foods
especially if you go out to eat very often because that's what they cook everything with it's also in
the soups it's in the breads and all that stuff and then you also want to combine intermittent
fasting both of those together will put you in really good shape and i put a link down below of
exactly how to do it but there's three additional things that can help you get relief immediately
you can get these from the health of store benfotiamine this is a fat soluble b1 i would take
four capsules a day spread them out what this does is it helps to lower the inflammation and
the damage that's created from the high sugar because the high sugar in your blood has created
a huge need for more b1 and so what the body will do is starts to deplete your
b1 reserves until the point where you have no more and then you can't actually make the myelin
sheath around the nerve which is the insulating fat layer so you can't make that without b1
so you start putting it back in there and things start to heal up alpha lipoic acid
is another very important one and even this on its own has been known to improve
peripheral neuropathies so you can take this as a supplement you can get it anywhere
and also tocatrinos this is a type of vitamin e that works 50 times stronger than tocopherols
it's a powerful antioxidant all three of these together plus the diet with intermittent fasting
would be a very powerful weapon against peripheral neuropathy before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

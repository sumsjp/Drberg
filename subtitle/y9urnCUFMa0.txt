someone had a question about should they consume more fiber for gallstones so i wanted to create
a quick video of the relationship between fiber and gallstones so the more fiber that you consume
what's going to happen is you're going to release more bile through the body
over 95 percent of all the body in your body gets reabsorbed
in the last part of your small intestine and what happens is as you lose more bile
there is certain sensors in your large intestine that signal back up to the liver telling the liver
we don't have enough bile and so this negative feedback loop causes the liver to make more bile
and the more bile that your body makes the less concentrated the cholesterol stones become and the
greater the decreased risk of gall stones because the actual cause of gallstones is a lack of bile
more production of bile will help decrease the risk of gallstones
and if you're not sure what bile does it does a lot of stuff number one it helps you absorb
fat soluble vitamins omega-3 fats it helps it's like a detergent that helps break down fats bile
also goes through your small intestine and helps you kill bacteria because normally you shouldn't
have a lot of bacteria in the small intestine and that way it prevents something called sibo
but then when the bile gets all the way down to the end of that small intestine
95 percent supposed to get reabsorbed and go to liver and start the cycle over and over again so
there's this really tight feedback loop going on and the last thing i want to say is the fiber that
i'm going to recommend that you always consume would be more vegetable fiber as compared to
grain fiber all right thanks for watching you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

on one of my recent videos someone wanted to know uh if it's okay to put toothpaste on their pimples
okay so i decided just to create a video on that because if there's more than one person thinking
that um they need to get this information first thing to know is that toothpaste is formulated
for your teeth not for your skin there are several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for
your skin first one is sodium bicarbonate that's baking soda the ph is nine it's very alkaline your
skin is acidic it's five so anytime you start to neutralize the acid on the on your surface
of your skin you're going to irritate it okay so baking soda is not good to put on the outside of
your body also it's going to disrupt your natural flora or your bacteria of your skin
next one sodium lauryl sulfate this compound actually can reduce plaque on your teeth
so when you put on your skin it's going to be too harsh it's going to remove the oil layer
it's going to irritate the skin it can actually even cause a rash that might look like acne
next one is triclosan certain studies show that it may make your bacteria resistant to
antibiotics but number four is probably the most important thing to know the fluoride
in your toothpaste could create a condition called fluoroderma which looks just like acne
there's a real interesting book that i read and i actually did a video on it
i'll put a link for the book and the video down below and so if you're rubbing fluoride on your
skin or consuming tap water with fluoride or taking a shower in water that has fluoride
it may worsen your skin this is why i recommend using a fluoride filter for your shower
so if you want nice skin don't use toothpaste on your acne instead
do these four things right here reduce your carbs get on a ketogenic diet why
because carbs increase insulin which then increases androgens and too many
antigens cause acne as in pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome also doing fasting intermittent fasting
is probably one of the most powerful things you can do for your skin next one probiotics because
if you don't have enough good bacteria in your gut it actually can affect the bacteria on the surface
of their skin and actually cause not only acne but all sorts of issues with the skin and last one is
to avoid dairy since dairy does have certain hormones like estrogen and that can throw off
your hormonal balance and produce acne as well if people are estrogen dominant they get cystic acne
all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

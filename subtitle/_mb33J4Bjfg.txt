we're going to talk about re-feeding symptoms after a fast now if you're just doing
you know intermittent fasting where you're doing you know two meals a day or one meal a day
this video is not for you this video is more about the person who does a 36 hour fast or 48 hour fast
or a 72 hour faster longer so what happens is the longer you fast the less you need of hydrochloric
acid bile enzymes i mean they're being produced but not in the same quantity so they tend to
uh adapt and shut down to some degree and you come in there like like i did after a long fast and you
eat this huge meal oh my goodness are you going to feel sick you may feel arthritis nauseous bloating
tired you may even get diarrhea gas or stomach pain so you don't want to do that very simply
you want to consume a small meal this usually is fine cooked or steamed veggies and not a lot
just a little bit or a small salad of leafy greens with a little olive oil and maybe some vinaigrette
maybe a little bit of berries okay or a little bit of fermented vegetables and maybe some
protein like one egg or a little bit of chicken maybe you have a chicken wing or a chicken leg
and a little bit of fish maybe three ounces but that's it not a big meal for your first meal so
now after you started this what's going to happen is you're going to start producing a little more
hydrochloric acid a little more bile a little more enzymes then the next meal after this could
be a little bit bigger and then a little bit bigger etc but the reason why vegetables seem
to be the best thing to consume is because they have enzymes already in them to help you digest
and so anytime you eat food without enzymes your body has to make them if you have enough but don't
start out with that first meal having a huge texas style steak of red meat okay don't do a large meal
don't do a high fat meal like i did and don't do a whole bunch of nut butters like peanut butter
as your first meal or else you're gonna not feel too well all right thanks for watching hey before

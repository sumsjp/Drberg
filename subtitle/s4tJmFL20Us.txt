You are about to learn the secret to
stopping porn addiction once and for
all. This could literally save years of
misery. Because chronic porn addiction
doesn't just destroy someone's sex life.
It destroys their ability to feel
emotion, joy, pleasure from anything.
Porn addiction isn't about sex. It's not
about pleasure. It's about dopamine.
Right now, pornography is the number one
cause of erectile dysfunction in men
under 40 years old. And erectile
dysfunction is not just about losing
erections. It's about losing libido.
It's about losing the ability to climax,
causing a person to feel very empty,
craving the stimulation, giving into it,
and then the whole cycle starts over and
over again. It's a trap. So pornography
not only destroys a person's private
parts and sensation for sex, but also
their relationships. The porn industry
is not selling sex. They're selling
dopamine spikes. The biggest confusion I
think people have with dopamine is they
think that it's a pleasure hormone. It's
not. It's actually a neurotransmitter,
which is similar to a hormone, but it
works within the nervous system.
Dopamine is all about the anticipation
before the pleasure. It's the want. It's
the craving. It's the gas pedal. It's an
excitatory neurotransmitter. It gets you
to seek out certain things for survival.
So, there's other things that will give
you the pleasure, but dopamine is not
that. Pornography is hijacking this
whole system right here, which is the
basis of bad habits and addictions.
There's something called the coolage
effect. They've researched male mammals
and after mating, the interest in that
mate drops. But if you take the mammal
and introduce it to a new female, that
desire instantly returns. So pornography
tends to weaponize this. This is why on
their sites they have endless sidebars
with all sorts of related videos and
autoplay. But also there's this
escalation from watching soft porn to
more hardcore porn to more extreme porn.
And the reason that is is because of
this. Anytime you get an extreme
dopamine spike, the receptors in the
cell get sucked right back into the cell
to the point where you get less
receptors and less receptors for
dopamine. And so the feedback loop
basically tells the body to make more
and more and more dopamine because it's
not connecting to the cell. This is a
very similar thing that happens with
insulin resistance as well. When you
consume a lot of carbohydrates over a
period of time and you increase this
hormone called insulin, the receptors
for insulin do the exact same thing.
They get sucked into the cell and that
whole mechanism causes the body to
compensate and make more and more of it.
So what happens over time is you get a
massive amount of dopamine which creates
a massive amount of anticipation craving
almost like an obsessive urge to watch
more porn or if it's with insulin
resistance you're addicted now to sugar.
But on the other side the actual
pleasure sensation goes lower and lower
and lower and lower. And this is why a
person can go from soft porn to extreme
porn because they need more and more of
that to create or feel a sensation or a
satisfaction. I mean just think about
our ancestors. They would go out and get
food maybe every 3 days. Nowadays we
have food around us 247 very easy
access. Unlimited carbohydrates,
unlimited junk food. And then think
about our ancestors with mates. Very
difficult to find mates. Now, you could
find three artificial mates, which of
course are all fake every three seconds
by scrolling on a pornography site. And
the porn industry knows this. They've
done research on this. They have a lot
of the big data. They know the soft porn
goes into the extreme porn. They know
how it affects dopamine and how to use
this to get people more addicted. But
the big problem is it's desensitizing
dopamine for you. Think about the porn
industry. 98 to 99% of all porn is free.
The porn industry makes billions of
dollars in profits from that 1 to 2%
that pay for the porn. The people that
are paying for the porn are completely
desensitized from dopamine. Now they
need extreme hardcore porn to create any
stimulation at all because their
dopamine receptors are literally gone.
Too much of it in the body creates
something called exytoxicity.
Too much excitement is toxic to your
neurons. It can actually kill the nerve
cells. Let me just give you another
example. So, let's say we're in a dark
room and we turn on a flashlight. Okay?
So, you can probably see my face right
here. If I take the flashlight and shine
it into your eyes or right into my eyes
right here, I'm going to squint, right?
because the light is too bright. It's
too much volume. So, the squinting to
the light is protecting my eyes from the
light. It's an adaptive mechanism. This
is what's happening with your cells with
dopamine. The receptors are squinting
and they're not allowing this dopamine
to enter the cell. That's called down
reggulation. So when you're in a
relationship with a real person, it's
slower. It's unpredictable versus porn,
which is instant, extreme, and so
unfortunately, the person is in a trap.
They're stuck in pictures on the
internet and also in their mind. And it
keeps your brain in a constant state of
massive dopamine spikes. And this is
where real life can't compete with this.
So now, let's get into the secret of how
we undo this problem. The good news is
that the downgraded receptors are
reversible. And so what's the secret to
reversing this?
Being bored. Because at first you're
thinking people go towards pornography
originally because they're bored. But
it's also a cure. I'm not talking about
passively being bored with life. Okay?
I'm talking about actively being bored
with the screaming dopamine that is
inside you telling you to go watch porn.
I know personally I hate being bored. I
will keep myself super busy all the time
to prevent boredom because sometimes
it's very very painful just sitting
around doing nothing. But I want you to
use boredom as a weapon. Okay, let me
explain. Think about porn as this
screaming person. You can give into the
screaming. You can yell back at the
screaming. Or better yet, you can go
into a state of boredom. And the more
obsessive this urge, the more you sit
back and just get bored on purpose,
aggressively being bored. Because just
like insulin resistance, right? You're
going to go on a fast. You're going to
stop eating carbohydrates. There has to
be something you're going to have to do
to avoid this dopamine spike. And
boredom is the best way to do a dopamine
fast. Why? Because what triggers
dopamine is excitement, anticipation.
What lowers dopamine is the lack of
that. When you get these urges or these
desires or these impulses to go watch
porn, don't fight it. Don't negotiate
it. Don't try to distract it. Don't try
to escape. Just sit there. Be there
comfortably. observe how loud it gets
and then turn up the boredom. That is
how the receptors come back. And what
you're going to observe is the impulse
will go up and then it goes down. And
you continue to be bored. Every time you
have this impulse, it's going to become
easier and easier to deal with this.
Why? Because you're going to have
normalized dopamine and less obsessive
thoughts about doing that. Now, parallel
with that, you want to make sure your
environment aligns with this, right?
Like, don't take your phone in the
bedroom where you're tempted. Put
blockers on all of your devices. Do not
use social media where there's any soft
porn at all. I mean, this is the exact
same thing you would do if you had sugar
cravings, right? You don't buy junk food
and you don't bring junk food in the
house. That way, it's not there to tempt
you. Make sure your environment doesn't
have any triggers. We're trying to get
rid of the constant stimulation that
occurs with dopamine. A couple other
things that are super vital to restore
dopamine.
Sleep. Get more sleep. If you can take
naps, that's good. But an extra hour of
sleep will be huge in restoring those
receptors for dopamine. Consistent
regular exercise restores the dopamine
issue as well. Especially resistance
training also going on a low
carbohydrate diet. Why? because
carbohydrates also create this dopamine
spike as well. So, you want to do the
healthy version of the ketogenic diet.
Take more zinc. Zinc is probably one of
the most important trace minerals in
dopamine with magnesium,
getting more sunlight, being outside,
keeping yourself busy, doing productive
things. So, remember, porn addiction is
not about sex. It's about hijacking this
system right here, dopamine. And the way
out is not through more stimulation.
It's primarily about applying this one
emotion, boredom, which is the best
emotion, not about your whole life, just
about being bored with the screaming
going on inside. I have a free download

since we're on the topic of dopamine,
insulin resistance or carb addiction is
another parallel problem. If you have

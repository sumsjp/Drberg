all right vitamin d very very important in feeding your microbes your microbes are dependent
on the vitamin d that you either get from the sun you take as a supplement or get from your
food which by the way is almost next to impossible to get unless you're consuming
a lot of fatty fish but other than that it's going to be really hard to get it from the food
and many people don't go out in the sun as much and so there's a lot of barriers in getting that
vitamin d and when you feed the microbiome they develop significantly in their diversity so you
can increase the diversity of your microbes with feeding them fiber from vegetables but you can
also increase the diversity from getting enough vitamin d which is actually quite fascinating
there are certain ratios of microbes that come out correct if you have enough vitamin d there
are additional microbes that will grow in the presence of vitamin d in fact these microbes
are major butyrate producers now what is butyrate butyrate is the small chain fatty acid that helps
improve your blood sugars it helps to feed the colon cells it actually gives you
energy when you produce this it actually supports insulin and keeping insulin more sensitive
and a lot of people have a problem with that as well these microbes that are dependent on
vitamin d also help you make vitamin b and so they actually exchange the b vitamins and they also
give us b vitamins and if they're not there because you are deficient in vitamin d then
you can be deficient in the b vitamins as well and that can affect sleep it can affect stress
and your skin and all sorts of things now the great majority of the population has a
subclinical deficiency of vitamin d which means that it may not even show up on your blood
it could be in the conversion from the inactive vitamin d to the active vitamin d but as far as an
actual deficiency forty percent at least forty percent i think it's probably more like fifty or
sixty percent uh people in the us and europe are deficient in vitamin d and 85 of people in the
arabic countries have a vitamin d deficiency so what is the significance of that well
it increases the risk of cancer diabetes heart attacks autoimmune diseases why because vitamin d
has everything to do with the integrity of your gut epithelium and since 80 of
your immune system is in the gut if there is a problem in the gut wall you have leaky gut
a lot of these proteins and food particulates can get through and you can have this immune reaction
and develop new antibodies against your proteins and some of these proteins can mimic our own cells
so you start developing antibodies against your own tissues thus the autoimmune condition and
by the way a really good antidote or something to support autoimmune conditions especially as we're
talking about inflammation is vitamin d in higher amounts i've done videos on that then we have the
inflammatory bowel disease connection allergies is an immune problem that's generated usually with a
problem with the gut again a link back to vitamin d then we have asthma children that play outside
in the sun that get a lot of vitamin d seem to go in remission if they have asthma and then we
have dermatitis in psoriasis which is connected to a vitamin d deficiency so you can see the
huge problem being vitamin d deficient during the winter months when people are severely deficient
they start getting depressed they start getting sick more often because the vitamin deficiency
makes you more susceptible to viruses and bacteria and a lot of people gain weight during the winter
because of a vitamin d deficiency now that could be for many reasons it could be that you
just don't have the diversity of the microbes which affects the blood sugars causing you to
have more cravings to carbs and eat more but it could be other reasons as well so just make sure
that you're getting more sun during those months that you can get more sun but during the winter i
would highly recommend start taking a good vitamin d on a regular basis with a minimal amount of 10
000 iu's every single day and start to feed the microbes so then the microbes can then make more b
vitamins and exchange those because you fed them the vitamin d so if you're enjoying my content

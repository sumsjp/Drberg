so this is the video you've been waiting for how does one increase their telomere
length and live longer all right so let me just give you a little background first okay
in your cells you have the center part which is the nuclei okay inside the nucleus you have your
dna and that dna is bundled within structures called chromosomes and the chromosomes carry
the genetic information in the form of genes all right so what is a telomere the greek word
for telomere is broken down into two parts we have telos which means end and morose which means part
it's the end part if we take a look at a shoe string that's what a telomere is it's a little
plastic protective mechanism at the end of your chromosome because the shorter it gets the faster
you age and the more diseases you get as our cells divide our chromosomes need to replicate because
we need this complete set and every time they replicate or divide these telomeres get shorter
and shorter and shorter and many scientists claim that the shorter the telomeres the faster you age
and develop more diseases but there are epigenetic factors that can help you
and even hurt you now epigenetics is about what's above genes what controls your genetics
because you're not limited to your genes there are environmental things there's foods there's herbs
there's things that you can do and avoid that can greatly affect your telomeres and your age
all right are you ready okay here are the things that hurt your telomeres for diet i'm
talking about sugar refined foods etc obesity surprise lack of exercise lack of sleep stress
smoking alcohol and pollution probably know of people that actually fit every single one of those
things and usually they don't live too long so now what are the epigenetic factors that
help increase the telomere length omega-3 fatty acids there's an interesting video that i did
on omega-3 fatty acids that reveals some data in a study that shows that you can extend your life
by five years by consuming regular foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids
that's the fatty fish like the salmon the cod of oil it's the sardines
all right number two astragalus this is an adrenal adaptogen something that helps you
counter stress next one good cola i did a video on this i'll put a link down below alright next one
is green tea now green tea is good for just about everything next one curcumin then we get vitamin d
which is good for about everything as well and foods that are high in zinc oysters
clams shellfish and then we get exercise regular consistent exercise of course with good
recovery right that includes the next one sleep if you have chronic insomnia that is a huge
thing that can hurt you with these telomeres okay keep your stress on the low side and last one
is something that's probably going to really surprise you consuming a healthy diet and if
you're new to my channel i put the link down below of exactly what i'm talking about when i
say healthy diet all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

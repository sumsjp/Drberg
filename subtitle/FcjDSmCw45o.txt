let's talk about another hidden underlying cause of depression and
anxiety and it has to do with your microbiome the good bacteria in your gut
now there's a connection between your brain and your colon through what's
called the vagus nerve it's the longest nerve in the body now what's interesting
about the vagus nerve is that it's a two-way street but only 10% of the
information is going from the brain to the colon whereas if we look at the
communication coming from the colon to the brain that's 90% so in other words
you're getting a lot of feedback in your brain from things that are happening in
your gut especially with all the things that are connected to the good bacteria
now what you need to know which is not really known is that your good bacteria
make neurotransmitters they make a lot of neurotransmitters which are identical
to the ones that your own body makes so here you have these microbes that really
are symbiotic they're working with your body they're not your body they're just
other thing helping you greatly making acetylcholine GABA norepinephrine
serotonin and dopamine all of these neurotransmitters are gonna make you
feel calm stress-free happy so if there's any problem with your microbes
making these that information is transmitted up here and you're not gonna
feel that great this part of the nervous system is part of what's called the
parasympathetic which opposes the sympathetic which is the flight or fight
the parasympathetic is all about rest and digestion and recovery so if there's
stress down here it's gonna travel up here and you're gonna feel it worry
anxiety panic and then depression all these things can occur if your gut is
not right and the reason I'm bringing this up is because if you're not aware
of this and you just decide to go the medical route and you just take drugs
and not know that this is the root cause you might
not ever solve the real problem now also with the microbiome they eat fiber okay
from vegetables and they make as a by-product small chain fatty acids so
these microbes are converting this fiber which is this carbohydrate to a type of
fat and that specific type of fat can provide up to 90 percent of the energy
for the colon cells it also helps improve insulin resistance which has to
do with your blood sugars and it also supports the integrity of your gut
lining so it has a very very important purpose so if you don't have enough
microbes that are making this then guess what you're gonna be tired and that's
gonna feel like you're depressed but you're really just exhausted or tired so
the combination of a lack of these and lack of this could make you feel quite
crummy also if there's inflammation going down here or even if the microbes
move to the small intestine and that's called small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth that can create a lot of stress up here as well because those
microbes in the wrong place are hogging and eating up all your nutrients and
leaving you deficient and creating a B vitamin deficiency and you're gonna feel
stressed from that the point I wanted to make with this video is that there's a
huge huge connection to your state of well-being and your digestion now on the
flip side if you're stressed that can also affect your digestion you've heard
about the concept of being stressed and in getting an ulcer that's why the other
thing to know is that this communication that goes down here also controls enzyme
release acid production hormone release the muscles around the colon so you can
have stomach pain from spasm the increase or decrease speed at which the
colon works so you can have diarrhea or constipation you could have an over acid
stomach and you can have a lack of enzymes which inhibit your ability to
digest food so for more information about how to support a healthy colon

i wanted to create a short video on the six things that men should not be eating all these things
increase estrogen and shut down your testosterone and that's not good because it can affect your
your muscle density your overall endurance your energy your vitality it can trigger
erectile dysfunction a decreased libido it can put on weight it can create man boobs
and the list goes on and on and on all right number one flax now check this out
flax this is a phytoestrogen okay it has way more estrogen than even soy and soy is high in estrogen
so flax is a no-no for men the only situation i would recommend flax
for females is if they actually have low estrogen so flax is something you want to avoid flax seed
anything connected to flax flax oil and then avoid soy and that includes soy protein isolates
that can also increase estrogen all right next one glyphosate and atrazine these are two herbicides
the first one is involved in gmo the second one is just a chemical that they spray on our foods
both of these increase estrogen and so the solution for that is to do organic foods
next one is red dyes red dye has the capacity to increase estrogen pretty
significantly now if you're doing my version of the ketogenic diet which is the healthy version
chances are you're not going to consume any red dyes so i just recommend
you do my version of the ketogenic diet i put a link down below but red dyes not good tap water
especially if you live in the southern part of the united states tap water has significant amounts of
estrogen as well as other bad things as well so you want to get a filter to get that filtered out
i mean you just don't want to drink any tap water this not just estrogen there's a lot of other
chemicals and the thing about water is that most people drink a good amount of water in a given day
so if you're you're drinking a lot of tap water getting all that estrogen that could be the reason
why you may have low testosterone right there okay milk and milk products i'm not saying to
avoid it completely make sure that if you consume it it's from grass-fed cows make sure it's non-gmo
preferably organic and do smaller amounts now i'm not recommending milk but i'm talking about cheese
so just make sure you don't overdo it with the cheese especially if you want to maintain your
healthy testosterone levels hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

you know it's really really important uh when you start keto to have the correct
estimation of what it's going to take to do keto and what to expect because if you're going into
keto with some idea that you're going to lose a certain amount of weight or you're going to be
fully fat adapted at this amount of time when it's really a lot longer it can set you up for a lot of
frustration and you may even quit so in this video i want to give you a more realistic time frame of
really what it takes to become fat adapted now the big goal of keto is to go from sugar burning
to burning fat in past videos i've always mentioned this three days okay it takes three days
that is the start of burning ketones but you're definitely not going to be fully fat adapted
within three days it's just not going to happen especially if we add on
all the other variables age menopause history of having a slow metabolism history of consuming
a lot of carbohydrates a more realistic time frame would be between 4 to 12 weeks
yes not days but weeks in fact for most people it really is gonna start on the fourth
week your body body's finally adapted to fat and you're starting to burn fat this also explains why
most people will lose weight between the first and second week that's mainly water loss okay and
then they may lose a pound the following week and they're thinking wow it's not working when it is
working because this mechanism this transformation of your body creating a new machine to burn fat
just takes a bit of time so i really want to shift your expectations to between
4 and 12 weeks now with athletes like professional athletes could take 12 months why because they're
pushing every single cell in their body and they have to be able to tap into that fat and use it
as energy as quickly as possible now how do you know if you're fat adapted well number one
ask yourself can you exercise while you're fasting with no dip in energy
number two can you go a long period of time without being hungry you don't feel
like you need to take a nap after you eat lunch you can hold your urine through the
entire night without having to get up and peeing several times a night now there's another one
as well within the first week of starting keto the uric acid levels in your blood can double
that's just a normal thing that happens and that can actually create even some gout in your big toe
the uric acid tends to follow the ketone so if your ketones are going up the uric acid will go
up and this is not a bad thing it's just something that occurs but realize that it's going to go away
when you are fat adapted so it could take up to 12 weeks before that completely goes away you just
have to wait until your kidneys have adapted to processing this excessive amount of uric acid if
you wanted to speed things up keep bringing your carbs down lower and lower to even zero and fast
longer and longer longer both of those actions are going to greatly reduce the time it takes
to be fully fat adapted hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

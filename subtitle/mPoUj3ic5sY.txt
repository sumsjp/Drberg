hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the six fat burning hormones okay
now I have done videos on each one separately but we're going to summarize all of them and what to
do to trigger them as well so the first thing is the thyroid hormones primarily t3 that's the
active form of the thyroid hormones the hormone that does all the work you have T 4 which is
the inactive and it converts to t3 through the liver and the kidney into the gallbladder okay
and that's why when you consume bile or you can get make sure the bile works in going through
the gallbladder you can actually increase the conversion because you don't have a gallbladder or
you all those congested or your liver is damaged when fatty this will be really almost impossible
to trigger this thing so anyway I am going to show you how to eliminate things to speed it
up as well but you want to realize that iodine will trigger this I like sea kelp and selenium
okay selenium basically helps the conversion iodine is basically then is the involved in the
hormone so you see this tree right here that means it has three molecules of iodine t4 has
four so that's all you need to know about that so that's the thyroid hormone okay now growth hormone
this is like the most important one it's made by the pituitary it works your liver so a lot
of the hormones will be effective if the liver is working so that's why it's important you know not
necessarily to trigger them but just to get your liver healthy but growth hormone I will help you
burn fat primarily at night but what triggers it is high intensity interval training okay high
intensity interval training moderate amount of protein will trigger growth hormone sleep will trigger
growth hormone fasting will trigger growth hormone the amino acid arginine will trigger
growth hormone okay but insulin and cortisol will block glow hormone so that's why you want to keep
insulin lower and cortisol lower so this would be you know the sugars and things and this would
be stress okay IGF-1 insulin-like growth factor number one okay so a lot of people don't know
about this one but this is very similar to growth hormone it's basically the hormone it does it's
an extension off growth hormone growth hormone triggers of hormone and this is made by the liver
what this one reciprocates with insulin so when you eat insulin takes over when you're not eating
IGF-1 takes over and it goes after your fat and it mobilizes it to energy so this is the fat burning
hormone and what triggers this is intermittent fasting not eating yeah so basically fasting or
intermittent fasting will trigger that that's why snacking is really bad okay glucagon this
is another hormone that opposes insulin and what triggers it is protein okay and intense exercise
exhaustive exercise moderate munna protein now the other thing that will inhibit this
one would be sugar or refined carbs then we have testosterone what triggers testosterone
is drink training full body compound resistance exercise or weight training vitamin D will trigger
testosterone now if you actually increase estrogen or insulin you will block testosterone so keeping
the estrogen low and we into low will basically like testosterone and just so you know I believe
it's really the problem with testosterone and most men is too much estrogen okay then we have
adrenaline adrenaline is triggered by exercise primarily high intensity exercise okay so there
you have it fixed operating hormones and in one video thanks for watching hey guys thank you so

today we're going to talk about how to get a grip on your addictions i'm sorry your cravings now
this is a very important topic because if you have cravings you're going to have a hard time
sticking with keto you're not going to be consistent so you have this little tiny gland in
the brain called the hypothalamus and within that hypothalamus you have a tiny little group of cells
that control appetite and feeling satisfied with foods and so there's information coming
from your eyes from your smell from your taste from your stomach all these perceptions and
they're coming in through the body up to that little center and giving it certain information
and based on what's happening it'll send down signals to the body to tell when you had enough
food or when you should start eating and so let's say there's some reason why you need food it will
start creating the sensation of hunger which is kind of like a an emptiness an uncomfortableness
feeling very unsatisfied so we have various hormones that are affecting this we have leptin
which tells the brain to stop eating it's like a turn off switch now your fat cells make this
hormone the stomach makes it your muscles make it and so it decreases hunger then you have another
hormone called ghrelin which does the opposite it increases hunger it tells the body it's time
to eat and then so they work together and when you eat you stimulate insulin and insulin triggers
leptin eventually causing you to feel satisfied but here's the thing there are other sensors
in your hypothalamic computer that regulate glucose amino acids fatty acids
salts vitamins and even minerals so based on how many nutrients you're consuming coming in the body
that information will go into the brain and then tell the body um to crave certain things
to try to get these nutrients but this is where it breaks down because sometimes when you crave
certain nutrients your body's not going to crave like kale it might crave other things that don't
have that nutrient in it unfortunately now you've probably heard of people who who have
craved like dirt for example to get iron or ice but mainly people are craving things like
bread pasta cereal crackers candy sweets things like that and maybe sometimes you'd be craving
chocolate which has magnesium and one of the reasons why you might crave these grain flour
products is because you're low in b vitamins but here's the problem when you consume these grains
you usually consume them in the form of a refined carbohydrate which basically has
its empty nutrition there's empty calories so when you eat that food you not only trigger insulin and
crad issues like insulin resistance but there's no turn off in the hypothalamus we don't have the
ability to turn that thing off so you're never going to be satisfied and you may already know
this because it's very difficult to consume just a little bit of sweet or refined carbs and as a
way for your brain to cause you to consume certain foods it's going to give you sometimes a pleasure
sensation okay and that works through dopamine and serotonin can increase the happiness sensation and
these foods tend to raise your mood make you feel better decrease stress and pressure for a minute
until the blood sugars start going down and this whole cycle starts
over and over again so junk food including like things with msg give you this artificial sensation
and people literally live for sensation unfortunately the sensation they get is an
artificial sensation it's not long-lasting it doesn't come from things that give you
real good healthy sensations now it's really a trap because refined carbohydrates raise the
insulin and cause insulin resistance and when you get insulin resistance now you can't absorb
your nutrients anymore what is that going to do it's going to make you want that food but not
really become satisfied so that actually keeps the cravings there and keeps you hungry and then
we have foods that are void of nutrition so we never have a chance to satisfy that hypothalamus
and then stop that hunger feedback loop if you have low bile if your gallbladder is missing or
you have a sluggish gallbladder or you have a fatty liver and you can't produce enough bile
you're going to have a difficulty absorbing the fat soluble nutrients from the foods that you eat
and the fat soluble nutrients usually are very satisfying to your brain and especially
the hypothalamus and this is why some people when they start taking purified bile salts
they start feeling more satisfied after they're eating it's also why people when they start keto
and intermittent fasting get rid of their insulin resistance and they become very very satisfied in
fact their hunger goes away their cravings go away and they're very very satisfied because
they're absorbing more nutrients if you're consuming too many carbs your body won't let you
tap into your own fat that means you're running on your your sugars your stored sugar constantly
so it's going to go up and down up and down up and down another reason why you're going to be very
unsatisfied and you just won't have the ability to go for any period of time without needing some
carbs and this relates to the next one which is low blood sugar so anytime you have low blood
sugars you're going to want sugar okay so one very important tip relating to cravings is not only do
you need to cut down your carbs but you need to raise the nutrients you need to eat nutrient-dense
foods especially the foods that are high in the fat soluble vitamins okay cod liver oil is a
really good thing fatty salmon fatty fish and leafy greens and vegetables high in potassium
magnesium folate in vitamin c another important thing would be your environment if you're in
an environment that you're visually seeing food all the time or you're smelling food
or it's just around and you're thinking about all the time those can all trigger the
pleasure neurotransmitter called dopamine and it's triggered by the anticipation of eating something
not when you eat it so when you're looking at a donut for example you're anticipating eating it
you're not getting any of those particles in your eyes that are going into your stomach
or when you're smelling some pizza cooking oven you're getting some particles in your body but
it's not enough to satisfy you but it's definitely going to increase dopamine so it's very important
that you avoid these temptations by changing your environment and not having pictures of food
not seeing food not smelling certain junk foods or temptations going to just be too
high and once you start consuming fast food it is so difficult to stop because of the msg
which is going to trigger hunger it's going to definitely not make you satisfied and it's going
to increase insulin it can increase the insulin by 300 percent they use msg to fatten mice in their
obesity studies by the way so it's very important to address all the issues that we talked about
the difference between a craving an addiction is a craving is a strong desire but an addiction is not
only a strong desire but the inability to stop or resist or control that temptation all right

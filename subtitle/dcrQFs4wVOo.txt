so let's talk about one of the best remedies for cardiac arrhythmias
now whether we're talking about minor palpitations or
atrial fibrillation one of the big problems with a severe
arrhythmia issue is that the blood can pool in different parts of the heart and
create clotting and then that can actually turn into a
stroke when you go to the doctor they'll treat it with either a beta
blocker a calcium channel blocker or digitalis what i want to do in this
video is give you an alternative but of course check with your doctor
before discontinuing any of this medication
that being said the unifying theory or agreement
that most of the medical professionals have about
an arrhythmia is that there's a problem with calcium
calcium is leaking from the cardiac cells
calcium is very very necessary in the body but if there's too much in the
cells that can be very toxic and if there's too much outside
the cell that can be very toxic as well now
there's many different purposes of calcium in the body but one
huge function of calcium is it's a signaling
molecule or a messenger type molecule that causes certain functions
to occur in certain pathways calcium also affects
another signaling molecule which is right here i don't want to get
into the details camp the only thing i want you to know
about this right now is it's another signaling molecule and it
works with calcium when you have arrhythmias
there's going to be a problem with this and a problem with this thus the
medication a calcium channel blocker and another medication used for
arrhythmias called digitalis which affects the sodium calcium
relationship in past videos i talked about potassium
deficiencies and magnesium deficiencies causing arrhythmias and the reason why
these two would work is because both of these
minerals help balance calcium and keep calcium
from becoming too toxic inside the cell and if you have an
advanced arrhythmia you could be pretty deficient in
magnesium and potassium and that could take some time to
fortify your body it could take actually even months
but in the meantime there's a really good remedy that i'm going to recommend
d-ribose and d is actually the natural form of ribose and ribose
is a signaling molecule for this other signaling molecule okay it's kind
of like a precursor or a building block for this right here
because it improves cardiac muscle physiology it's also
recommended when you have cramps or soreness in the muscle after you
exercise so it tends to bypass the damaged
pathways in the heart and it gets the myocardial cells the
heart muscles to work better it also can reduce angina
it's also good for reducing fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome and the dosage
i'm going to recommend would be five grams two
to three times a day you don't want to go over five grams because sometimes it
can actually give you a little digestive problem
maybe it's too much gas or even diarrhea so stick with five grams
two to three times a day and you'll notice that this will give you a lot of
relief some people mix this with their coffee
because caffeine aggravates arrhythmias but adding this to it will
tend to rid the jittery feelings or the abnormal
extra palpitations you may get when you consume
caffeine and i also want to add this you probably already know this but
drinking alcohol causes arrhythmias chronic stress
can cause arrhythmias of course eating food that depletes your potassium
magnesium will cause arrhythmias a lot of refined carbs and sugars and
refined grains and also a diet low in potassium
magnesium and that would be a diet that's low
in vegetables an average american consumes only 1.5 cups of vegetables so
i don't know where they're getting their minerals from but over time that can
lead to problems with the heart also exposure to
emf i've done a video on this in the past
and this is a big problem especially if you're sitting in front of your computer
all day long what's going to happen is the
electromagnetic fields from those electrical devices
can interfere with your own electrical fields and create
arrhythmias just right here so you may want to get that checked definitely work
on these things okay to actually get to the bottom of
the arrhythmias and you may want to start taking this
remedy to give you some relief in the meantime i personally
don't sell this product i don't recommend a brand you're going
to have to do your research on on that part thanks for watching and i
will see you in the next video
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains

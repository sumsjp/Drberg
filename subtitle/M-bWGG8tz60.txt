i want to talk about using apple cider vinegar for your pet primarily your dog there's several really
cool things you can do that creates some really good effects number one if your dog has itchy skin
you could take a solution mixed with fifty percent apple cider vinegar and fifty percent water and
rub it into the skin once a day and of course you don't wanna put it on any type of open wounds or
lesions because that's gonna burn but that itching is gonna go away pretty pretty fast number two
it's great as a flea and tick repellent okay and now my dog charlie many times brings in these
ticks that then are given to me which really uh really irritates me so this could be a potential
solution all right next thing is it helps your dog's blood sugar so if there's any type of
blood sugar issues this could be something that can really help there's many dogs now
nowadays that get diabetes and simple apple cider vinegar is a natural remedy to help that
of course it's good with humans as well number four it's very anti-microbial put some of this
in their water and i'm going to recommend like one teaspoon per week okay actually
they like it they'll actually drink it up it'll help lower the amount of pathogens in their bodies
now they have a very very strong stomach so most the microbes that they eat because they tend to
be scavengers they'll eat things off the floor it'll be killed in the stomach but what if their
ph in their stomach is not strong enough a lot of these microbes can kind of leach into the body
so regular apple cider vinegar in their diet is a very beneficial thing now if your dog has any
type of digestive issue apple cider vinegar can help because it's going to improve their
digestion it has a lot of things in there to help not just the acid but it has friendly bacteria
and other healthy acids and if your dog has allergies apple cider vinegar would be a great
remedy to give them but you have to give it to them for quite some time for it to work
sometimes it could take up to two months so anyway i wanted to bring this up because a
lot of you have pets and you may not know this viable connection between apple cider vinegar
and your pet's hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

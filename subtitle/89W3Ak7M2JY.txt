so today I'm going to talk about why apple cider vinegar works for muscle
spasm now typically when someone has a muscle spasm they usually go for
electrolytes and a lot of times that actually may work but when it doesn't
work you may want to try some apple cider vinegar to your diet and I'm going to
tell you why that may help you now before I get into that this is a diagram
of a muscle and two tendons okay so you have the tendons that attach to bones
and then you have the muscle and in the tendon you have this little receptor
called the Golgi tendon organ that picks up information from the load of the
muscle okay so there's there's information being sent from the muscle
based on tension that is being picked up by this tendon and carried to the
nervous system to the spinal column up to the brain to associated muscles and
then back up to this muscle so when you lift something up at a certain weight
and you feel the heaviness of that that's all being sensed and perceived by
this tendon and the information sent to the brain and gives you a feedback loop
of how much resistance that you need to use to actually lift it up there's a lot
of control over this muscle dynamic from the nervous system okay and the
receptors and there's certain chemical compounds that you need that communicate
between the muscles and the nerve and one of the big ones is acetylcholine and
it just so happens that apple cider vinegar can contribute to the formation
of this chemical we need electrolytes which are electrically charged minerals
for the electrical part of this problem you need a set of choline which is a
neurotransmitter to allow that to work and lastly if your pH is too alkaline
one of the symptoms for alkalosis is cramping one remedy for cramping in
general would be just to acidify the body to bring the pH down a little bit
so then this muscle contraction and relaxation can happen normally if you
have a cramp in your body and you're wondering what's going on yes you want
to look at the electrolytes but you also want to look at the pH and you may need
to acidify it without cider vinegar but you can also use pickle juice
because that's an acidifier as well as kombucha tea but the reason apple cider
vinegar might work a little bit better than these other ones is that it can
help increase this neurotransmitter and that's involved in the nerve
connection to that muscle if you're taking electrolytes and you still have
cramps don't forget about the apple cider vinegar you can dilute it by
taking a tablespoon and a glass of water 8 to 12 ounces drink that a couple times
a day all right thanks for watching
we're back with another amazing
recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to check
this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself

let's talk about some of the benefits of chlorophyll okay chlorophyll is that green
thing in plants it's actually a pigment and plants use it with the sun's help to make energy okay so
we're going from a light energy ray to a chemical storage of energy now number one
it has the ability to counter the negative effects of consuming meat sometimes when you
overcook meat it gives off a byproduct that could create some negative health effects but when you
combine chlorophyll that will help to reduce those effects this is why you want to combine vegetables
with meat or a salad with your meats number two it can act as a natural deodorizer if you have body
odor you have bad breath you need to be consuming things with higher amounts of chlorophyll number
three it can act as a blood builder the chemistry of chlorophyll is literally identical to your own
blood except for your blood has iron whereas chlorophyll has magnesium which i'm going to
get to in a second so if someone has anemia they want to be consuming more chlorophyll type foods
number four skin okay so there's a lot of cool things that chlorophyll can do for your skin
decrease photo aging the aging spots from the sun it can also decrease acne and oily skin
number five it has anti-inflammatory properties as well as anti-cancer properties
number six ulcers if someone has an ulcer chlorophyll is a good antidote because it
has healing properties especially for the internal skin of your body whether it's part of the sinuses
the lungs the esophagus or the inside of your intestine chlorophyll is very good to reduce
inflammation and help with ulcers chlorophyll can also decrease your appetite and at the heart
of chlorophyll you have this mineral magnesium which i already mentioned which is involved in
300 different enzymes it's involved in making atp which is the energy currency system of the body
and also it's involved in decreasing oxidation to help with oxidative stress and so just make
sure you have enough green stuff in your diet now i'm not talking about pistachio
ice cream or lime green jello i'm talking about vegetables or wheatgrass juice powder

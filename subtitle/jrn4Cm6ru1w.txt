now you probably heard the expression you are what you eat well not on keto there's a very
interesting study done comparing the ketogenic diet high fat low carb to the opposite diet which
is low fat high carb and they wanted to look and evaluate how much saturated fat was in the
bloodstream after being on this diet and of course it's obvious that if you eat all this dietary fat
it's going to load up your arteries and probably spill off into your reserve but that's actually
not what happened the group that had the lowest amount of fat and the highest carb had the highest
amount of saturated fat floating through their bloodstream so for those of you that are scared
to do the ketogenic diet thinking that it's going to fill up your arteries with fat that's not
what happens despite having the low carb high fat group at three times as much dietary fat
it was the low fat high carb group that should be most concerned so the question is why well carbs
control where the fat goes when your carbs are low the body starts using those dietary fats
as fuel and if your carbs are high your body's not going to be using the saturated fats it's going to
be using the carbohydrates as fuel and then the excess fat is going to be stored in the fat cells
not to mention the carbs being also converted to saturated fats in the bloodstream as well
that's called de novo lipogenesis carb into fat so is saturated fat that bad for you it really
depends on where your carbs are if your carbs are too high yes saturated fats are unhealthy
but if you're on the ketogenic diet with low carb the dietary fat goes to the front of the line
as your fuel hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

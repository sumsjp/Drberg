today we're going to talk a little bit about wormwood extract this is one of the best
remedies for parasites there was a study that i reviewed and i'll put the link down below
that showed that wormwood was just as effective as anti-parasitic medication so what is it good for
it's good for pinworms round worms tape worms and malaria which is a disease caused by a parasite
in mosquitoes and if you have malaria the best way to take this wormwood would be in a tea the active
compound in wormwood is called third zone and there's an alpha and a beta the alpha version is
a bit toxic in fact it can cause hallucinations and what's interesting is quite a few artists
in the past have taken wormwood to create this altered state to somehow become more creative in
their arts in fact the artist van gogh took it of course i'm not recommending this for that purpose
but wormwood has a lot of different compounds to create some real interesting effects
if you're pregnant you need to avoid it if you're breastfeeding avoid it if you have epilepsy
if you're a child you need to avoid it check with your doctor before taking this of course and also
if you take it only take it for four weeks at a time don't take it long term so it's good
number one for parasite it causes the parasites to become paralyzed and then they die number two
it's also very good for irritable bowel syndrome especially crohn's and i also found it's good for
the inflammation in the kidney and it can help someone with their digestion because it increases
stomach acid as well as the release of bile so you have less bloating and less gas all right that was

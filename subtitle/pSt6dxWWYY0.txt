hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about nighttime
hypoglycemia okay that's a situation where you wake up with a headache you
have sleeping problems you're tired but you can't sleep you got sweating around
your neck specifically you're hungry you're shaking so you have this blood
sugar issues now yeah the one thing that I want to mention about that is that
usually a lot of people that have this are already diabetics on insulin okay
and they're taking a little too much insulin driving it lower if you're
taking insulin or metformin and your blood sugar drops down to low my advice
would be to get with your doctor to back off the medication because it's working
too much if you have too much in Flint it's going to end up below 100 so why
not back off versus what a lot of people do is they walk around with a little
sugar in their pocket and eat this candy to try to raise the sugar just so called
correct it but the problem is it's going to keep coming up and down so the worst
thing you do is do six meals a day it's never going to cracked it's going to
keep it going you want to get with your doctor to back off the medication
because you're taking too much okay I mean the purpose of the medication is
to lower the blood sugar but not lower all the way down that but let's say for
example you're not a diabetic okay and you have this hypoglycemia either did at
night or whenever and you go get a test and it comes out normal blood sugars
there's a condition called idiopathic postprandial syndrome which basically
means if you Pathak is a word that means unknown cause post after perennial meal
syndrome so they don't know what's causing this after effect of the meal
okay this after blood sugar effect so that's what they named it so it's kind
of like an unknown bunch of symptoms that doesn't show up on a blood test but
you have the symptoms and hopefully they won't tell you you're faking it because
it's actually legitimate so here's what I think that's going on with
hypoglycemia especially if it doesn't show up in a blood test
what happens there's a condition called insulin resistance most of you know what
that is where the cells are resisting insulin and the reason why they're
resisting it is because the body is rejecting and trying to protect you
against too much sugar so it's going to block it eventually if you have too much
sugar so then in cells because we're not getting the insulin we don't an insulin
as a key that allows the fuel to go in the cell now we end up with a cell with
low amounts of fuel energy or even glucose so we basically have a situation
worried we have low blood sugar in the cell it's like hypoglycemia the cell and
your you have all these sensors are going to pick up you're going to have
these symptoms here you're going to crave sweets you know if your cells are
starting to sugar you're going to crave sweets especially if your brain cells
are starving the sugar that's going to send a signal back to the pancreas that
we're low in sugar and then we're going to raise insulin and guess what that's
going to do it's going to drive the blood sugar down even lower so
hypoglycemia is a situation where we have too much insulin that pushes the
sugar down below where it should be well one cause of too much insulin would
be insulin resistance so really hypoglycemia is an insulin resistance
situation that starts at a very low level and it gradually increases over
time and be interesting if you have this and you have normal blood sugars to get
a fasting insulin test to see what's going on I bet you that would be very
high beep right ten twenty or thirty so it should be a lot lower but the point
is that if you have these nighttime hypoglycemic reactions
chances are you have insulin resistance and that means that you need to fix it
using food and the way to do it is not to have five meals a day the way to do
it is to conclude consume food that's higher in things that a type of food
that doesn't increase insulin so in other words we want to avoid the
stimulation of insulin that's the goal so we want to avoid carbs
refined carbs and sugar for sure and fruit we want to avoid all that fat will
help you fat will actually not increase insulin it will make you satisfied so
you can go longer without eating eating in general triggers insulin so you're
going to have to not eat as frequent it's called in a minute fasting so just
start with three meals a day and add more fat have a good amount of greens
salad vegetables have a moderate amount of protein and and if you do that over a
period of two or three weeks your body will start to adapt the insulin will
come down your blood Sugar's will level out and you will no longer get
hypoglycemia now in the transition phase if you have still have symptoms in your
transitioning through this and it's rough instead of eating sugar you can
have protein protein will trigger the opposing hormone to insulin called
glucagon and it will raise sugar okay so that's just a side note because what
we're trying to do is we're trying to fix this insulin spike that's kind of
over exaggerating bringing this thing down here okay so anyway I hope that
gave you some idea of what's really behind this and the thing not to do is
to continue the sugar pills and then also if you're on medication get with
your doctor to make the adjustments and even if you're diabetic I recommend
doing the intermittent fasting as well as the ketogenic diet alright thanks for
watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down
below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root
cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and
we'll send you report

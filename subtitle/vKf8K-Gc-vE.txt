today let's talk about tanning beds can you actually get your vitamin d
from getting a tan in your tanning bed now before i answer that question i want to explain
something about getting your vitamin d from sun now the sun doesn't shoot down vitamin
d into your body okay what it does is it emits a wavelength a frequency an energy that penetrates
a certain layer of your skin and in that layer of your skin it's like the fourth layer down
it triggers cholesterol to create a change chemically into vitamin d but at that stage
it's only an inactive form of vitamin d3 it's a pre vitamin d3 so the sun's energy interacts with
cholesterol to make vitamin d3 now that inactive vitamin d has to be then activated through
two other organs the liver and especially the kidney so if you have damage in your liver or
kidney you're not going to convert into the active form if you have more pigment in your skin let's
say it's darker that will block this conversion and if you're older that's going to block this
conversion if you're overweight that can block this conversion so there's a lot of things
that can inhibit you from achieving your optimum vitamin d levels now here's the
important thing that you need to know now that wavelength called uv or ultraviolet
is not just one wavelength it's made up of three so it's three different wavelengths
the one that makes vitamin d is uv ultraviolet b the ultraviolet
a wavelength does not make vitamin d and that's the one that they use in the tanning beds
so if you're getting that wavelength you're not getting vitamin d the problem with being exposed
to uva is it penetrates deeper it can actually create genetic damage into the dna
and 95 of the uv rays are this type so if it has the ability to create genetic damage and tan your
skin or even age your skin and it doesn't end up helping you increase your conversion of vitamin d
it can increase the risk of melanomas now with the sun you're getting uvb you're getting uva you're
getting uvc and you're getting other things as well but a tanning bed only has that uv a and so
the key thing about this topic is whether you get vitamin d or not because vitamin d is protective
against cancer it's anti-cancer it's anti-melanoma and your susceptibility of getting cancer
and as you become deficient in vitamin d your susceptibility of getting cancer goes
way up so for that reason tanning beds come with a package you might get a tan but you don't get
that protective vitamin d to protect you against skin cancer and other problems now it's very very
difficult to get your vitamin d from food for example three ounces of salmon this will only
give you 447 international units of vitamin d3 three ounces of tuna only give you 154 iu's three
ounces of mackerel fish is 388. three ounces of beef liver is only 42 international units
and one egg only gives you 41 international units and for most people that either are overweight
have malabsorption issues have diabetes i mean they need between 6,000 to 10,000 IUs
every single day now i forgot to mention one tablespoon of cod liver oil will give you 1360
IU's of vitamin d3's so it gives you a lot more than any of the other foods all right guys thanks
for watching and i have a lot of videos on vitamin d3 and i put some up right here check them out

another special guest Rita and uh the
reason I'm bringing Rita on is because
she's been going through some stress and
uh with her getting back on her program
and I wanted to use this as an um kind
of a like teaching tool to help people
who get off track get getting back on
track so welcome Rita
thanks
hey Rita can you just give me a
thumbnail sketch um you were doing good
at one time right you were doing great
you're on the program you're losing
weight you're feeling great and then you
kind of went through some stuff right
I did yeah
um tell us a little bit about that well
I tell you it really wasn't the stuff
that knocked me off track it was me
going back to my emotional eating
thinking that that would comfort me and
I knew it the whole time I knew it every
single first couple bites I was like
this isn't even good I don't even like
it
but I did it as a uh just a habit
because that's what I always did before
was emotional eat
um so yeah that's how I went off track
and then the stress really I feel like
put on the weight pretty quick
yeah I could only imagine and uh so
there guys if you're watching this if
you had a similar thing there's various
reasons why people go to food and why
they eat you know you have people that
are relieving stress you have people who
relieve emotional pain physical pain
they're either boredom they eat because
they have to eat everything on their
plate because they don't want to waste
any food they and then you have people
that eat for health and because they're
hungry and then you got people that eat
for pleasure because it tastes good so
there's many different motivations
um so specifically you've been eating
for to relieve stress right
okay yeah and because I thought I
remembered that it tasted good but it
doesn't ever actually it's kind of weird
because even though I'm still eating for
stress
um and I'm trying to get back on keto
I I still don't think it tastes as good
it's like after I went keto nothing is
as satisfying as what I thought it was
interesting do you ever eat when you're
not hungry
oh yeah okay yeah because because now my
body has gotten used to the the carb
intake again and I don't feel that
satisfying feeling that I did when I was
on keto just that feeling of always
being
perfectly satisfied like when I was on
keto I want that back so bad I have to
get back on it
I know
um and so so tell me what specific foods
that you can't resist that you have to
eat
I'm I'm
changed since I was on keto because we
can't really have a specific food
anymore that makes me satisfied that
makes that I can't resist so that what
foods are you what foods are you eating
that you shouldn't be eating okay
um probably sweets that's all that was
always my go-to before keto and I guess
sweets and
um
maybe bread but mostly sweets probably
what kind of sweets
ready sweets so like cakes cake so cake
and frosting
no just cakey kind of so it's like the
the dough the the kind of the wheat part
of the cake probably it's it's like yeah
because I'm looking for that filling
feeling that I had on keto but I
it's like I get spurts
um another thing that I did that I
really think knocked me off very bad and
I'm working on that specifically right
now is alcohol
okay that right there
was probably the ultimate
um derailleur
um of what I was doing I uh I I tried it
out because I I wasn't you know I didn't
do alcohol before
um keto but I tried it because I'm like
well I'm doing good on keto and
everything let me just add this alcohol
to relieve my stress
and that
uh you know you know if you're gonna if
you're not working right in the braid
then you then I kind of went to my
emotional eating when I was you know
um under the influence like that you
know you get you get hungry after you go
have a night out or whatever and then
you just come home and and I just eat
crap and I would think the whole time
like back in my brain I'm like this is
not
what I'm supposed to be doing and this
alcohol is just not helping so right now
I'm really working on
um not stress drinking and I'm doing
pretty good at that and I felt like that
was like the first thing I really really
needed to do because
because if I can get back on keto
I don't want to I don't want to have an
alcoholic binge and then go and have
some a bad night and then get
re-addicted to it right
um okay so I just want to give you some
tips on that uh because there's a couple
things that
that will help
um what happens when people are um off
track
um
they get in this old habit type thing
and um these old habits are just kind of
totally connected to the Past right
they're not connected to present so you
have to do things to keep you in the
present what would that mean well the
first thing is that I would highly
recommend
um and this is just something you have
to do keep it a food log
um and actually document everything and
for the for the only purpose of keeping
you in the present and then so you write
down on the left side all the foods that
you eat through the day or drink
um and then what you do on the right
side right next to it is you're writing
down uh your motivation
why why are you doing it
um because
that's going to force you as an exercise
to keep you
conscious
aware
it keeps you looking at what you're
doing because
if I'm gonna right now punch my hand
through that wall
um
I can punch it but it's going to hurt
but if I if I'm just very aware of
that's going to hurt you know it's like
I'm going to be very conscious
you know I could do it but I already
knew I was doing it consciously and I
heard myself I can actually live with
that versus
people that tend to get in this almost
like Mindless automaticity this
automatic thing that they're doing and
they're like it's below their awareness
it's kind of weird now then if you add
alcohol then you're even less conscious
and then you do it more so it's all
about
bringing you in more into the present
and keep you in the present so and what
does that mean it means being connected
to your environment right connected so
like going for a long walk and actually
observing trees and things versus in
your head you know
right like when you're walking or what
about people when they're driving you
look around very few people are in the
present they're just driving along on
automatic they probably even look at the
road I don't even know how they get
through and don't crash right we gotta
like put you
um keep you in the present and I think
keeping a food log every single day and
then writing down everything you eat and
then that's gonna like force you to just
be more aware so that's number one right
okay
um number two is going to be
um
we got to make it we have to change some
of the motivation
um to eat while you're eating
so these other ways of just getting into
trouble
um but we have to change the motivation
the the two good reasons to eat would be
um to eat for health eat fruit nutrients
fulfill hunger but the pleasure thing I
think you can also get pleasure through
through eating healthy I think I think
you should also in your house prepare
a lot of so-called Healthy Junk foods
like like the keto desserts and stuff
and cookies so you just keep it in the
house so at least you have a go-to that
has an alternative form of junk food
right
um now let's shift to the alcohol
I I just found out like at at some of
the
um health food stores especially we in
our area we have something called moms
and you could probably find this they
sell Kombucha tea with
5.6 alcohol
right now that's uh that's like
equivalent to a very strong beer that
you would buy in Canada because I know I
think in America it's like it might be
three or four percent alcohol
but as a transition off
the crappy alcohol you can actually do
kind of a
kind of a keto alcohol drink and the
reason I'm saying that is that
um I drank some of that about two weeks
ago just to test it out and
wow it's like no negative reactions like
I felt really relaxed but I didn't feel
drunk at all but I just it kind of gave
you a stress relief
and even regular Kombucha tea has a very
very small amount of alcohol it just
kind of is going to relax you and it's a
way to get the same texture and give you
some alternative rather than the actual
alcohol itself that's going to create
more problems for you
um
so then then the third thing is so
number one get you to be aware write
down everything
as a standard thing every single day for
a period of time okay change your
motivation
you know for health
um and then once you get you start doing
it more it's going to be easier and
easier the problem with keto is that
it's it's really all or nothing because
what gets you in the keto is lowering
your carbs if you do it sort of and you
have a little more carbs then you're not
really in keto and now you're gonna once
you get off now you're off now you're
gonna roller coaster so it's like I
think once you get into it for just like
a little bit more time right because now
you're out okay I got momentum here
um okay so now we have to make it easier
by um
also
um
changing your environment
in other words you have to make it a
point not to hang out at the bar anymore
or wherever you go I don't know where
you go
um but you don't want to hang out and
like you don't want to go to the bakery
and hang out in the afternoons
like change your environment so this
stuff is not in your face
you probably have friends
that are not maybe the best influences
I'm just guessing and like you need to
kind of choose your friends a little bit
more wisely and not hang out with these
people that throw you off as much maybe
you hang out with um some keto friends
I don't know
I'm just wondering there's people also
uh that you can
because I tell you like especially in
the worst thing is groups
like you need to be careful not to go to
too many social groups because it gets a
little crazy like everyone's oh yeah
let's party let's go off the program
let's drink it and it's really hard to
be the odd man out or the odd person out
to not do it too right I mean especially
family gatherings social
parties oh my gosh holidays is the worst
I'm sure that might not be real to you
but I don't know I'm kind of dreading
because my very very very favorite aunt
is coming in and we kind of feed off of
each other
so I'm a little I'm I am dreading
um not that she's coming I love that
she's coming but what am I gonna how am
I gonna Veer her away from our
particular shots right oh my gosh
so so at the summer we did a keto Summit
and we had a um a dinner a platinum
dinner and we served
these drinks that were no alcohol but
they're like I think it was like
cranberry they taste like alcohol drinks
without the alcohol what you should do
this is what you should do
be a trendsetter you should serve don't
even tell her
don't even tell it's not alcohol just do
the kombucha shots
um and then also do
um some keto friendly cookies and stuff
and I think she probably will go wow
this is really good alcohol I feel
really great on this this is wonderful I
don't know you're gonna have to figure
that out but yeah well I'm gonna have to
figure that out for sure we just take
the bottle and slam it so there's no
there's no getting past tricking her but
I I am I'm just gonna have to be upfront
and just say no and so so if I can do
that I know I can get back on keto
because me and her are just ridiculous
together so it's really good I know
about that I know yeah because it's
these people really
can throw you off
um because I do know that you know I
have
I have an addictive nature so I find
that when I try to trick myself into
doing something opposite
I don't think for me that that is really
a good thing
um even with the the keto desserts and
stuff at this very Point okay it's not a
good thing for me but I have made them I
do make them because my family they
actually like them so and it makes me
happy to give them healthy desserts and
me not have to have bad desserts in the
house
so if I didn't happen to grab something
that's what it is so you probably just
need to go all or nothing and just not
even go yeah that's what I did last time
that's what I did last time and you know
my mindset last time was
eliminate sugar I knew I had to do that
but in my mind instead of saying you
can't have sugar I just did your uh you
five to seven cups of dark green leafy
vegetables that's what I did I did a um
asparagus and broccoli and salads and I
made sure that I had five to seven cups
of that every single day that was my
number one rule so instead of saying I
can't I was like I have to do this after
that
we'll figure it out you know but I do
need to eliminate sugar but the feeling
that started coming over my body when I
did that was I didn't even warn it after
a year I could say no to Cheesecake
which that's my very very very favorite
like I can't resist cheesecake uh I
guess you said what can I not resist
that would be one thing that I would
probably not be able to resist but when
I had
all of those vegetables and I did it
um made sure I had my vegetables
basically
and also fact it was um I found out at
that time that whenever I feel like I
need something or I'm hungry again I
found out that um that that really kept
me
um
feeling satisfied but I take a
tablespoon of coconut oil when I was
doing keto and if I felt like I needed a
snack I'd take a tablespoon of coconut
oil and a little bit of peanut butter
with it that was like perfect sugar fat
ratio for me and I was fine like I
didn't want anything else
um that's what I did then so now I'm
back I'm
I feel good about my not drinking um I'm
a little nervous about my aunt coming in
but I feel good about how I haven't gone
to that for stress I've kind of replaced
it with food which is not good but now
that I'm over the the alcohol thing but
now I feel like I can I need to get back
on to making sure I get my vegetables at
least something something has to change
right now because I'm good with alcohol
good
I'll let you know about my aunt right
right
yeah well that's good yeah so that's why
um you know we're just trying to improve
the situation right now make it easier
make it less intense
um
you know and then you build you build
yourself up through basically saying no
like okay no I in in having that
willpower is basically the ability to
say no and resist certain Temptations
right so so if you can do that and keep
strengthening that because it's like an
exercise but I will say
um there's always a situation that
throws you off because stress puts you
out of the present it knocks you on the
presence not really good yes I like that
I don't think you're saying that because
that is very true that is so true
um I really felt like I need to be
grounded like I need to just
just ground myself at this point it's
like okay I'm I'm done going to alcohol
all the time but now I'm feeling like
I need to get on a path right now
there's something kind of missing so I
love that you said that yeah good
yeah so we just make it as simple as
possible from now on you're creating a
food log you're writing everything down
that will help you and then also you're
writing down want you're like you're
like looking at why am I eating this
okay
okay write that down and then just by
looking at that
um it'll help you because it keeps you
from this mindless automatic thing
that's kind of running you in the
background
um and then what you can do
um today you want to start tomorrow
is you're going to just basically start
with your keto meal today so your next
meal when you get hungry don't and
here's the other thing if you can um
try like heck not like
if you eat when you're not hungry
that's going to keep you eating because
you drop the blood sugars down so one
really important piece of information is
to don't eat unless you're hungry and
that's kind of like a discipline of
focusing on not eating which which
eliminates all the reasons for eating
because you're not eating and it'll
actually the fasting improves your
cognitive function so your your these
addiction addictive things tend to kind
of chill out a little bit
so and then you go to your uh meal and
then you're gonna have like your salad
your huge salad moderate protein
and then your fat so those is just focus
on those
keep it simple and then um make sure
your dog's on keto as well I know
and then um and then go as long as you
can
till that you get hungry don't even try
to set up a pattern of I'm gonna do this
pattern of intermittent fasting just
wait until you're hungry and then eat
okay good I'm gonna go longer because
the what happens is when you don't eat
is that the brain starts to you start
regrowing
certain brain cells which is kind of
cool
so it'll actually help
um
help everything
because you'll be more in the present
so
so that is your plan let's keep it
simple
um do you feel like that can actually
work for you
I absolutely feel like the journaling is
a wonderful start to
getting in touch with what I'm doing why
I'm doing it and staying accountable to
myself yes yeah I think that that can
really help me get back on track good
yeah it's uh this will be like um the
awareness the new awareness of just
keeping aware of what you're doing
because it's like sometimes you're like
wow
I didn't realize it was doing the last
month okay
yeah that's awesome
okay so you got a plan so uh go ahead
and start and uh let's do an update um
in a little bit and see how you're doing
because we do want to do a follow-up
with you uh probably a month from now
and I just I want to hear great success
okay
all right no pressure
we're doing the follow-up in about a
month so
um the next thing is just to go ahead
and start today
all right Dr Berg okay all right thanks
for uh doing this interview
thank you you're welcome all right

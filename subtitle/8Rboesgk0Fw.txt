let's talk about intermittent fasting for adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
there's some really fascinating research on this that shows that both intermittent fasting and
prolonged fasting you know as in 72 hours can greatly affect the frontal lobe of your brain
and it can create significant improvements in cognition i'm talking about concentration
focus memory clarity creativity those are your cognitive functions but the study relates to
improving the front part of your brain which is involved with paying attention making decisions
helping you organize and plan because they found if they actually disconnect that part of the
brain and destroy it you will not be able to pay attention you won't be able to decide anything
you can't organize and you definitely won't be planning now it's interesting to me that when you
do research on adhd the experts will say that it's the chemical imbalance but it's never been proven
or it's genetics or the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms and um they don't know why they
don't know how but we still have to do research to see if that's true or not in the meantime we have
some medications for you well the problem with the medications is they have side effects okay and the
side effects sometimes create the exact same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of now if
you're new to my channel and you're not familiar with what fasting can do basically what happens is
we stop feeding the brain glucose so as a survival mechanism the body switches over to making
a preferred source of fuel it's called ketones and your neurons love ketones more than glucose in
fact if the neurons had a choice between glucose and ketones they would always use the ketones
now there are certain parts of your brain that need glucose but your body can make that glucose
out of fat out of protein out of non-carbohydrate sources so you don't need to be consuming glucose
to feed the brain glucose but when you fast you give it ketones and ketones do many wonderful
things for the brain but one of the big things it will do is improve your cognitive functions
and so if you haven't tried it before i highly recommend you give it a try especially if you
have any problems in focusing concentrating having problems with clarity i would also add vitamin b1
in the form of nutritional yeast i would add some zinc and i would add omega-3 fatty acids
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

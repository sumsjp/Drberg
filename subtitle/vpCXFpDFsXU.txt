you know you need to look at fasting as an exercise for your willpower what is willpower
willpower is the ability to control your thoughts and your actions to do what you want it's like the
power of self-control it's your personal power to overcome things like temptations
cravings addictions your willpower helps you stick to something but it's kind of like a
muscle that needs to be developed and strengthened and you can do this through intermittent fasting
so really when you do intermittent fasting it's a exercise or a workout to improve your
willpower your ability to stick to something now some people will say well i don't have
the willpower to do intermittent fasting but fasting increases your ability to do more fasting
so really you just need to do it and get started and then it'll get easier and easier and easier
why because it removes the barriers to do fasting in the first place it gets rid of your hunger it
gets rid of your cravings bad habits because you're it's a training exercise just like when
i was in the army i had to go through a series of training exercises that improved my discipline
and my willpower same thing with wrestling and playing the guitar so you go through a series
of exercises to build up a new ability and then the only barrier probably would be left would be
your love for food and i can't help you with that one but there are some things that you can
do if you're new to my channel to start with to start to get into intermittent fasting so you can
greatly enhance your willpower number one start intermittent fasting without keto so pretty much
just eat what you normally eat but just add in fasting okay skip your breakfast so that way
you have two meals no snacking you can add mct oil which is a fat that will greatly help your ability
to fast there's something called the bulletproof coffee you can have in the morning i'll put a link
down below of how to do that and that's going to definitely help you fast through the morning then
your first meal will be at like 12 second meal at six and right there that's going to be your start
then as you do it things become easier you add keto you lower your carbs what's that going to
do lowering your carbs will make it easier to fast longer because you're not going to add sugar in
there to influence your blood sugars and then the last thing i would do is i would take all
the foods that you really love like as far as the desserts and the junk food and find a replacement
for them i have a lot of ideas i put a link down below of the most common things that people love
and how to make those keto friendly and lastly i want you to do me a favor i want you to rate
your current willpower on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being no willpower 10 being amazing willpower

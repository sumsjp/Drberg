now i saw this study on push-ups in relationship to the group of people who can do more push-ups
have less heart disease there was a cohort study involving over a thousand people and
they showed a significant negative association between baseline push-up capacity and incidents
in cardiovascular disease risk for over 10 years so they compared participants who can do
40 or more push-ups to people who can only do 10 or less push-ups now personally i don't
think that being able to do more push-ups will decrease your risk for heart attacks but
i think people that can do more push-ups are more fit
usually they're more healthy and just as a side note i'm very curious how many push-ups can you do
put it in the comments down below i want to read that and check it out what i am more interested in
is how much did this study cost and who pays for these studies because what they should be studying
which is way more important is the causation of heart disease since it's the number one killer
they should be doing studies in the relationship between how cardiovascular disease starts it
starts with inflammation in the inner lining of your arteries the inflammation develops plaquing
hardening of the arteries and then it starts to obstruct blood flow now you also have clots
that can develop and cause heart attacks which is slightly different and those clots can break
off and go right into your brain and give you a stroke so the question is does push-ups reduce
inflammation and the answer is i don't think so what does increase inflammation is the chronic
consumption of refined sugar now by the way when you consume sugar with vitamins the vitamins
protect against inflammation fyi not that i'm telling you to do that but the fact is that
the majority of the population is consuming the refined sugars they should study diabetics with
the amount of excess glucose floating through the inside of their arteries i think refined oils are
at the top of the list too that's high in omega-6 highly inflammatory then you have refined flowers
you have smoking you have stress and the big one is vitamin e deficiency if you have enough
vitamin e in your body you can protect against a lot of problems in the inside of the artery simply
because vitamin e is one of the most powerful antioxidants for cardiovascular problems because
vitamin e protects against oxidation on the inside of your arteries i mean i could probably
bet that if you compared people who can do a lot more pull-ups against the group that
does a lot less pull-ups they're probably going to have less heart disease people that can bike
longer than people that can't or people that can hike longer than people that can't
will have a decreased heart risk not because the exercise itself is just because they probably have
a healthier lifestyle now if you haven't seen my recent video on reversing cardiovascular disease
i put it down below check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

Hi Guys Dr berg here I had a request to
Do a video on burping so I'm going to
talk about What is the Cause of burping
now mainly chronic burping and you can
also burp from carbonate water and
drinking beer and these other things but
I'm talking about chronic burping or belch
it's the same thing burping and
belch is exact Same thing so there's
really three possibilities um One is
your stomach does not have enough stomach
acid and If It doesn't have
enough stomach acid you'll Get
incomplete digestion especially a
protein and you Get some Gas Building up
and It will regurgitate come back up to
the esophagus Ok It's number one it's
probably the most common thing number
Two low bile What is bile bile is like the
thing that the that helps you dissolve
fat it's like the detergent
that helps you Break down the grease
it's in the gallbladder and bile is
necessary in a certain High
concentration to help you digest fatty
Foods And also extract fat cy of vitamins
if you don't have enough bile Uh
you're going to get incomplete
digestion and have Gas as well Ok how do
you well I'll get to that in a second
and then pancreas If the pancreas is
insufficient with releasing enough
enzymes then you're going to have
incomplete digestion and you're going to
get Gas because you're not Breaking down
food so really burping and beling is the
incomplete digestion of food and you can
also combine the wrong Foods to Fruit
with a Steak you know and it's Just
incomplete digestion Again so and create Gas
or some people can't digest the
fibers of vegetables or especially Fruit
or beans and they're going to get
burping from that And also intestinal Gas
so um here's the thing How do we
know Which is which um You
can go by symptoms you know or
you can Get a test you could it's quite
invasive But I like to Just do the
simple kind of a checklist um If the
stomach is low in acid you're going to have
indig so Uh food will um won't
really digest and you probably have some intestinal
Gas and heartburn too so If
that's the case then you need more acid
Apple cid of vinegar highly recommend it
you can also Get it in pills that should Take
care of the the burping or Just
start taking Ups of vinegar and see If
the burping goes away All Right adding
more acid will actually help you
increase more bile release too so that's
pretty cool How do you know if you need
more bile you're going to have right
shoulder pain maybe headaches pain on
the right side and Uh you might it blo
and burping and beling and um Any number
of things like constipation
ended abdomen after you eat Uh
especially underneath pain underneath
the right rib Cage so that would be gall
bladder or low bile and then enzymes so
if you're deficient enzymes well that
could be you know you have floating
stool but a floating stool could be low
bile too Uh oily waste like you go to the
bathroom it's real oily and Of
course you have Gas as well um
but you know with the problem with
the pancreas is that so many People have
insulin problems and insulin resistance
and diabetes and that's actually a part
of the pancreas controls that Blood
sugar and then the other part controls
the enzymes I will guarantee if you have a
problem with insulin you have a
problem with the pancreas with enzymes
because They both um eating becoming a diabetic
and having insulin resistance destroys
the pancreas decrease the
function of that pancreas so you might need to
support it but the way to Do it
is to fix the ins resistance and All
this starts coming up More and More and
more eating a lot of cooked Foods can
destroy the pancreas roasted nuts and
you're Just living on roast nuts you're
not doing anything raw that can really
mess up the pancreas and increase the
size of the pancreas over time cuz it
has to work harder so um the easiest
thing to do is to take some enzymes and
see If the burping goes away so these
are Just All Just things that you can test I would
start with alps of vinegar
because it's easiest it's the most
common thing that People need to kind of
correct things and then start eating healthy

hello dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the deeper cause of
diabetes okay now in order to figure this out or figure out any problem now
we just have to understand what actually is the condition diabetes so this video
is about understanding what it really is a lot deeper typically when you think
about diabetes you always think about high blood sugar right a1c it's an
average of three months of high blood sugar you do a fasting blood sugar okay
that's how you diagnose diabetes go to the doctor
diabetes is high sugar right but let's go deeper what causes the high sugar
that's the question what controls the balance of sugar is insulin and insulin
has many functions but one main function is to act as a cellular key to allow
glucose to go into cell another function is to lower sugar so the obvious thing
is that diabetes really is an insulin deficiency okay that's really what's
causing it because if there wasn't enough insulin the sugar is going to go
high that's why it's high in the first place and when you have insulin
deficiency especially in a pre-diabetic state called insulin resistance or just
diabetes and type 2 in general you have a situation where your body makes more
insulin to compensate for the insulin deficiency okay so if you look at the
cell the cell absorbs insulin and it's supposed to then create a effect of
lowering the blood sugar so with insulin resistance the receptor starts blocking
right here then a signal is sent to the pancreas and of course it's going to
start making more and more insulin so we can drive that communication into the
cell but the first thing that happens is that insulin deficiency so diabetes is
an insulin deficiency okay so let's look at the big picture here we have a
situation we have insulin resistance okay really resistance means ignoring
now why would this little receptor ignore in front that's what I want to
talk about next and that's really the key to understanding the whole picture
insulin is a hormone hormones follow the law of communication so just like in
life why would you ignore someone typically because they're obsessively
communicating eager talk to someone who just will not shut up they keep talking
over and over and over I mean you'll be looking at something else over here and
they continue to communicate obsessively as you're paying attention to them so
obviously they're not in the present time right well the same thing happens
with the body there's obviously too much obsessive
communication too much obsessive insulin that's then causing the cell to ignore
that hormone okay that's really what diabetes is your
little cells are ignoring insulin so then the next question is what causes
obsessive insulin secretion that's where I have my favorite book Guyton
physiology and the reason I use physiology books because you it gives
it gives you the basic understanding that usually does not change over time it
usually stays consistent it's how the body works control of influence
secretion so we want to know what controls or what triggers insulin to go
up what raises insulin right first thing it says formerly it was believed that
insulin secretion is controlled almost entirely by blood glucose concentration
okay so we basically had this idea that arrays and insulin was only coming from
high glucose in the blood which is after a carbohydrate meal or too much sugar so
that's one cause right here because it right over here says insulin secretion
increases almost tenfold within three to five minutes after elevation of blood
glucose so you eat sugar eat refined carbs eat carbohydrates in general
you're going to spike insulin sometimes by 10 fold down here it says the
concentration of blood glucose rises above 100 milligrams per deciliter of
blood that's normal blood sugar that's like one teaspoon
of sugar in a gallon and a half of blood in your entire body of blood okay so one
teaspoon since right here as the concentrations of blood glucose rise
above that so that's like more than one teaspoon the rate of insulin secretion
rises rapidly reaching peaks some ten to thirty times the level of blood glucose
concentrations that's a tremendous amount of spike in your sugar okay so
number one what will cause an obsessive communication is glucose or sugar or
carbs mainly refined carbs okay that's level one number two second page other
factors that stimulate insulin secretion amino acids that's protein those are
here amino acid administration in the absence of a rise in blood glucose
caused only a small increase in insulin secretion basically telling us that
protein or amino acids can cause a small rise in in front okay not it's not
obviously as much as sugar but it's definitely a small rise then it goes on
to say however when administered at the same time a blood glucose concentration
is elevated the glucose induce secretion of insulin may be as much as doubled in
the presence of the excess amino acid what does that mean it means that if you
add sugar or glucose with the needle acids primarily excess of amino acids
okay maybe too much you're going to double the insulin and this is what I
have talked about in other videos you take a hotdog with the bun the ketchup
on the meat you add those two together fries a coke with your burger off like
the breaded meat all this sugar with the meat will double your insulin so you
don't want to do that that's the combination of those two things next
thing so we know sugar protein to some degree protein we sugar to a greater
degree the third thing gastrointestinal hormones
okay what is that well basically hormones that are triggered in your
digestive system when you eat okay says the gastrointestinal hormones
almost double the rate at insulin secretion following an average meal what
does that mean it means that eating in general triggers insulin okay so we got
sugar protein sugar with protein and eating triggers insulin other hormones
and the autonomic nervous system will also do it too that's another trigger
mainly cortisol now cortisol is the stress hormone so stress will also
increase insulin as well but nowhere on this page in this chapter in this book
does it say that saturated fats triggers insulin so saturated fats is not the
cause of diabetes or insulin resistance it's not in the physiology books okay so
really this is why when you go on a intermittent fasting ketogenic diet and
keep your carbs low below like between 20 and 50 grams when you don't have
excessive protein and you definitely don't combine protein with sugar you're
going to improve diabetes and insulin resistance okay that's really what's
causing it that makes sense so if we don't trigger insulin as much it can
heal and this resistance will go away and the body will start balancing out so
check out this great little demo on an actual person who applied this
information twenty I was kind of diagnosed with high cholesterol and got
high triglycerides and a lot of us hereditary my dad had it had all this as
well and that kind of started a chain of events for the next 20 years of me
fighting high cholesterol high triglycerides metabolic syndrome and
finally led to severe insulin resistance and the freaky dough I was on metformin
twice a day I was on I believe it was crustal and I was on a blood pressure
pill twice a day and now the only thing I take his official oil
magnesium I have my latest blood-borne I just had this done like like two weeks
ago if I can tell you the numbers real quick
my total cholesterol now is 241 my LVL is 151 my HDL is 70 and triglycerides or
55 triglycerides are one of the best indicators and you're totally fine
you're running on ketones big hand I had the particle test the particle
death done with this as well and the whole thing is in the large fluffy
category so it looks perfect that is so incredible one question on that your
father is he still around yeah I lost has the heart to be a lot of
years ago brain fed to grass-fed beef and butter pasture-raised eggs no
artificial sweeteners right now we use stevia for sweetener in our coffee so we
just made a huge change um since then so we're now July I am now I checked I
weigh myself every Sunday I'm 192 pounds um my last month my doctor advised me
that my diabetes has been reversed I have an a1c of 5.2 ugly or 5.4 one of
those two my triglycerides went from 1375 to a little over 100 that's normal
um everything just improved all my markers have improved cholesterol is
level it's normal I had dramatic change okay if you

hi guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about will doing a high fat ketogenic
diet clog your arteries now just from the pure observation of eating more fat and a
fatty clogged artery it sounds logical that if you were to eat more fat you're going to get
a clogged artery okay it sounds logical that you would eat more fat and then get more fat
in your body right but it's not how it works in the body because in the body there are various
hormones that tell certain types of calories what to convert into and the hormone that tells the
body whether to clog the artery or clean out the artery really is called insulin so insulin
is like the switch that converts that into the body of storage and also clogs arteries insulin
is a very inflammatory hormone if you have too much of it you can have a lot more inflammation
which can set you up for a whole series of events from the body start healing the inflammation or
the lesion in the arteries with a combination of cholesterol the band-aid calcium and fibrous
fibrin which is a kind of a connective tissue to form a little bit of a clot so really what
would started that would be the high levels of insulin not necessarily consuming cholesterol
now cholesterol is made by every almost every single cell in the body your body makes about
3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every single day the 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol is equal to
300 strips of bacon it's equal to about a pound of butter it's equal to 14 eggs so your body makes a
lot of cholesterol okay so when you consume more fat your body just makes more less yeah that's
how it works what really creates this clogged artery is high levels of insulin by consuming
too many couple right so if you were to cut your carbohydrates down like the breads pasta cereal
crackers things like that and sugar if you were to cut that down you would notice your cholesterol
would go way down also your triglycerides would go way down your back cholesterol will go down but if
you were to increase the sugar and the insulin and your cholesterol goes up and you should
even experiment with yourself to see if this is true for you but what I wanted to give you is I
have a little mini course that's very quick you could probably get it done in maybe 20 minutes
on ketosis to give you the basics I show you how it works what to eat the tweaks that I'm going to
recommend and the side effects it's a very short little mini course I put a link down below so if
you're not familiar with ketosis you can take the course it's free and get it done within 20 minutes
and really have a better understanding of it so check that out and thank you so much for watching

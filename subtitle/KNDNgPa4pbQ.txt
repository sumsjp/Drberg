now i've done several videos related to why someone might have a loss of smell the underlying
cause whether it's related to a virus or some other cause i have some new information i want
to share with you on restoring your sense of smell now in some recent research that
i've been looking at there's some interesting data on insulin insulin is needed to repair
the olfactory neurons okay now what you need to know is the olfactory neurons have everything to
do with your receptors for smell which if damaged can majorly affect your ability to taste by like
a factor of 80 percent so if you can't smell you're not going to be able to taste too well
and the interesting data about this which i'll put a link down below is this the highest density and
the highest concentration of insulin receptors in the brain are in the olfactory region of the
brain okay now this probably relates to the link between insulin and the storage of food like fat
and smell and taste related to appetite and so insulin has a huge role in the recovery of neurons
after an injury okay so it it has everything to do with regenerating the olfactory neurons and
so if there is not enough insulin available you're gonna have a hard time recovering from any type of
injury to these neurons and this is why a diabetic and a pre-diabetic are hit a lot harder with the
sense of smell after damaging those neurons than someone that doesn't have a problem with insulin i
mean if you even think about diabetics they also have a problem with losing their eyesight right
well they can also lose their sense of smell now you might be saying well i'm not a diabetic i'm
not pre-diabetic well chances are you may have insulin resistance which is a lot more common
in fact probably 70 of the population has insulin resistance which means you may have
the insulin deficiency on certain parts of your body as well as an insulin excess but as
far as the neurons in the olfactory area in your sinuses chances are you could be very deficient
in insulin if you have insulin resistance so then i started doing research on intra nasal
insulin spray okay i wanted to know if there's any relationship between spraying insulin into
the sinuses directly affecting the olfactory bulb which is in your sinuses and to see if there's any
improvement in smell and sure enough with just 40 units spraying up at your sinuses there was
an immediate improvement in the sense of smell and smell differentiation between different odors
there's many different things you can do with a loss of smell you can start taking zinc there
are certain types of essential oils that give off certain scents that you can retrain your
your olfactory neurons but restoring insulin resistance so you have enough insulin to help
repair these neurons i think is going to be probably the most important thing to do now
i've done a ton of videos and insulin resistance as you may know already if you're on my channel
but if you haven't watched my videos i think this is going to be very important for you to know
or if you just want to improve your sense of smell number one you have to go on a low carb diet
number two intermittent fasting is a must okay at least the fasting of 18 hours and if you're new
to my channel i put a link down below of how to do this correctly apple cider vinegar before bed
like two tablespoons and some water would be very very beneficial to help with insulin resistance
any type of exercise regular exercise is going to help you with insulin resistance vitamin d
at least 10,000 iu's per day can help you with insulin resistance enough potassium either in
a supplement or potassium foods is going to be very important in restoring insulin resistance
and enough vitamin b1 can also help and so the more you improve insulin resistance
the more you're going to have normal insulin the more you're going to have the ability to restore
these neurons if they're damaged all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

whoo okay what do we got Karen well we have another snack today and it's
zucchini it's a zucchini roll you know anything
about zucchini well the problem is zucchini is so bland you got to spice it up
so I think you did that with this yes and this is a zucchini roll with herb
goat cheese and capers and it's lovely and if you see on this plate here I made
little tiny ones just for nibbling you can stick a little toothpick through it
serve it but you'll also see larger ones and and what's really cool about this is
you can make them as large as you want and something larger like that would be
a beautiful side to some fish or something like a whole meal on your
plate so it can be a side dish or a snack very flavorful yeah

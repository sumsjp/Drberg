so today we're going to talk about a potato chip versus a corn
chip and i want you to put down below in the comment section
which one do you like more do you like potato chips more
or corn chips now in college i'm going to admit
i had my share of corn chips and potato chips
i wouldn't just buy a little bag i would buy the big jumbo bags and down
the entire doritos in one sitting and i didn't just get the plane
i got the one with all the different flavors and
all the added extra benefit of the msg that's why i'm doing these videos
because it caught up with me but let's do our comparison
and everything's based on one ounce so potato versus corn
corn is gmo most of the time potato usually is not gmo okay the
calories 160 versus 140.
total fat 10 grams versus 7 grams so
some people stop right there and say oh my gosh the potato chip has more fat i'm
going to avoid that i think i'll go with the corn chip based
on the fat that's not what you want to look at let's go to sodium 170 versus
115 milligrams right there people will tend
to go with this because they think that wow this is so much healthier let's keep
going potassium look at this in one ounce of
potato chips you have 350 milligrams of potassium
that's a lot now in one banana it's about 300 milligrams of potassium
but i wouldn't eat potato chips to get your potassium
okay corn chips zero potassium carbs and this is probably the most
important thing right here we got 15 grams of carbs
per 1 ounce versus 19 grams of carbs now if we take out our fiber 1 gram and
1 gram we get our net carbs 14 versus 18.
so corn has an extra 4 grams of carbohydrates
despite having less calories and less fat
so we have less fat more carb more fat less carbs so so far
potato chip is the winner okay so sugar less than one gram less than
one gram here's the problem the vegetable oils
they'll usually list several oils but you don't really know which one they're
using corn sunflower canola and sometimes safflower
and sometimes they use cottonseed oil now this is gmo this is definitely gmo
you don't even know if they're actually ever using this but they put that in
there okay with corn same deal corn oil
and of course that's a seed oil but of course they don't call it that they call
it a vegetable oil it sounds better canola that's gmo we don't know about
sunflower oil now here's the problem GMO GMO GMO GMO
GMO which means that there could be traces of glyphosate which is a
herbicide not to mention the processing of these
oils using hexane which is a solvent and anytime
you cook a carbohydrate with a fat
like this oil right here which will lead to all sorts of toxic compounds which
i'm going to put a link down below if you want to know more about that
if we were to compare these this is the winner right here
but of course if you're on keto and you're doing it in
fasting you want to avoid both of these well thanks for watching and i will see

hey guys i wanted to do a quick video on
my electrolyte powder
uh in relationship to exercise because i
had someone recently
that brought up an interesting point
that i wanted to do just an entire video
on okay and she
she wanted to know um should i take this
when i exercise because i'm going to
sweat
and lose my electrolytes so let's just
talk about
that one point first of all what is an
electrolyte
electrolyte is a electrically charged
mineral that helps
several things number one it helps the
pacemaker of the heart
so it helps the rhythm of the heart
conduct electricity
and contract and relax it helps muscles
in general contract and relax
it helps the transmission of nerve and
with
with the heart you have both muscle and
nerve working together
electrolytes are also involved in
hydration
and fluid volume okay inside and outside
the cell but here's the thing when you
exercise
and you sweat you primarily lose
salt or sodium chloride okay you don't
lose a lot of potassium magnesium
or calcium so this is not
a sodium replacement okay so you may
even need if you exercise a lot and you
sweat a lot you might need to add some
more sea salt
but the reason i created this is because
i wanted to match
what an average person is missing in
their bodies most people are lacking
potassium magnesium okay especially
potassium
because we need so much of it we need
like 4 700 milligrams
so i wanted something that would fulfill
a deficiency or a gap in someone's
nutrition
so a high carb diet would definitely
deplete not only magnesium
but definitely potassium as well also
people don't consume
enough food high in potassium magnesium
which happen to be the vegetable family
but i know that's not you it's probably
your relative or a family member right
and then you have processed foods which
are really really high in sodium
very low in potassium magnesium and not
to mention
monosodium glutamate which is
pretty much in every fast food
restaurant and a lot of the other
restaurants as well
but it's hidden as modified food starch
okay it's the same thing
but here's the big point i want to bring
up not only does your body
need a lot of potassium and magnesium
electrolytes
it also needs other forms of these
minerals
to help enzymes in your body
specifically to make energy
in them like in the mitochondria
potassium
and magnesium are like the spark plugs
in these certain enzymes that help
you generate energy so if you're low in
potassium or magnesium
and you exercise you're not going to
have the endurance and this is why when
people take this they get a lot of
energy and they have an endurance
because they're usually missing these
minerals and there's just one more point
i want to bring up about a comparison of
other electrolyte powders out there
they're usually high in sugar they have
high amounts of sodium
which will replace the sweat but very
low
potassium hardly any magnesium and
they're loaded with sugar
maltodextrin or even dextrin which is
synthetic sugar
so in summary i just want to bring up
this really important point that yes
you're going to sweat with exercise and
you do need salt
okay but you also need these other
electrolytes as well

so let's say for example you have acne and you've tried everything you did the healthy version of
the ketogenic diet you're doing fasting right now but still it's not clearing up this acne
and if you haven't tried those two things that would probably work about 90% of the time and i
put a link down below of exactly what to do but i want to give you a little understanding of
what's behind acne and it has to do with two main hormones primarily a spike in androgens
or a spike in estrogen or a combination of both so let's go through this one by one stress
induces a spike of cortisol and cortisol can increase androgens and so stress is one factor and
so if it is stress you probably are going to know it and you're just going to have to do something
about the stress there are a lot of things you can take there's a lot of things you can
do to reduce stress okay so the next thing is that your testosterone in your body is being converted
into a more powerful form of estrogen called dht and that can definitely trigger acne there's
a certain enzyme that causes this conversion and low progesterone can allow this conversion to take
place but normal or higher levels of progesterone can inhibit that enzyme and this is why
certain people when they take progesterone get rid of their acne now what causes estrogen to
be lowered in the body usually it's an increase in testosterone now i'm going to come back to
estrogen in a minute but first let's talk about how to inhibit this enzyme that's making this
conversion you can take saul palmetto which has been known to help acne you can also take stinging
nettle root which is a good remedy or black cohosh all right now let's switch gears to estrogen
and we're talking about estrogen dominance this is where you would see cystic acne but it could
be other types of acne as well now we just got done talking about the enzyme that allows the
conversion of testosterone to dht now let's talk about another enzyme that converts testosterone to
estrogen it's called aromatase so there are various natural remedies to take to lower
that enzyme stinging nettle root is a good one and the reason i like that one is because it can also
reduce the other enzyme that's causing that conversion to that powerful form of testosterone
dht so you can kill two birds with one stone and as a side note stinging nettle root is a
very powerful anti-inflammatory so if you have back pain it's something that's really powerful
the second inhibitor of this enzyme is cruciferous vegetables okay so start consuming more of those
and there's also something called dim which is a concentrated
phytonutrient in the cruciferous vegetables that you can also take
to act as a powerful inhibitor of aromatase so that's really good for cystic acne as well
so one of the ways that you would know you would have this problem is you have heavy periods you
have a problem with your menstrual cycle and then you just need to consume more cruciferous
vegetables and definitely stinging nettle root and some dim would be very powerful as well
all right there's another situation regarding estrogen dominance and that has to do with
your liver your liver is naturally regulating excessive amounts of hormones especially estrogen
and there are certain things in there that are creating a buffer and the most powerful remedy for
the liver to handle this situation would be milk thistle not only will that help normalize estrogen
but it will also increase the production of bile now if you actually even look up
milk thistle in relationship to lowering pms symptoms you'll find a lot of great information so
if you are aware that you have liver problems or maybe a fatty liver or you have hepatitis or
you have a gut i think milk thistle will be a really good remedy to take not to mention getting
on keto and especially in a minute fasting next situation is let's say you have pcos
polycystic ovarian syndrome now this is a situation where you have too many androgens
but that's being caused by high levels of insulin you're eating too many carbohydrates
high levels of insulin increase androgens and that can definitely cause not just acne
but hair loss a deeper voice and many other symptoms last point is dairy
dairy can give you a lot of estrogen so i would avoid dairy if you have acne that alone might
just clear the whole thing up so number one avoid all dairy especially milk and cheese number two
avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates and the carbohydrates you can have which you'll be excited
about are cruciferous vegetables and a lot of them okay that will help you all right number four
take certain herbs based on your situation so i've already talked about that and you're going
to have to differentiate maybe which which set of herbs you may need right number five zinc if
you're deficient in zinc which by the way is very very common let alone can cause you to have acne
cod liver oil is another really good remedy not only because it's loaded with omega-3 fatty acids
which will greatly help the texture of your skin help regulate if your skin is too oily or too dry
especially but it also has vitamin a and vitamin d vitamin d will help regulate insulin and vitamin
a has been known to actually help acne in a big way so calibrate oil is a very powerful remedy and
lastly you want to avoid fluoride and i'm talking about the fluoride treatments you would get
from your dentist there's a really good one and fairly inexpensive one that you can actually just
keep in your fridge it's like a little container i'll put a link down below and also in your shower
here's the problem tap water is loaded with fluoride and if it's either exposed to your
skin or you're drinking it it can really mess up your skin there you have it thanks for watching

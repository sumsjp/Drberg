all right this is a very interesting video um i'm always searching around for um
the latest greatest diet advice and i actually found the worst device in the entire world
it's actually a series of bad advice all on one website on one page by someone who is ranking
very high in google i won't mention their name but let's just go through this number one eating
frequently prevents over eating right makes sense totally logical very unworkable because
if you're consuming carbs frequently not only is that going to make you crave carbs more but the
eating frequently stimulates hunger so if you want to stimulate hunger and be hungry all the time
just consume small carbohydrate meals and you are going to be hungry all day long all right number
two plan ahead don't skip meals or allow yourself to get hungry so if you just eat before you get
hungry you won't overeat so that way you won't gain weight because you're eating less calories
so this is just more of the same low calorie advice which we have already proven that it
doesn't work a million times all right here's the next one eating every two to three hours
maintains metabolism really the body will feel reassured and loved with regular intake
of calories you will see no reason to store body fat so this one right here is just sums it right
up this is like the exact opposite of what you want people to do can you imagine eating every
two hours i mean what's going to happen to your metabolism so we just keep feeding our body 24 7.
forget the two hours let's just feed it constantly and then finally it will feel reassured and loved
with these constant intake of calories i mean it's not going to really see any need for storing fat
because it's constantly getting calories this makes absolutely no sense all right number
four eating foods that are low energy density type foods like fruit vegetables whole grains
and lean proteins so you will feel full longer well first of all it's very difficult to feel
satisfied if you don't have fat now what's really interesting about this one is that why would you
need to feel full longer if you're eating every two to three hours isn't that enough food in your
body to actually be satisfied well what they don't realize is when you go low-fat like that
and you're doing the carbohydrates the grains the fruits things like that oh my gosh i mean it's
going to be torture on your body you're going to be constantly hungry all the time and you're gonna
get your body trained to be eating every couple hours and there's absolutely no adaptation to fat
so forget about losing fat all right number five we're back to the calorie thing
complete waste of time what are you going to do track your calories and
say well portion control i'm just going to have this many calories
because i'm eating every two hours i have to make sure these meals are nice and small right
it's just it's completely trivial and a waste of time all right number six join a community
oh that makes sense so the blind can lead the blind so we can all do the wrong thing together
we can all fail together as a group yeah that makes a lot of sense all right and number seven
you'll have smarter thinking because your brain gets the regular flow of sugar
yeah well that's going to lead to what's called type 3 diabetes dementia probably alzheimer's

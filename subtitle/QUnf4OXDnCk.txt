so you can get your vitamin d from food right now you can it's almost impossible unless you
consume fatty fish every single day of the week vitamin d is called the sunshine vitamin because
you're supposed to get it from the sun but it's a bit difficult take a look at this if you're out
in the sun for 10 minutes you're gonna get about a thousand international units of vitamin d
okay just a thousand that's not that much but that's only if you live close to the equator
and if you're young and not overweight and don't have diabetes and it's summer day it's the mid
part of the day and you're lying down not standing up because the sun can't really go through your
head right it's just a little is going to go on your face but not the rest of the body
if you're not using sunscreen if you have a healthy liver if there's no clouds out if
there's no pollution that's blocking the sun rays if there's no genetic defects if there's
no gastrointestinal damage because inflammation in scar tissue blocks the vitamin d absorption also
if there's no gallbladder removal because you need bile salts to help you absorb vitamin d so the
point i'm trying to make is the reason why people are deficient is because they're not getting it
from their diet and they're not getting it from the sun because of these factors right here

let's discuss the best way
to balance your hormones now this method
is
pretty expensive i don't know if you're
gonna be able to afford it
it's actually
free okay because you are fasting and
you're actually saving money while
you're doing this
but believe it or not fasting is
probably one of the best things you can
do for your endocrine system all the
different hormones as well as a lot of
other systems including your autonomic
nervous system which i will cover in
another video
now when they did the research with
fasting
sometimes they used
alternative day fasting where you're
pretty much eating what you want one day
and then you're not eating anything the
next day right i don't like that at all
because you never really get into any
type of adaptation so it's probably
pretty painful and hard to do because
you never get rid of your appetite
and then you have the five and two which
i also don't like where five days a week
you're eating what you want and then
two days of the week probably on a
saturday and sunday you're doing 500
calories again you're not going to be
able to adapt into fat burning too well
and you're probably going to suffer
through those two days okay then you
have time restricted eating
which is intermittent fasting where you
have
a certain window where you eat and then
you don't eat for another window so it
could be for example
18 hours of fasting
and six hour eating window or maybe 20
hours of fasting in a four hour eating
window so i'm going to cover all the
main hormones but
this right here this hormone right here
this is where you're going to see most
the benefits okay insulin insulin
reduction
insulin sensitivity
all that is improved when you do fasting
and if we look at the magnitude or the
influence of reducing insulin
on your entire body
as far as health goes i mean it's just
off the charts as far as
benefits you decrease inflammation well
guess what that's going to do to your
thyroid which by the way
90 of all
thyroid problems when we're dealing with
autoimmune
is hashimoto's and you're going to have
a lot of inflammation so just by
reducing inflammation you automatically
improve
the thyroid gland okay diabetes this is
involving a gland called the pancreas
right it's part of the endocrine system
and then you have insulin resistance
which is behind so many problems
including developing a fatty liver and
gaining weight and metabolic syndrome
which includes high cholesterol and high
blood pressure and like i said before
the autonomic nervous system see when
you have high insulin and high glucose
your autonomic nervous system which
involves the flight or fight mechanism
the digestive system
the cardiovascular system all of that is
improved greatly when you normalize
insulin one side effect from a diabetic
is autonomic nervous system dysfunction
especially in the digestive system and
in many other systems since the
autonomic nervous system crosses over
into a lot of different body systems
okay let's where do we start well let's
start with leptin leptin
decreases when you're fasting and leptin
has everything to do with your appetite
so your appetite is going to go down
it's going to make it really easy to
fast when you have no appetite
you hear rumors that
fasting will
negatively affect the thyroid really
well
how do you diagnose a hypothyroid
condition or even a hyperthyroid
condition
by thyroid stimulating hormone which is
a pituitary hormone okay
you don't diagnose it with t4 you
diagnose it with this pituitary hormone
and by the way
when you do fasting there is no change
with the thyroid stimulating hormone
there is a decrease in t3 which is the
active form
of thyroid hormone but that is occurring
because you're either losing weight or
your ability to burn fat is increasing
decreasing the need for energy see
before you did fasting the metabolism
seemed to be slow because you're only
burning glucose you're not tapping into
your fat reserves so your whole energy
system is off it requires a lot more t3
to run this body machine
well now it doesn't so it goes down it's
just adapting so the thyroid
does not
suffer when you do
healthy fasting and i'm talking about
fasting with
nutrients because of all the
complications that occur when someone
fasts it mainly has to do with the
electrolyte losses okay and compounded
by
b vitamin deficiencies
so as long as you have the sea salt
electrolytes and b vitamins
you're going to definitely avoid a lot
of
issues all right the next one i'm going
to talk about is androgens for females
but guess what if you're a female you
don't want a lot of androgens because
that's a condition called pcos you have
too many androgens so you get facial
hair you get alopecia you lose your hair
you start having a deeper voice you
start gaining weight so that condition
actually is improved with fasting in
fact what's really behind this spike in
androgens
is insulin so when you do fasting you
lower insulin and you normalize
androgens and things start coming back
in the balance with females when you do
fasting there hasn't been any major
change with follicle stimulating hormone
or luteinizing hormone the two hormones
that
come from the pituitary that come down
to the ovary those two hormones are not
affected by fasting and then we have
estrogen there's doesn't seem to be a
lot of change with estrogen when you're
doing
fasting now what about in some of the
mice studies okay they have they show
infertility well there's really a lack
of evidence of infertility
there has been a loss of the menstrual
cycle for a period of time
but what's interesting about these
rodent studies is that
the total menstrual cycles
of the lifespan of a rat don't seem to
decrease it's only when they're doing
fasting so apparently that menstrual
cycle just continues a little bit longer
in their life there hasn't been any
evidence to show that fasting
causes infertility in human bodies all
right now what about testosterone in men
some studies show that it does decrease
but with no loss in strength but in
other studies it does show that it will
increase luteinizing hormone by
67 percent
and
increase testosterone by a hundred and
eighty percent from my knowledge working
with
tens of thousands or even hundreds of
thousands of people
worldwide i have not seen a negative
problem with testosterone
in men at all when they're doing fasting
let's now get into cortisol okay here's
another misconception um you'll see
little articles that we'll talk about
the negative aspects of
fasting because it's going to increase
your cortisol and you're going to be
stressed out the first thing you need to
know is that if cortisol does increase
you're not going to then be stressed out
because cortisol is a hormone that
responds to stress it doesn't cause
stress it just causes the body to adapt
to stress states and cortisol is a
counter regulatory hormone so in other
words when you stop eating sugar and
your blood sugar goes down cortisol is
mobilized to increase your sugar to a
certain
level but if you're increasing your
cortisol temporarily from fasting okay
and not chronic stress what is
interesting is that there's two
different receptors
for cortisol okay
one receptor that's involved with stress
and another receptor involved with other
things that might trigger cortisol and
so apparently when you're doing fasting
and you have an increase of cortisol
the effects are not bad the effects are
not the same as
a stress response and that has
everything to do with what that cortisol
does with the receptor and the different
effects that that receptor will then
create but if you want more information
on that topic there is a real
interesting
dialogue by dr uh mark madison okay and
i put that link down below where he
talked about that he's a
researcher in this area in the topic of
fasting
now what about growth hormone well guess
what growth hormone will increase and
that's a good thing because growth
hormone is all about
repair it's about
muscle it's about increasing your
endurance
it's about healing it's an anti-aging
hormone and it's also a fat burning
hormone it's going to help mobilize
fat as fuel
what about prolactin okay well there's
apparently no change with prolactin and
the two other things i want to mention
in this video
is number one fasting greatly improves
your circadian rhythms it improves
certain timing flows in your body and
with that comes along a lot of different
hormone flows that are set up on a
timing mechanism so just by the fact of
improving your circadian rhythms you're
going to improve your hormones overall
or at least balance these hormones that
have been out of balance probably
because
of this too much insulin
last point i want to bring up is your
gut microbiome greatly improves when you
do fasting and from that comes a lot of
improvements with your hormones as well
which i will have to do another video on
that now i think the next most
appropriate video to show you is the one
on fasting how to do it correctly check
it out i put it right here

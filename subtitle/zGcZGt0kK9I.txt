okay so I wanted to create a video just explain that weight loss in general is
not a natural thing for your body it goes against its main purpose the body's
purpose of surviving so surviving is not losing anything so weight loss is not
natural and that's why when people say you know all I have to do is balance
your meals everything in moderation very bad advice because they don't
differentiate between the hormones and the nutrients they don't look at those
factors each type of calorie influences hormones differently proteins do
stimulate the fat burning hormone but not if you have too much if you add
sugar to proteins like let's say I have a burger and fries or burger and a bun
or a burger and a milkshake what you're doing is you're quadrupling the amount
of insulin that's being pumped out insulin is the hormone that blocks all
the building of burn fat so we want to keep insulin low we want to keep the
sugar down protein moderate but you can do frequent meals and then also MSG
monosodium glutamate that actually triggers insulin by 300%
so that's a lot of hidden chemical in a lot of different fast food places and it
makes the food just tastes better but really it's a spike in your insulin of
course stress we want to keep the stress low but you really have to treat each
type of calorie differently you want to leverage your hormones and not
necessarily have a balanced diet so when I talk about get healthy to lose weight
not lose weight to get healthy I'm talking about the health of the
endocrine system you might need to and when I talk about health I'm not talking
about balancing your diet a balanced diet is not a healthy diet the key is at
the end of the day you end up with the amount of nutrients that you need so I'm
just going to give you one little tiny example we're going to take vitamin A so
we need about 300 to 4 hundred micrograms of vitamin A every
day now typically you've probably been taught that eating carrots yams spinach
kale is very very high in vitamin A and it is but the vitamin A is it's called a
pro vitamin A it's not the real thing it's not the active form it's kind of
like a pre vitamin A and your body only converts a little bit of it so really
all the active forms of vitamin A are in animal products
okay so what's wait a minute good form oh my gosh well if you're vitamin-A
deficient you're going to get acne you are going to have rough skin in those
little bumps that looks like chicken little bumps like this rough excess scaly
skin you get psoriasis scaly skin dry skin look at all these women that are by
the the makeup creams what are they put in that makeup cream retinol vitamin A
different forms of vitamin A what accutane that's a very high concentrated
vitamin A it has a lot of side effects to the liver because too high but the
point is that vitamin A deficiency can create a lot of problems with skin not
to mention blindness at night can't see in the dark because you need vitamin A
for the eye so where do you get vitamin A mainly from egg yolks which is a
healthy fat you get it from butter but the problem is sometimes when you're
trying to leverage and lose weight you want to keep your fats a little bit
lower if your metabolism is lower so how are you going to do all this butter and
egg yolks you know well you can have a small amount of egg yolk and look for
foods that have the new have the higher concentration of vitamin A and that
would be fish oils specifically cod liver oil cod liver oil because remember
it's in the liver right cod liver oil and liver itself if you want to eat some
of it I can't eat that cod liver oil is just loaded with vitamin A makes your
skin really really nice so the point I'm trying to make is that
we're trying to be have a healthy diet not necessarily a balanced diet we're
being smart with our calories and our nutrients we want high density nutrient
foods we don't necessarily just want to eat constant butter because that might
not be the concentrated version we need because we're trying to lose weight as
well so the point I'm trying to differentiate is that healthy diet
doesn't equal balanced diet but what I'm talking about is you can have a healthy
diet with nutrient rich and leverage your hormones but you have to have all
these factors in the eating plan and that's exactly what we've created as we
put together an eating plan that has the nutrition and it leverages the hormone
so it's very very intelligent and smart and strategic to help you maximize
weight loss and not have your hair fall out all right so I hope that helped see
in the next video

so i want to talk about the symptom of having a lump in your throat a sensation that there's
something in there but there's actually nothing in there what is this condition what can you do
about it there's a few different medical names for this condition if you wanted to know this
it's not important but what i'm going to give you today is some basic data on really what's
happening if we take a look at these structures right through here we have the pharynx which is
in the back of the throat right here and let's say i'm looking this way right here so the tongue
is right here the jaw is right here and then we go from the pharynx right below it we have the larynx
that's your voice box okay we have the vocal cords you have a lot of other stuff going on there
you have muscles and ligaments and cartilage right through here right below this you have the trachea
the trachea is a structure that has an opening into your lungs okay so that's where the trachea
is and then right behind the trachea you have the esophagus that's where the food goes down into the
stomach and you have various valves and controls or sphincters sphincter is a muscular valve that
can close like this and that's controlled by certain parts of your autonomic nervous system
and there's a little flap through this structure to control the food to make sure the food doesn't
go down the wrong pipe and that's called the epiglottis and so you have a lot going on
in this area right here with nerves and muscles and tendons and cartilage and the coordination of
allowing air and food and speaking now about a couple years ago i was
doing lunch with an old client that i had and as i was sitting there i noticed that she started
choking after she consumed some soup with some chunks of chicken and it got stuck in her throat
and she's like i can't breathe right and i've never ever been in a situation where
i had to perform the heimlich maneuver and i'm very quickly trying to remember how to do it
and so i go behind her and i start to do the procedure and it doesn't work and she's like he's
choking and i'm looking around and everyone's just watching and i'm going oh my gosh she's turning
red she's going to pass out and at that moment what came to mind is that this area of your body
the vocal cords the structures in this area are highly innervated by the autonomic nervous system
both the parasympathetic which is the vagus nerve as well as the sympathetic fibers and so
what i told her is i just said relax just calm down just try to relax now i know it's kind of
difficult to try to get someone to calm down when they can't breathe but she just sat down she
relaxed and then she could start breathing and so one of the reasons i brought that up is that one
of the triggers for having this lump in the throat sensation is stress so when you go through stress
you activate these fingers and things can close up and you can have all sorts of problems including
laryngitis and all sorts of hoarseness and problems with your vocal cords as well
so this symptom can be activated by stress a virus low vitamin d levels which we'll come back to that
gerd which is an acid reflux situation and even a problem with the vagus nerve one of the things
that's happening is we're getting a spasm in some of the soft tissue in this area right here
and one of the medical names for a spasm in this area is laryngeal spasm and what's interesting
is if you look up this condition right here hypocalcemia that is low amounts of calcium
in your blood one of the symptoms for this is this right here spasm in your larynx interesting
that's one of the symptoms so in practice what i would always give people is some simple
calcium and it really would help them the type of calcium that i would recommend for this condition
is calcium lactate i used to use calcium lactate from standard process and you can
get that online it's very inexpensive it works great and it's non-dairy i would also believe
calcium orotate would work too i haven't tried it i do know that this works good for other types of
spasms in the body as well as menstrual cramps and it's a type of calcium that can penetrate
the tissues very well but in practice i always use calcium lactate it's a non-dairy very inexpensive
you would take two or three an empty stomach each day and that seems to work very very well
because what we're dealing with is a spasm a muscular contraction another symptom of
hypocalcemia is tetany which is a little twitching right here and you could actually have tetany
and that can actually affect the um quality of a voice there's actually a condition called stridor
in infants where an infant's voice is very harsh and raspy and take a while guess what causes that
hypocalcemia and low vitamin d levels because one of the causes of hypocalcemia is low amounts of
vitamin d so it could be that the person is low in calcium because they're low in vitamin d which
probably is actually pretty common so one of the things i would recommend to take on empty stomach
is not just the calcium but the vitamin d as well we also know that if someone has gerd even though
they have a acid reflux what's really behind that is a low amount of acid in their stomach
it's called hypochlorhydria or a chlorhydria which means you have a deficiency of acid or
you have no acid and what's happening now is the valves aren't closing and the acid is squirting up
well if you don't have enough acid guess what you're not going to be able to absorb in the body
calcium there's a connection between low vitamin d and low calcium there's also connection between
viruses certain viruses and calcium too because calcium can help put certain viruses back in
remission and too much stress over a period of time can deplete your calcium as well so anyway
if you have a lump in the throat try this remedy and comment down below before you go if you have a

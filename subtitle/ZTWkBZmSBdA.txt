hey guys today we're going to talk about
five very cool sleep tricks
you probably never heard of before okay
that'll help you get into a nice restful
sleep so you're sleeping like a baby of
course babies are up on like crying i'm
just kidding
but this will help okay so number one
you want to turn down the temperature
okay
i find this really is effective uh if
you're sleeping at a temperature of like
68
degrees
people get in a much deeper sleep and
they sleep longer than having it too hot
in the room real simple thing but it
does help okay number two acupressure
now there's a couple different things
that i'm going to recommend you can use
a tool like this or even your hands and
the first thing is that doing
acupressure on parts of your body that
are stressed out if you think about it
what keeps your body awake
well there's something in your body that
won't turn off and there's tension or
stress in certain parts of your body
mainly it's going to be in your back
in your abdomen or even your chest okay
so there's certain acupressure
techniques and stretches that you can do
to extract this stress from your body so
you can turn off at night much better
the first one is in your mid-back you
can use a small towel and roll it up or
a foam roller and you can arch back on a
chair
all the way through your mid-back
this is the location of something called
the sympathetic nervous system the
flight or fight mechanism and this is
going to quickly relax the entire
part of your upper torso especially in
the chest area so you have to try this
and then go to sleep you're going to
find that it will help you go to sleep
the next technique is working on the
acupressure points around your abdomen
okay and i'm going to put a link down
below of how to do this but you're
basically
extracting stress
from different digestive organs down
there different acupressure points that
are linked with different organs because
if an organ is congested or overworking
it can create tension in that area and
by doing these acupressure points every
single night before you go to bed and i
do them you're going to find you're
going to sleep a whole heck of a lot
better all right so the next thing is
right before you go to bed you just
basically take every single problem that
you're dealing with every single
thing you're in doubt with or indecisive
about and just list all these items okay
get them out of your head so you're not
trying to solve them
that really helps and i do this all the
time okay so in the morning i have a
list of problems to attack okay number
four
no lights so many people when they go to
bed they're around bright lights and
they try to go to sleep about an hour
before you go into bed you want to turn
the lights down you don't want to have
your eyes exposed to bright lights just
soft lights
because darkness stimulates melatonin
which then triggers serotonin to help
you sleep so we want to keep the lights
off about an hour before going to sleep
okay number five salary
so simple very effective now if you're
fasting is celery going to knock you out
of ketosis
not very much it's mainly off fiber
with just a little bit of carbohydrate
so i wouldn't worry about it but if you
are concerned about it just consume the
celery right after your last meal
but i have found that if you consume
celery in the evening it does help your
sleep a lot because there's a certain
chemical in celery that decreases blood
pressure and it relaxes the nervous
system so try it out and see if it can
work for you thanks for watching

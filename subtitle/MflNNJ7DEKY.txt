hey guys I have a really great story from one of my favorite clients
she's been we've been working together for how many years probably
since 2006 yeah so it's been a while so you worked at the Pentagon for 30 years
you did a lot of their third shift or second shift all the different shifts
rotation so that powers eight hours all that stuff yeah so that just burnt her
out and then she basically retired okay she came here and you had got diabetes
right right had diabetes for just about my entire adult life now you also had
you you were how much did you weigh at that time I weighed 148 pounds
Wow and do you have any sleeping problems did you have any heart problems
what kind of other symptoms did you have I've had a irregular heartbeat that
you've helped me treat and everything and that's gone fine now and my weight
problems and sleep problems I did I was because of the working shift worked for
so many years I really really had terrible sleep problems so so we've been
working with her she she is very organized I mean she look at her history
of exactly cheats checking the blood sugars so um it's really helpful to see
the trends she knows what works what doesn't she helped me with cookbook and
so there's a lot of things that we kind of learn from from you like like you
found that some of the medications really had some serious side effects I
think it was lipitor right yes that was a terrible drug like if this was your
hand yes nerves made my hand go numb it just made nauseous diarrhea just all
kinds of horrible things lethargy making you know want to get out of bed in the
morning it was terrible stuff and then your husband right before I came to you
we were both on it so your husband also had some health issues as well I think
he had some issues with his cholesterol some weight right yes okay yes and so we
worked with him I remember he had kind of a
a pizza crust he was concerned about that and it's all gone it took a bit you
know it took some time but thank goodness that she controls the eating
and she so the other thing that I was going to tell talk about is that what do
you find happens with your blood sugar just let's say your diet is good but
your stress is high what happens you're better
your blood sugar will go up you have to really be careful what you eat but even
if you're doing that if you're not sleeping you can still I mean my blood
Sugar's stable 109 or below usually and I'm having the 90s usually but with
stressful situations they'll can go up into the one teens and if you get
something slipped into you on your dinner or something I've had a 124
just lately which I'm almost never out of the one teens so so what's your a1c
now a1c is 6.4 Wow and what was it it was six point eight because my doctor
put me on januvia to make it go down and made it go up instead so I've been
fighting it back down with your help for quite a while now so yeah I got the one
in this 6.4 Wow and then the other thing with your blood sugars I think they can
go down to like right around 100 105 98 97 so they're hovering real nicely in
that area but I just wanted to explain the relationship between stress stress
activates cortisol cortisol releases sugar and it goes up so I mean no one
talks about that but the whole stress component there's like just focusing on
the food but right now probably 98% of her diet is really clean and health
benefits are off the charts you had some we dealt with that heart issue it was
but now it's just nice and calm her graph we remember when we checked your
graph it was always way off and now it's like way to the right you have recovery
sleeps better but there's been a lot of improvements and it was almost like you
can you can see what foods affect blood sugars I is there anything that
you know that's not necessarily sugar that will spike the sugar like like
maybe any kind of junk food or msg have you noticed that
carbs just you know things that you shouldn't be eating is like we eat our
veggies we eat dinner salad what I use the cookbook every day okay and we just
have a different salad we can have anything that we've ever had as a
sandwich as a salad instead and we love it and we don't miss bread at all
anymore you know it's just they love it awesome and then what's your weight now
is 147 what is it now I'm 117 so you you don't have a weight problem anymore and
so do you do you have more energy to do you feel more vital yes yeah and we did
your you know we do your interval training can do the run walk kind of a
thing and just rest and it's so important to do that and I couldn't I
came here I had a plantar fasciitis problems that I couldn't hardly walk and
now I can run and it's just it's fantastic and just keeping I can tell if
we go somewhere and you get slipped something that's got carbs in it I can
feel it in my feet you know with the swelling or whatever and feeling a
discomfort like tingly and when I don't do that
I don't have that problem at all that's awesome she's like the perfect compliant
I mean compliance is perfect for example tell her what exercise she'll do it what
to eat she'll do it so it's so nice you don't have to fight she was like very
willing to get better so the other thing is she's also using the acupressure tool
this thing right here and she's got really good at using this thing I mean
you do your back probably almost every night and she calls it the balloon
doggie so it just look like a balloon doggie up the front the front and up the
back and and you know behind the neck there is oh
my god just puts you right out so well I appreciate you really kind of being
compliant and one last thing it's kind of funny because she goes to her medical
doctor and we I talked about some of the videos you just would think that they
would say wow you're doing so much better
what are you doing I want to spread the word right it's not mutant
yeah there's like they think we're mutant right this is just as a fluke of
nature or whatever that this stuff is working yeah they just can't think with
it so their whole thing is like well I'm glad that you're cutting your fats out
I'm glad you're doing your whole bread
no yeah yeah just like no fat we use Mayo to make the salad dressings I make
my own olive oil dressing I mean the good fats in our diet and cholesterol is
in the perfect range and he thinks that's a complete fluke well thank you
very much welcome thank you you're welcome I appreciate it
sure

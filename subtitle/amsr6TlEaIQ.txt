did you realize that testosterone replacement therapy can potentially increase your estrogen
i mean that sounds crazy here you are trying to increase your testosterone and it backfires and
you end up with too much of the opposing hormone estrogen here's what you need to know the majority
of estrogen in men comes from their own estrogen extra testosterone acts as a precursor for more
estradiol especially if you are overweight so your fat cells make an enzyme called aromatase
aromatase causes testosterone to be converted to estrogen so this is one of the side effects
of testosterone replacement therapy you get excessive breast tissue and there's quite a
few other symptoms involving excess amounts of estrogen and so the symptoms of low testosterone
thinning hair decrease actual body hair starting with loss of hair on the lower legs
erectile dysfunction decreased libido decreased muscle mass
having blood sugar issues these are all symptoms of low t but the question is what is underneath
this whole thing so you're trying to increase it but what's really causing low testosterone
well one big cause would be a deficiency in zinc zinc is one of the best trace minerals to increase
testosterone if you're zinc deficient you can even develop a condition called
hypogonadism where your gonads actually shrink and it's very easy nowadays to be deficient in zinc
i'm going to put some videos down below if you're new to my channel because
it's very important to understand why you might be deficient in zinc if that's the cause fenugreek
is another natural herb that can help increase testosterone tribulus is another one as well but
in summary when we're dealing with low levels of testosterone zinc is a really good natural remedy
that can help you thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product

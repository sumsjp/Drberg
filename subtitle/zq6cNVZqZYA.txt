let's talk about the best foods that can potentially prevent
or avoid a miscarriage there are no studies on this even prenatals apparently don't prevent
a miscarriage i think the reason for that is that if your diet isn't correct going into a pregnancy
and you're throwing on top of it some synthetic vitamins and high potency amounts it's not going
to create the big impact the most important thing is making sure that mother has prepared
a healthy body for that baby and that means consuming the right foods well in advance so if we
look at some of the data relating to miscarriages eighty percent of miscarriages happen within the
first trimester there could be some dna or genetic problem that gets activated from epigenetics
epigenetics actually control your genes and so if the mother's going through severe trauma or stress
or something in the environment that expresses the wrong gene then there could be problems so your
epigenetic environment is actually more important than your genes the fetus could be growing on the
outside of the uterus that could be one reason there could be an infection there could be some
type of chronic health problem like diabetes and autoimmune disease high blood pressure
fibroids so there's no space for that fetus to grow smoking can definitely be a big problem
alcohol can be another big problem being on certain type of drugs can cause this
problem high amounts of caffeine can cause a miscarriage seizures problems with the cord
mercury chemicals solvents pesticides and several of these things could be a nutritional deficiency
combined with being on the wrong diet if we take a low-carb diet you're going to greatly reduce
becoming a diabetic and especially if you're pregnant developing something called gestational
diabetes which is actually not so rare and that's primarily because that pregnant female
is consuming way too many carbohydrates now by also lowering your carbohydrates you're going to
reduce inflammation okay so you're going to help this condition right here blood pressure can be
controlled by consuming high potassium foods that would be large amounts of salads leafy greens
as well as magnesium same thing leafy greens and vitamin d it's very difficult to get your vitamin
d from food you can get some from fatty fish like salmon or the sun but i highly recommend
that if you're pregnant watching this right now to start taking at least 10,000 IUs of vitamin d
now also when you smoke you deplete vitamin c you get vitamin c from consuming enough vegetables
definitely bell peppers red peppers all type of peppers now fibroids actually can be stimulated
by consuming too much dairy especially because there's certain type of hormones and dairy that
can make the fibroids get bigger and then we have alcohol which depletes vitamin b1 and that can
create a whole series of issues and then down here we have mercury chemicals pesticides heavy metals
if you stick with organic foods you're going to reduce the amount of chemicals and pesticides in
the foods it's very important when that baby is developing that all the nutrients are there and
so instead of taking a synthetic prenatal i would always recommend a food based prenatal find a high
quality one in addition to consuming the key foods that are high in that individual vitamin like
folic acid you can get that from dark leafy green vegetables vitamin d you can get that from sun
cod liver oil vitamin c vegetables bell peppers red peppers vitamin e seeds like in sunflower
seeds and nuts almonds walnuts pecans omega-3 fatty acids which is very very important i'm
talking about dha primarily which supports the the brain fatty fish okay salmon huge now there
is some mercury in salmon and other fish but it just so happens that the fish are also loaded with
selenium that counters that and so that brings up trace minerals selenium is a trace mineral
trace minerals are very very important in the development of that baby so you can get that
from seafood or sea kelp talking about iodine zinc selenium and many others a vitamin b3
deficiency can really increase your risk for getting a miscarriage it's very easy to get b3
you can get it from turkey tuna chicken beef it's in a lot of foods but you may want to take this as
an extra supplement and the best amino acids to take if you're pregnant would be eggs and fish
there's other proteins that are good too but these are very usable by your body to give the growing
baby everything that it needs to develop correctly but here's one that's really really important fats
it's very important not to do a low-fat diet when you're pregnant you want grass-fed butter okay
on your food this will give you vitamin k2 that's very very important olives olive oil cod liver oil
very very important but these are some of the foods that i would recommend to potentially
avoid a miscarriage and make sure that baby develops in a very healthy way and if a mother
could actually start eating healthy like one to two years before the pregnancy i think that could
completely avoid miscarriage unless there is some genetic problem that you cannot fix and if you're
pregnant right now watching this go ahead and radically change your diet to including some of
these nutrients and of course it's not just about nutrients it's about avoiding certain things like
the junk foods the high level of carbohydrates the refined carbs and sugars all right thanks

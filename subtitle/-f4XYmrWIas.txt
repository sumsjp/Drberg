so I wanted to touch on vitamin D toxicity because there's a bit of fear
of taking too much vitamin D when in fact it might not be as scary as you
might think this document is by Mayo Clinic and it's a great article and it
says this vitamin D is not as toxic as was once thought a historical and
up-to-date perspective so this is just a brief history on why some people are
still to this day a little bit scared about taking too much vitamin D and the
40's vitamin D was used for rheumatoid arthritis but did you realize the amount
they were using were between two hundred thousand IUs and three hundred
thousand IUs I mean an average person might take six hundred IU's to a
thousand IU's right there talking 200 thousand to three hundred thousand and the
reason this works is vitamin D really helps the immune system and gets rid of
inflammation but then in the fifties they were actually fortifying the dairy
products and other products but there's been some complaints from parents with
children who had some side effects calcification and the kidneys and even
some calcification on their heart valves so the fortification of vitamin D and
dairy was banned in Europe but not necessarily in America or Canada or I
think even in the UK now years later they found out exactly why these
specific children had these problems it was because they had a rare genetic
disease called Williams syndrome in which case you don't want to take
vitamin D at all or else you'll have calcification in the valves of the heart
as well as kidney stones so if we take out this rare genetic disease there
wasn't a lot of side effects there was just a lot of benefits so nowadays when
you look at vitamin D it always says precaution make sure you don't take too
much you could experience a toxic effect now that statement is in all the
textbooks it's on all the websites so it's all over the place so people are a
bit nervous about that but if you go through this article
it would take fifty thousand to a hundred thousand IU's of vitamin D for
months two years before vitamin D became toxic now this is a lot more than what
people even consider toxic and when we say toxicity we're talking about
hypercalcemia too much calcium in the blood which could lead to kidney stones
however there's very little evidence if any evidence that shows that taking
vitamin D will lead to kidney stones at all so people end up taking smaller
amounts 1,000 to 2,000 IU's per day for a period of time well I did another
video which I will put a link down below that shows that if you're deficient and
you take a thousand milligrams it could take four months or longer before your
deficiency is satisfied to be able to put autoimmune conditions into
remission it does take large amounts for long
periods of time and on top of that if you wanted to decrease the risk of any
potential for this really what you do is you actually drink 2.5 litres of fluid
every single day and you avoid taking calcium as a supplement and you avoid
dairy and that will actually bring the risk for kidney stones way down so you
can then have the anti-inflammatory benefits for autoimmune conditions and
also realize that anything that I say in this video is not meant to replace your
medical care check with your doctor before taking any of my advice and
before you go check out this video on vitamin D dosage I think you'll find it
quite interesting

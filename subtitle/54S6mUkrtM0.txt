so I just want to mention because we're recommending higher fats some people get
concerned about their cholesterol the evidence out there thoroughly it's been
totally fabricated that cholesterol is a bad thing your body makes 2,000
milligrams every single day all your cells make cholesterol if it was so bad
then why doesn't this 2,000 milligrams that's like eating a lot of eggs why
doesn't that create a problem it doesn't because the function of cholesterol
actually heals the lesions of the heart when the heart breaks down because of
excess sugar or stress it gets a lesion it gets a little sore in there well
guess what cholesterol comes in and heals it so
this is why people think or have this illusion that it's clogging my arteries
well you've had a lesion your body's just trying to put a bandaid on it
telling someone that cholesterol will clog your arteries or that is the cause
of your clogged plaquing arteries is like telling someone that the white
blood cells are the cause of your infection it's not the infection
attracts the white blood cells okay so the other thing is that cholesterol is
not even a fad it's a it's a type of alcohol and even the cholesterol that's
measuring your blood LDL HDL those are high density lipoproteins they're not
even cholesterol they're protein carriers so one of the purpose of
cholesterol is it makes hormones it makes stress hormones and make sex
hormones okay it makes a vitamin D it's a precursor for your vile to help you
break down fats and absorb nutrients it's for the immune system people that
go on a low-fat low-cholesterol diet have a lot of immune issues and they're
always hungry too cholesterol replaces the cell structures a lot of your body's
made from cluster including the brain intestinal health you know when I used
to at one time I was a vegetarian and is the sickest I've ever been with my
digestion I couldn't digest all those foods but when I went to more heavier
fats oh my gosh my intestines just you know got better and that's because a lot
of the foods with cholesterol like butter and coconut oil feed the microbes
in your gut think about the main food for the microbes this called butyric
acid yes butyric acid is the byproduct of
eating fiber but it's also in butter feeds the microbes
okay so we have serotonin cholesterol is made to help serotonin function alright
and consuming cholesterol does not cause heart disease and also consuming
cholesterol does not increase cholesterol that's the facts of of
cholesterol and that is not myth it's been proven and so you don't have to be
afraid of it anymore

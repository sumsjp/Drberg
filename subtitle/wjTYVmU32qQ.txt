someone recently had a good question they had a stroke at one time and they
wanted to prevent future strokes so they wanted to know what would I suggest so I
wanted to do this video to talk about clots in general what they are what
creates them and what you can do to prevent them so a clot or a coagulation
is a group of cells that are kind of stuck together and they can't seem to
circulate through the vessels and they get hung up in certain parts of the body
if they get hung up in your heart you get a heart attack if they get hung up
in the brain you get a stroke if they get stuck in the lung it's called the
pulmonary embolism and you can start having chest pain breathing problems and
even cardiac arrest if they get stuck in the deep veins of your leg it's called a
deep vein thrombosis and that can cause pain redness lack of circulation a
weakness but you can get clots stuck anywhere in the body liver and the
kidney so in the body we have this balance of these clotting factors
especially vitamin K and a lot of anti clotting factors that are working
together to keep the blood at the right consistency but with a clot we're
dealing with fibrin which is a protein now there's certain things that increase
your risk of developing a clot and the big one is estrogen women that go
through pregnancy have a higher risk of getting clots simply because the amount
of estrogen and also the risk goes up if you're taking birth control pills or
estrogen replacement therapy another risk factor would be obesity in general
that will double the risk if you're a diabetic the risk goes up but if you're
overweight a diabetic taking birth control pills and estrogen replacement
therapy and you're pregnant your risk is really really high the real big thing
that increased your risk of getting strokes is if you have insulin
resistance which is behind obesity diabetes pre-diabetes but insulin
resistance occurs long before you become a diabetic so you could basically have
insulin resistance for 10 to 15 years and not even know it if you're focused
on your blood Sugar's I've done a lot of videos and insulin resistance I
will put something down below if you're new to it but it's a very important
condition to know about and prevent if you have insulin resistance the enzymes
that break down fibrin are diminished so you have decreased fibrinolysis you just
don't have the enzymes to break it down and your risk factors go up of
developing clots and this is why people that have insulin resistance have an
increased risk of getting a stroke alright what can you do about this well
number one you can handle this right here be cautious of how much estrogen
you're taking don't get pregnant so often I'm just kidding about that
obesity there's a lot of things you can do about that as well as diabetes but
there's some really powerful natural remedies that you can take to really
minimize the risk factor for getting a stroke first one is called Nadeau kinase
this is an enzyme that is made from the fermentation of soybeans and it's a very
powerful blood thinner that will help keep your blood from clotting
unnecessarily next one it's called Lumbrokinase what is this another enzyme
that is extracted from earthworms this too is a very powerful anti-clotting
natural remedy with very minimal side effects then we have Serrapeptase which
is another powerful enzyme it helps to break down protein things that shouldn't
be in your body and it's created from a bacteria from silkworms bromelain is a
good one as well this is from pineapples and this is very beneficial for the
heart and it also has been known to decrease risk of stroke and then we have
vitamin E which is a natural blood thinner and it does a lot of other
things as well it's a very powerful antioxidant before you start taking any
of these I would really have you focus on this with your diet healthy keto
intermittent fasting then add these right here and then you'll be in much
better shape all right thanks for watching

so today we're going to talk about the connection between the health of your
teeth and the health of your heart there's a
huge connection if you have problems in your teeth it
can more than double the problems in your heart what
they found is some of the bacteria in your teeth
are actually ending up in your heart so let's say for example
i don't know you have some infection in the gum or some infection underneath the
tooth what happens is certain microbes and
here's one of them right here strep gordoni can get into the
bloodstream travel down to the heart and that
particular bacteria can mimic a certain type of
protein fibrinogen and that could lead to clots
now they're also finding microbes in your teeth that are also showing up in
your joints and then here's another microbe a
type of strep viridance this was found in 84 percent
of stroke victims i'm going to put these links down below
but i think it's fascinating that microbes from your mouth are ending up
in different parts of your body in certain pathological states and then
we have this other connection we talk about vitamin k2 vitamin k2 is
all about keeping your bones strong keeping
your teeth strong and when you're missing k2
the calcium from your bones from your teeth
travel over into the arteries into the soft tissue into the joints
so people are deficient in k2 can end up with more
calcified arteries and a lot of dental problems i have some reality on this
growing up in the midwest consuming a lot of carbohydrates and
sugar especially refined sugars and i ended up with
cavities in every single tooth i went to the
dentist very very often and you know what i
craved as a child i couldn't get enough of it butter
i remember consuming like sticks of butter in one sitting
well guess where you get k2 and butter it's also in liver it's also in egg
yolks it's in certain cheeses you can also get
it in other things like fermented soy products
but butter has a good amount of cake too no wonder
i wanted butter the problem is i didn't just eat the butter by itself i
had to eat it with bread and other refined carbohydrates
and eventually caught up with me not just the k2 but just sugar in general
what it did for my health i hit my low point the worst point of my
health at age 28 i'm 29 now so i'm actually doing much
better but at 28 it was really really bad what's the moral of
the story don't eat sugar the sugar
feeds the microbes the microbes ferment okay fermented sugar and they give off
an acid and they create all sorts of destruction in your teeth
and the soft tissues around the teeth and in the presence of sugar your body
cannot use vitamin c vitamin c is necessary for the collagen
that holds the tooth into the bone also as a really good
natural antibiotic you can use one or more of these herbs
oregano is at the top of the list garlic would be probably number two
thyme and cloves all of these are really good as natural antibiotics
with no side effects especially if you have some type of
infection systemically in your body but of course
they won't work unless you change your diet if you're new to my channel and you
don't know what i'm talking about i put some links down below

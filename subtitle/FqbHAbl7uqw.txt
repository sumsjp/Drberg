hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about protein this
is part one of a series of three videos and we're going to talk about how much
protein you need okay now this is a very general answer but typically most people
need between three ounces and six ounces of protein per meal now if you have
kidney problems or liver problems you can eat less if you're an athlete
younger or going through a lot of stress you're getting a little bit more so this
is an average I'm about 190 to 193 I go with about 4 ounces of protein sometimes
a little bit more sometimes a bit less but if you're confused I suggest you
start with this range and then see how you feel okay because if you do too much
protein you're not going to be able to sleep at night so protein can stimulate
things okay now what is 3 ounces of protein that would I want to give you
some reference it's it's like having two chicken legs okay or our chicken thigh
or some meat that's the size of a deck of cards okay so it's like 25 grams or
maybe three and a half eggs okay I actually do four eggs in the morning
but I might do just a small amount of protein at night so it doesn't have to
be consistently three to six grams approach or three ounces of protein
every single meal it can vary alright and then six ounces that would be like
one chicken thigh or just double two decks of cards right that's 50 grams of
protein but the majority of people consume way to a much protein and what
happens is that that protein ends up harming the liver over time now
typically protein is used for both repairing body tissue like blood organs
hormones nails skin collagen connective tissue joints all that is from protein
also your body can use protein as a fuel source okay so it can actually do both
another point I was going to recommend is that when you eat protein I suggest
try to consume it after you have your that's
okay don't eat the protein first it's that there's a tendency to want to eat
too much protein if you do that first okay so three to six ounces of protein
in the next video we're going to talk about the relationship between protein
and starch like meat and potatoes I'll see you then hey guys thank you so much

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the macro
confusion on a ketogenic and intermittent fasting plan okay
macros are the percentages of carbohydrates proteins and fats on a
certain plan okay that's what that means now some of you don't have a confusion
and others do have a confusion and if you really understood this before you're
really gonna be confused after I'm done with this so the first thing I'm gonna
say is I'm really sorry you're gonna kill me after doing this video because
it'll put you in a little bit of a confusion but at the end I'll clear it
out okay so watch this whole video all right and I'm sorry that I had to do
this but I just need to bring it up I mean this is why I haven't done this
video before because I didn't want to add another layer until maybe people got
started and starting becoming successful because if you watch this video as
someone that's just starting you're probably gonna give up because it is a
little confusing but let me just kind of let the cat out of the bag and explain
why it's confusing okay now typically if you look up keto you're
gonna see that the percentages are 5% carbs 20% protein and 75% fat okay but
now we're gonna add in another variable we're gonna add in in a minute fasting
which confuses everything okay we're gonna go to two meals a day and then for
some people down to one meal a day okay because those percentages then change
okay now just to keep this simple I'm gonna
be using throughout this video 1,800 calories for three meals a day on
average it could be more it could be less
1,500 calories total for two meals a day okay and 1200 calories for one meal a
day and this is just average of what I found people do alright it could be
different for you but the point is that these calories reduction don't go down
in a certain rate they have their own rate of change in other words if you're
starting out with three meals 1,800 calories
and then down to one male we're gonna reduce the amount of total calories at a
certain rate that has a certain variable on itself that's not really dependent on
three males two males and one middle so it has no mathematical similarity so
that's number one confusion okay because what happens as you reduce the frequency
of eating okay you start retaining more nutrients so if you're going to consume
1800 calories for three meals and keep the calories the same and 1800 calories
for one male it's gonna be really hard to consume that much fruit okay so we
have to reduce that and that throws up the percentages right there all right so
that's confusion number one or actually could be two and then we have another
variable I wanted to add in their actual non starchy vegetables that are not
included in these carbs right here these carbs are like berries avocado nuts
tomatoes carrot beet okay these carbohydrates are non starchy like leafy
greens broccoli kale these other vegetables and this comes out to like
five percent okay so what I want to do is I want to show you in three meals
ideally you should have ten cups divided by three so what does that come out to
three and a half cups of salad per meal okay just envision that so we want at
the end of the day ten cups of vegetable or salad for a three mil when you go to
to meal because your body is more efficient you're gonna go eight cups of
vegetable or salad so that would be like four and four four cups four cups with
each meal that's not hard to do right and then when you get down to one meal
the salad or vegetable would be seven cups of vegetable or salad and again
that's a nice sized salad and again this is just average if I'm going to do one
meal today I'll do ten cups of salad but I'm just giving you just kind of what
I'm gonna be building into this to make it doable for the average person
because as you reduce your frequency of eating you actually do not need the same
amount of nutrients because you go through different metabolic adaptations
so your body actually holds more nutrients and if you can keep it to 20
grams or less that would be even better okay but for going from three meals to
two meals to one meal you can keep this the same okay you can keep this the same
so in other words keep in 20 grams 20 grams 20 grams that's going to alter the
percentage of total calories so that's another confusion people have but now
the thing to focus on is just keep your carbs below 30 grams okay 20 would be
ideal lat 30 on average whether it's three meals two meals or one meal just
for the day okay you can divide it up any way you want alright now the next
confusion I'm sorry to do this to you we're gonna talk about proteins the
percentage of total calories will stay the same 20 percent 20 percent and 20
percent over here that carbohydrates that's going to change the percentage of
total calories of carbs are going to change but protein is going to stay the
same all right but what's gonna change is the grams of protein in the or the
ounces okay so on average on a three meal a day program you'll do four ounces
like three to six but let's just talk about let's just use four as an example
so four ounces of protein per meal on a two meal per day in a minute fasting
five ounces per meal okay that's 75 grams if you're doing a one meal a day
eight ounces of protein for that meal okay again that's an average you could
have more a little less so that's the confusion number that six yeah okay
don't worry I have more confusion for you so we have that variable right here
and then we have the fat variable okay so this is the wild wild card because
what happens in the beginning when you're doing this program
you're gonna need more fat as you start doing it you'll need a little less fat
because your body is eating your own fat so you want to basically go based on
your hunger and not doing too much so you're not too stuffed
okay but an average for a three meal program you would do a hundred and forty
grams per day two meal would be 113 grams and for a one meal you do 86 grams
of fat okay so that's the confusion and now here's the solution okay I am
building a calculator for you so you can plug in what you ate and it'll tell you
if it's correct or what to focus on okay so you're welcome I'm gonna really work
on trying to get that Dennis soon as possible number two the meal plans on my
site under recipe I already have all this stuff built into it so all you have
to do is go there and follow it and you can visualize the foods that you should
use alright so I hope that helped you maybe not now you're totally pissed off
at me but I wanted to kind of bring this up let the cat out of the bag and we do
have a solution but it's a little complex let's focus on that and not
these complexes but for those people that want to know there you have it

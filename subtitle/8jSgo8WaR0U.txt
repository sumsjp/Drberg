so we're going to talk about the salad bloating syndrome
you'll find this in any medical disease textbook and i'm just kidding because i
just made it up right now but it is a situation that comes up now and then i would say about
10 to 15 of the time now as you know i recommend a lot of vegetables between
seven to ten cups so and occasionally someone will start bloating and then my name is mud so
i want to talk about if you start consuming more salads or vegetables and you start bloating
there are four situations going on that we have to do something about okay number one you may have
something called sibo small intestinal bacteria overgrowth this is a situation where the bacteria
the friendly bacteria that should normally be in the large intestine
is not there it's in the small intestine and it's robbing all of the nutrients that are supposed to
be absorbed in the small intestine ninety percent of all the food nutrients should be absorbed in
the small intestine that's the first part well if you have the majority of bacteria in that location
they're going to compete for this nutrition and take this away from you not to mention you're
going to start fermenting fiber in the wrong place in your small intestine and you're going to just
bloat you're gonna feel very very uncomfortable so and if you have sibo and i put a link down below
on a video that describes it more in depth and there's also a test that you can do
i would recommend you avoid plant foods for a while for about two months you may want to go on
a carnivore diet and take betaine hydrochloride which is going to acidify your stomach
take about 5 to 10 of these tablets before each meal and take some oregano oil okay so that's
what i would recommend for that situation the second situation is where you have leaky gut
that is where the lining of the gut is there's holes in it and you have increased permeability
and so all sorts of things can go through that hole and create a reaction with your immune system
but primarily it's going to be the lectins in the vegetables so that's going to create an immune
reaction it's going to be in the night shades so that would be tomatoes bell pepper eggplant
it's definitely going to be very high in beans legumes especially peanuts and grains of course
you're not going to be consuming grains if you're on the ketogenic diet so we don't have to worry
about that so if you have this severe leaky gut situation and you tried vegetables it doesn't work
i would recommend doing more carnivore but make sure that your meats are pasture-raised grass-fed
okay because you don't want to consume meats that have been fed grains which are high on omega-6
which also are loaded with lectins that could be a big problem so we want grass-fed grass-finished
meats now as far as consuming fats in general you want to avoid all the seed oils for sure
it's highly inflammatory the fats that are real safe that are really healing for the gut are the
saturated fats as in lard which is pig fat and i'm not talking about the pigs that are processed
by conventional means i'm talking about like something that you would probably order for
online that's a lot healthier that's from a farmer that feeds these animals correctly and and doesn't
involve the factory farming and then we have talo which is b-fat which is actually very healing for
the gut it will not increase inflammation and so you don't want to be afraid of those fats in
fact you want to probably cook more with them and stews maybe in sausages and in soups but it's very
important to have fatty protein and almost double the fat to your protein ratios in weight not
calories if you look at calories it'd be like over 80 percent fat to protein so we're talking
about weight so like a two to one ratio in very low carbohydrates i created a video on leaky gut
i put the link down below the third situation is you just don't have enough good bacteria
and so i recommended this to several people and it worked like a charm by taking some probiotics
when you consume the salad and it seems to work but make sure that the probiotic that you consume
is a non-dairy probiotic it takes a certain quantity of microbes to digest a lot of fiber
if you overwhelm the large intestine with too much fiber without enough microbes you're going
to get bloating all right so that's a little tip take some probiotics it seems to work all right
last scenario you're just sensitive to certain vegetables like broccoli brussels sprouts and
there's there's could be quite a few personally i cannot consume broccoli it will rip my intestines
up it creates a lot of bloating and pain cabbage i can do cabbage cabbage is very unique cabbage
is really good for ulcers it's good for gastritis you might do very well in cabbage but you may not
but chances are you probably will be so that would be a really safe vegetable for most people and
then just regular lettuce or even arugula pretty safe so you want to focus on those vegetables and
maybe not too many cruciferous type vegetables hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

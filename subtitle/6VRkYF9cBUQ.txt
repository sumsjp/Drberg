so this is a topic that i think i'm
pretty qualified in addressing simply
because i've been in practice for
30 years and i also trained over 2500
doctors in my methods and
this information is very
counter-intuitive it's not taught in
schools and it is highly effective as
you're about to find out so if you have
these muscle knots in the back of your
neck and your in your shoulders up here
or your mid-back
you're going to like this video so what
are these knots well they're little
balls of contracted muscle there's so
many gurus out there and so many videos
that are talking about you just need to
massage the knot
do trigger point therapy um use
different massage devices to break up
these muscle knots and uh yeah it works
for a minute until it comes right back
now out of all the patients that i had
with muscle knots
i think i had the most problem with
muscle knots for years before i figured
this out so massaging these little knots
doing hot packs cold packs trigger point
therapy stretching the knots stimulating
the knots using electrostimulation
is honestly i think a big waste of time
so here's what you need to know
muscles always work in pairs now there
are a lot of muscles that work together
but there are usually two major
pairs of muscle to create motion okay
you take a look at your arm you have the
bicep that contracts and the tricep that
extends and that creates motion now when
we're talking about the back part of the
neck that extends the head back
and then the muscles on the opposing
side
bring the head forward right here now if
we're talking about the upper
shoulder area right here you have
muscles that bring the shoulder up and
you have muscles that bring the shoulder
down
and when we're talking about the
mid-back we have the muscles that bring
the shoulders backward and then we have
these muscles called the pecs that bring
the shoulders forward so the way you
need to look at this is that
all muscles have an opposing action
all muscles work in pairs and they are
electrically coordinated with nerves
okay so
anytime you stimulate one muscle
the electrical circuits on the opposite
muscle has an off switch so in order for
you to contract
the opposing muscle needs to relax and
so we can use that information so
instead of like massaging or doing
trigger point therapy on a contraction
why don't we work on the opposite muscle
and guess what it works like magic so
anytime you have a muscle knot
what you want to do is you want to
figure out the opposing muscle or what's
called the antagonistic muscle
and stretch that muscle and you will
find that the muscle that's contracted
will melt like butter and a frying pan
all right so let's start with the back
of the neck so you have these muscles
that are all tight and the name of these
muscles if you want to sound smart are
called splenius capitus and splenius
cervicus otherwise known as the muscles
in the back of your neck so anytime you
have tightness in the back part of the
neck you want to stretch the front part
of the neck now you can very simply just
do this
going back okay
probably stretch that maybe five six
seven times okay and then notice how
your neck feels but there's another
muscle called the scalenes which is on
the front part of the neck right here
and to stretch that one you're gonna so
you're gonna rotate and tilt back like
this
and you do the other side
and you're usually going to find one
side that's a lot tighter and that's the
area you're going to work on and then
when you compare that to the back of
your neck you're going to feel it's
really really loose so in this video i
really want to just kind of teach you
the concepts um
as far as how many times to do it and
how long to do it that all depends on
how bad it is you know you can stretch
for maybe 10 to 30 seconds and you can
do that three times just to keep it
really simple now the next thing i want
to talk about is the knots in the upper
back this is really really common
it's usually in the trapezius muscle or
a muscle right underneath it called a
levator
scapula muscle and both these muscles do
a very similar action of just raising
the shoulders like this right so if
you're sitting behind a desk all day
doing this you can imagine those muscles
are going to be tight
so now the question is what muscle does
the opposite what muscle pulls the traps
downward well it just so happens both of
those muscles that bring the shoulders
up
are opposed
by the muscle called the latissimus
dorsi and this latissimus dorsi
attaches to the back of the humerus
right here back of the arm and then
comes down onto the rib cage and then
attaches to some other connective tissue
underneath the arm and so to stretch the
lat muscle there's many different ways
um
you can hang from some
bar to stretch this muscle right here
if you don't have a bar you can actually
take a simple chair and get on your
knees and bring your elbows
on the chair and you can basically
extend the arm up to the head and so
you're stretching this this space
underneath your arm this distance right
here and you're pulling the latissimus
dorsi
so it creates a really nice stretch so
if you have tightness in the upper
shoulders and you stretch the lat
just notice how loose that's going to
feel and so instead of having someone
start massaging and just beating up this
muscle up here you stretch the opposing
muscle your lats honestly if i had a
choice between
doing the stretch on the chair or
hanging i like hanging because that
really can stretch the latissimus dorsi
and give you tremendous relief and not
just on the trap right here but also on
your shoulder now there's another muscle
that i would recommend stretching it's
called the latissimus dorsi these are
muscles on top of the rib cage that
attach to the back of your scapula and
the simple way to stretch it is to sit
in the chair sideways
and bring your arm over the back part of
the chair
and then take your upper torso and
stretch
in the opposite direction okay so you're
stretching the upper torso in the
opposite direction and you're going to
stretch your scalenes while you're
sitting up nice and tall what that's
going to do is going to create the
stretch that's going to melt the
trapezius muscle as well as a muscle
underneath that so that's a really good
stretch as well and you can stretch and
hold for 30 seconds and do that just
three times and you'll see some amazing
results okay so now let's just move to
the mid back
there are two sets of muscles called the
rhomboid muscles they bring your
shoulder bones which are your scapulas
backwards right through and here okay
and they bring them up too but they kind
of bring them back this way and so the
muscles that oppose that are your pec
muscles okay these muscles in the front
part and so a really good pec stretch
would be in a corner of your room where
you're bringing your arms up and then
you're pushing your chest
forward to stretch the pec muscles now
you can also do this in a door frame as
well but basically you just get into
stretch mode and you just stretch and
hold for 30 seconds and then do that
again three times and notice how your
rhomboids your mid back will feel really
really good all right so those are the
three areas of your body that have knots
and some stretches that you can do
however okay hopefully you made it this
far in this video because
eighty percent of all these knots
are really being referred
by your
digestion okay something in your
digestive tract
mostly the gallbladder
and many times it could be the little
tubes or ducts between the liver and the
gallbladder that are are filled with
sludge and that backs up to the liver
which creates
referral
tightness
in your rhomboid especially on the right
side
in your trap or your levator scapulae
muscle on the right side
can be on the left side too
or the neck muscle right through here so
if you are going to stretch
and you're not feeling a lot of change
or relief
then you better put attention on the
digestive system so
let's say right now you have some neck
tightness or upper trap or right
rhomboid pain this is what i want you to
do take your hands
and massage underneath your right rib
cage just off the center
just feel around there and feel for the
tightness and press in and hold to your
tolerance
for about 20 seconds okay so do that
right now
and then notice that that gives you some
relief now we know your problem is
coming from your digestive system which
means that there's something you're
eating that you probably shouldn't be
eating and so for those people that are
new to what i recommend for eating i put
that link down below because that's
going to ultimately correct this problem
but most the time it's a gallbladder
problem
and
i'm not talking about stones i'm talking
about just
your bile is too thick it's called bile
sludge and the best way to loosen that
up is to use a very high quality bile
salt
supplement and that will help loosen up
this sludge so it can drain out and give
you a lot of relief and of course the
bile salt that i recommend is called
gall bladder formula and i did put the
link down below because that formula has
a lot of things in it it has things for
the stomach it has things to thin the
bile it has bile salts it has enzymes
and so it's a pretty complete product so
i just gave you a complete solution on
what to do for these muscle knots and i
think the next most important video is
to show you how to do this manual type
therapy on the gallbladder so i put it
up right here check it out
you

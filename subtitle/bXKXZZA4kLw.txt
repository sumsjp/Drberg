take a wild guess who eats the most sugar i'm talking about age groups this group right here
between the ages of 11 and 18 teenagers they consume 74 grams of added sugar we're
only going to talk about added sugar right now every single day that's 18 and a half teaspoons
of sugar every single day but check this out if you're one and a half years old to three years old
you consume 36 grams of sugar that's nine teaspoons every single day that's crazy now
that's not even the tip of the iceberg because what i'm going to tell you next is going to shock
you there's some missing information or confusion around the topic of sugar and carbohydrates
an average person does not realize that all carbohydrates turn into sugar in the
body and i'm talking about the bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes
muffins juice there's an exception fiber even though fiber is a carbohydrate it is not digested
by the body because it doesn't turn into sugars your microbes your friendly bacteria in your gut
eat the fiber and this is why vegetables are good because they're low in sugar and high in fiber
now as far as fruits go most fruits are grown as a hybrid in other words they've done certain things
to manipulate the seeds to make them higher in sugar to make them sweeter like the honey crisp
apple which has 19 grams of sugar even bananas and watermelon a long ago we didn't have these
super sweet fruits an apple probably was a crab apple which was very very tart and very very sour
so the only fruit that i recommend are the berries blueberries raspberries blackberries
and strawberries in small amounts now if we take all the carbs that someone eats we get an average
of 275 grams of carbs every single day now that comes out to 68.75 teaspoons of sugar each day
that's a little more than a half a pound a day it's .6 pounds of sugar every single day that
an average person is consuming now for the year that comes out to 219 pounds so an average person
consumes 219 pounds or 99 kilograms of sugar every single year that is completely insane especially
if you understand what's normal in the body if you take normal blood sugars let's say 180 milligrams
per deciliter that calculates to only about one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood okay so
that's that's not a lot and that one tiny teaspoon of sugar can be made from your own body out of
non-carbohydrate source it doesn't even have to come from the diet it can come from your fat it
can come from protein so what could happen to a body when you feed it 68.75 teaspoons of sugar
every single day you get a chronic exposure of sugar to all of your tissues let's go through all
the different things that could happen number one it's going to affect the heart and a lot of these
conditions can occur even before you get diabetes but diabetes is usually inevitable take a look at
the statistics of diabetes and it's just it's like an epidemic but chronic exposure to glucose on the
heart valves destroys the heart causes high blood pressure it leads to a clot and even a stroke
it can affect your teeth it can affect your breath because sugar feeds certain bacteria that give you
bad breath it severely affects the brain it can give you add affecting your attention and your
focus because it affects the cognitive part of your brain which is memory focus and concentration
as well as your ability to learn it can definitely affect your overall
mood making you irritable giving you anxiety and even depression it can keep your brain in a state
of fog so you can't think clearly and over the years it can lead to dementia and alzheimer's
which is considered diabetes type 3. it can definitely affect the hormones take a look at
someone who has pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome the high levels of sugar that raise insulin
increase another hormone called androgens if you're female you get excess facial hair you
have hair loss your voice goes a little bit deeper you get a gut it can severely affect your skin in
a negative way causing not just acne but all sorts of inflammatory conditions of your skin it creates
a lot of inflammation in your joints creating all the itises bursitis tendinitis arthritis
it can affect your endurance if you play sports you're just going to run out of gas prematurely
you're going to be tired most of the time you're going to have the need for glasses
eventually simply because high levels of sugar running through your blood vessels go through the
inner eye and affect the circulation to the nerves causing a lot of problems with the eye including
diabetic neuropathy eventually cataracts glaucoma blurriness and it can even affect the shape of
your lens alright next one is the obvious one belly fat once you fill up the liver with fat
it spills over around the organs causing belly fat if you have belly fat there's a good chance
you have a fatty liver and the fatty liver leads to inflammation which then leads to scar tissue
so that could actually develop into cirrhosis which is advanced scar tissue
of the liver nerve pain in the bottom of the feet and the fingertips but other than that i
think there's no other symptoms that you'll get so you're going to be good to go all right so i
think it would be a really good exercise for you to take just one day and evaluate how much sugar
you consume per day you can get one of these apps that measures the carbs so you get some idea of
how much sugar you actually eat on a yearly basis and maybe that will be very motivating to avoid
all of these conditions thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

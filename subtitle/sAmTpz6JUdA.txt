let's discuss the foods for dry eyes now
the glands that produce tears in the
little ducks that the tears drain
through
are controlled by vitamin a so vitamin a
has everything to do with controlling
what those cells that line the inside of
the
gland and also the inside of the body
like the little ducts
and also other tissue that line the
inside of your body
so if there's a vitamin a deficiency the
inner lining of the
ducts as well as the gland kidney
form it can get thicker the tissue can
get
rougher and the actual production of the
tear or fluids
diminish so an average person who has
dry eyes
not knowing this will tend to get the
drops in the eyes
and hopefully they won't go to the
steroid drops because that creates all
sorts of
side effects so the three top
vitamin a symptoms would be number one
dry eyes
night blindness you can actually go
blind there's
quite a high percentage of children in
certain countries
that are vitamin a deficient when
they're very young and they go blind
so there's a huge connection between
vitamin a and your vision
and then blurred vision now vitamin a
does a lot of other things too
related to your immune system your
mucous membranes
but for what we're talking about dry
eyes is definitely a vitamin a
deficiency
now i don't recommend you go out and buy
a vitamin a for this simply because
a lot of the vitamin a out there is
synthetic and that comes with the
package there's a lot of side effects
but here are the foods that are very
high in vitamin a the top one is cod
liver oil you can also get
cod liver in a can it's actually quite
good i put a link down below
liver has a lot of vitamin a
fatty fish has a good amount of vitamin
a
butter and ghee have vitamin a
cheese has vitamin a especially if it's
fatty or cheese
egg yolks are loaded with vitamin a and
beef
has vitamin a now unfortunately the
actual
definition of vitamin a also includes
pre-vitamin a beta-carotene and
some other carotenoids
this is not actually vitamin a even
though it's classified as vitamin a it's
because it has to be converted into the
active form of vitamin a which is
retinol
so when you buy food and you look at the
back of the label and it says has this
much vitamin a
don't be deceived because they could be
talking about the precursor
now what is the significance of that
well the conversion
to the active form of vitamin a is not
that great
in other words it takes 20 molecules
of the precursor to convert into one
molecule
of the active form of vitamin a
not only that 50 percent of the
population
has a genetic variant it's called a
polymorphism
which prevents this conversion to a
certain degree
so don't depend on your vitamin a for
the precursors
now beta-carotene and other carotenoids
which are phytonutrients
have great benefits other great benefits
their antioxidants
they do a lot but they're not the same
as retinol
so if you're trying to fix your dry eyes
and you're taking beta-carotene
it may not work retinol is
only in animal products so if you're a
vegan in your dry eyes
this could be the reason you're not
converting to the active form of retinol
now there's other problems as well let's
say you're consuming these foods right
here
and you still have dry eyes well it
could be you have inflammation in the
gut
because you had a history of antibiotics
it could be because you have some
problem with your liver
fatty liver or your gallbladder or you
had your gallbladder removed and you're
deficient in bile
or you have sibo small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth which
robs certain nutrients the way you would
know that is
every time you eat you feel extremely
bloated especially with
fiber and vegetables and i already
mentioned fatty liver but it could also
be
an inflamed liver so anything wrong with
the liver can impair the ability
to absorb vitamin a and vitamin a is
stored in the liver
but as it starts to fill up with fat you
lose the ability
to store vitamin a and other fat soluble
vitamins
all right i think i covered everything i
wanted to cover thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto

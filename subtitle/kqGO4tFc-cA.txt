well happy new year today i'm going to give you some tips on your new year's resolution
first question is do you have one if you don't i'm going to help you today most people at the
beginning of the year have a weight loss goal i'm going to recommend that you change your goal
to having more health because weight loss is an effect or a byproduct of getting healthy and
so when you come up with your goals definitely include additional things that relate to health
like your energy level your stress tolerance feeling calmer the sense of well-being looking
younger would be a good indicator that you are getting healthy strength flexibility
digestion personally my weak link and my goal for this next year is right here flexibility
from all of my old injuries from doing wrestling and motorcycle accidents this is my weak link
and so my goal this year is to become very very flexible and so if you wouldn't mind go ahead and
write down in the comment section which one of these would you like to improve most now
i'm going to give you a couple tips but overall this is an important one you don't want to be so
serious when you're trying to achieve your goals the more desperate you are the less you are going
to achieve your goals you want to have a carefree attitude positive and certain about it but not
too serious first thing is you want to define your goal exactly what do you want to achieve
you don't want to keep it too big because that's not very certain and so the more certain you are
about things the more you're going to hit your goal number two you should write it down i use
these little notebooks for goals and i write all my goals down here and i read them on a regular
basis and they're all very exact and very specific number three you want to use the right knowledge
to achieve your goals that's why i recommend watching my information what's really amazing
is last year i would say in october it was all of a sudden on the internet youtube and google
you couldn't find my videos anymore in fact you have to scroll way down to find a video
on a certain topic when before i was ranking pretty high and so there's been a huge shift
on the internet and it's very difficult to find the correct information most of the information
on the first five pages of google i believe is very low quality and it's false information and
i know you're not shocked by that but that's just what's going on right now and so your success in
anything is related to having the right knowledge and being able to apply it next tip number four
don't compare yourself with your friend with your spouse with others compare yourself to yourself
over time and because simply everyone is so different all right number five some people
need support i don't know if you know this but i trained some keto consultants and they work for me
and they're highly trained and you may need help from one of my consultants to get started
to stay more consistent and on track or you may need some help because you just plateaued
whatever the reason just realize i have keto consultants and i put the number down below
there's two services that i have if you have a quick question it's free you can
call a keto consultant and they can answer it if you need more time more health there is a
small fee that goes along with this but you can get more information with the link down
below all right number six estimation of effort you want to allow from enough time for this to
work sometimes our estimation of effort is just not quite correct so we're expecting
you know this certain miracle in this period of time and it takes a lot longer especially
if you're like many others who has really bad insulin resistance which is the barrier behind
a stuck set point where you hit this certain weight and you can't seem to break through it
that's because you have instant resistance and this could take
weeks it could take months and it could even take up to a year but if you're consistent and
you stay with it you will eventually overcome that barrier so go ahead and define your goals
exactly write them down and apply some of these tips right here all right thanks for watching
and i will see you in a lot more videos this year okay before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

now of course we all know for a fact
that exercise can improve your
cardiovascular function it can increase
your lifespan
but if that's true then why are certain
people dropping dead of heart attacks
from
exercise that's the topic for today is
there an actual danger to exercise and
the answer is
yes and no it really depends on
certain variables
so exercise is a type of movement in
your body that has a unique intensity to
it a duration to it a recovery to it and
a frequency to it and there's a million
different types of exercises based on
these four variables okay but exercise
can be a positive or a negative stress
depending on these variables right here
and i'm talking about a positive stress
where it causes your body to
adapt to become stronger
versus a negative stress which which
breaks down your body and then you don't
recover and you have injuries and you
have other problems which i'm going to
give to
so the first thing i want to talk about
and i'm going to put these research
studies down below because i just went
through a deep dive into high intensity
exercise and i found some interesting
things okay i want to share with you
um apparently when you do prolonged
moderate to high intensity exercise
can actually lower your immune system
okay at least temporarily
so apparently moderate to intense
exercise can act as an immunosuppressive
activity okay because it can impair
your t cells because it's a type of
stress
in one of the studies i found something
quite interesting all it takes to lower
your immune system is one intense
exercise bout
and that lowering of the immune system
can last for days
but this all really depends on
several things which i'm going to get to
primarily your ability to recover
your health reserve
and some other things also when you have
this sustained high level intense
exercise
you actually increase your risk of viral
infections especially in the lungs
another side effect would be an
increased risk of heart attacks in blood
clots i'm talking about
high intensity now i am going to qualify
that with a few things in a bit for
example like this really depends on your
duration
so you have this high intensity how long
do you go and that's why i always
recommend something called hit
high intensity interval training
with the key of hit being a short
duration so when you do hit exercises
you do in high intensity but they're not
very long okay so that greatly reduces
these side effects
so what i'm describing is more of a high
intensity that's prolonged okay high
sustained endurance type exercise
now in certain endurance sports
whether you're doing cycle or running
there's an increased risk of irregular
heart rhythms okay
so why is that well apparently when you
exercise this moderate to high intensity
over a period of time
your heart gets stronger it gets bigger
now you might think that's a good thing
but the problem with the heart is that
it has
a set of pacemakers okay that regulate
the heart rhythm and apparently when the
heart gets too big
it throws off those pacemakers so that's
what's behind this heart rhythm
problem
so even though they're not developing a
like a pathogenic enlarged heart which
is called cardiomegaly it's kind of a
exercise induced cardiomegaly which
affects the heart rhythm and of course
high intensity exercise increases the
risk of getting injuries
it can increase inflammation
inside
the blood vessels called endothelial
injury why because there's a lot of
oxygen going through the body and that
oxygen
is oxidative stress
to the inside of the arteries
there's even something called
exercise-induced arterial endo fibrosis
what does that mean it means that
there's inflammation inside the arteries
that then turns into fibrosis and it
creates
kind of a narrowing of your arteries and
even a vasospasm and so this is not very
common but it can happen to highly
trained cyclists and endurance
athletes when you're doing marathons or
you're doing these long distance
exercise type activities boy does it
create a tremendous amount of stress on
your body you have to have
a lot of recovery even the exercise
program called crossfit i think
that's great for young people but once
you get to my age it's not good because
the amount of recovery that they give
you is just so short i mean i like
crossfit if they can just increase the
recovery time
a bit more because it's an incredible
workout and i almost had a heart attack
when i attempted to do it
actually that was even like five years
ago because i'm 57 but
it's intense you have to be in shape and
have a really good recovery to do
crossfit
now the other thing
that high intensity exercise will do is
raise
cortisol i've talked about this in a
recent video cortisol
paralyzes your immune system it actually
shuts down the immune system okay
but low intensity exercise actually
lowers cortisol this is why if you're
stressed out long walks is a good thing
so the real important thing to take away
from
this data is that you must adjust the
workout to your individual recovery
level each person has a different
recovery i'll give you a quick example i
had a lady who came to my office long
ago
and we had an exercise recovery training
uh little section in the office so i had
her do the bike and she raised her pulse
rate to like 158
send her home she comes back the next
day the pulse rate is still 158 okay
there's basically no recovery and so the
recovery is not a passive thing it's an
active
thing that's in your nervous system
that's like a push down wave even if you
were to run upstairs right now get your
pulse rate high
and then you would stop and then you
would check your pulse rate it should
start coming down what causes it to come
down it's an active thing it's actually
the parasympathetic nervous system which
gets activated that's actually pushing
your
pulse rate down
and in practice i had a machine that
measured the parasympathetic nervous
system which is pretty cool and that
technology is called heart rate
variability which you can actually uh
check both
the parasympathetic system and also the
sympathetic nervous system
so number one you need to adjust the
exercise to your recovery if you could
find someone
or buy a device maybe there's one for
your cell phone that can measure heart
rate variability you can find out your
recovery and then you'll have some
objective test if you don't have
something like that you can actually
check your pulse rate and measure the
recovery time after your exercise is it
coming down towards where you started or
not and that would be after a minute and
i will put a link down below of how to
test that but the whole goal is just to
avoid over training
i have another example i was in practice
this lady came in she wasn't losing
weight at all and i'm not kidding she
was exercising
six
hours a day
seven days a week i am not kidding and
she's wondering why she's not losing
weight
absolutely positively over training i
mean it's just crazy
another example i had someone else
who
couldn't lose weight if her life
depended on it she went to the gym
and for a whole year she worked out
every other day and she lost one pound
after a whole year
well i found out her sleeping was crappy
so we fixed her sleeping
and we didn't even have her exercise we
we changed her diet too and she started
losing weight a lot more than that one
pound so
you know it's all about the recovery one
really important nutrient to take if you
have low recovery if you're at risk for
heart problems
is vitamin d because one of the first
vitamin d deficiency symptoms is weak
muscle and i'm not talking about just
your skeletal muscle i'm talking about
the cardiac muscle too so this is very
protective against heart attacks and it
can strengthen your immune system at the
same time
number three omega-3 fatty acids fish
oils sardines cod liver oil all real
good for recovery if you work out and
you want to speed up your recovery
omega-3
can help you and number four increase
the recovery between
your hit workout so if you're gonna do
this intense exercise for a minute
don't just recover for 30 seconds
go two or three minutes of recovery
before you start that intense exercise
about again and that also has to do with
the frequency of days of the week that
you work out
if you're over the age of
45 or 50
like myself you may benefit from having
a couple more days between your workout
so let's say you work out two days a
week
or three days a week but you at least
give enough time to recover and with
some people depending on the intensity
of that workout
i will just say
just rest for like three or four days
and oh my goodness do they feel better
start losing weight things start coming
back because they've been having this
low grade inflammation and just not
giving their body a chance to fully
recover between the exercise bouts now
why do people drop dead of heart attacks
from exercise perfectly young healthy
people
for various reasons if they're doing
some type of moderate to intense
exercise sustained activity
and
there's anything else at the same time
that's affecting their immune system
that can put them over the edge okay
because their immune system is already
predisposing them to have a problem with
the heart
so and i have done videos on this topic
i'm not going to get too far into the
woods with that but anything added
stress to your body while you're doing
intense exercise
can push you over the edge also a lack
of sleep can increase the risk for
having more problems
higher carbohydrates can put you more at
risk because the high carb diet
increases the sympathetic nervous system
and also prevents sleeping also low
nutrients the main nutrient deficiency
that affects the heart especially angina
or heart attacks is vitamin e
so
the more stress you go through the less
sleep you have
the more vitamin e you're going to need
especially for the heart and i would
recommend tocatrinals versus the
tocopherol
brands okay now we have age right the
older you are the less intense you
really can handle so this variable alone
can put you at risk for a lot of issues
now there's always exceptions i had
another patient who came in
80 years old
you know looked pretty young
i did that test on him that recovery
test
and
he had
a recovery of like a 28 year old okay
and i was shocked
and one thing that was interesting is
that
he was walking his dog in the dark and
he tripped in a hole and he fell down
and he knocked himself out and he had
some bleeding in his um his skin and
things and within like a day he just
healed right up amazing right
so this guy
apparently when he was younger
took
the olympics in water polo and he's been
maintaining
his health ever since with exercise at
least
and he can still at 80 years old hold
his breath for three minutes underneath
the water so again there's always an
exception to the rule and if you can
keep up your training consistently and
not over train
you know you can actually really create
a bulletproof immune system
altitude
apparently the higher altitude you are
the more risk you are when you exercise
for heart problems like right now where
i'm living it's worth 3000 feet above
sea level when i have friends or family
that come out to where i live and we're
walking up hills boy they get out of
breath real easy because they have not
adapted if we have them exercised that
can add another strain so these are just
variables i want to bring your attention
to so that way you can exercise and
avoid a bigger problem now if you want
more information about determining your
recovery i put that video up right here

so I want to talk about the relationship between cortisol and protein a lot of
people don't understand this but there's a huge connection with cortisol the
stress hormone and the breakdown of protein in the body so I want to kind of
show you kind of us and some overall reviews of what happens protein breaks
down into amino acids and if you know there's a lot of people right now with
they have a lot of neurotransmitter problems they have depression they have
attention deficit disorder they have anxiety and they're trying to take psych
drugs to improve the neurotransmitters right my question is why why can't they
get it from the diet what's what's the problem what's causing this amino acid
issue a lot of hormones are made from amino acids why do people have hormone
problems why does your immune systems so bad why do they have bone loss and
muscle loss that's called atrophied muscle loss so
there's a couple things that allow this process to occur when you consume
protein to make amino acids and turn them into body tissue and
neurotransmitters one is you need enzymes from the pancreas so let's say
the person is a diabetic or they've eaten a lot of sugar and they damaged
the pancreas that could be one big factor that they're not breaking down
into the amino acids to be able to make these neurotransmitters anymore it could
be also they're eating all cooked foods you know it could be dietary it could be
that they're not consuming enough protein I didn't even put that on there
but that's kind of rare or it could be the stomach they don't have enough
hydrochloric acid and they have heartburn and they have digestive
problems and they're taking any acids or whatever that could be the reason why
they're not getting these as well digestive problems or could be lower in
the digestive tract they don't have the friendly bacteria to really break down
these proteins as well because that is something not only the stomach but the
microbes help you make amino acids as well okay the number one thing though is
the high cortisol that's really what will prevent this process from occurring
and this comes from stress so cortisol creates a catabolic effect
comes from the word cannibalistic cannibal cannibal eats eats flesh okay
catabolic hormones break down things we break down muscle protein so with the
cortisol this high stress these amino acids are not absorbed in the muscle so
you get a catabolic effect of the muscle you get breakdown atrophy of the muscle
you get muscle wasting with cortisol that's why during stress or menopause
when the adrenal backs up the ovary you see is people just like getting all
flabby so that's atrophy of the muscle amino
acids do not get absorbed into the muscle if the hot cortisol is high the
bone is not just calcium it's a lot of collagen it's a lot of protein so the
bone also doesn't get the amino acids too so you have bone loss okay but third
the lymph system the lymphatic the lymph nodes that's part of the immune system
it actually shrinks in an atrophies as well call is called lysis which is
breaks down the limp breaks down and what happens is it releases antibodies
and I want to get into that and a little bit but first let me just kind of tell
you what happens so we have the suffering of all the body tissues
involved with protein muscle tendon ligament bone lymph all these things
don't get the proper amino acids so now what happens as these amino acids go
instead to the liver and they go through a process called daemon d animation okay
D emanation and this basically is a term of breakdown of amino acids and so in
other words the liver will break down these amino acids into ammonia and
carbon skeletons and the Hydra the hydrogen ion okay so the ammonia turns
into urea or urine or uric acid and that's why people get gout because
they can't this builds up too much because the liver is damaged okay
or the kidneys damaged but carbon skeleton forms carbohydrates and glucose
in other words your body is converting amino acid to sugar to glucose yeah
that's interesting the hydrogen ion that gets that goes out to the urine and
wherever the hydrogen ion goes so does the potassium so you lose potassium and
then when you lose potassium you become very very alkaline and it throws off the
pH and you can't absorb oh my gosh calcium II of all these issues all right
why why is the body doing all this because it's in a survival mode it must
create a secondary fuel source and what it does is it causes gluconeogenesis
gluco meaning sugar neo New Genesis create so the body is creating new sugar
from protein from amino acids so it'll basically allow the rest of the body to
go to hell in a handbasket as long as it's good it gets its fuel so
but the problem is all this carbon atoms that it's kind of pulling carbon
skeletons it's forming glucose will start spiking the blood sugar and
spiking the insulin and causing diabetes and belly fat and high cholesterol okay
now there's some other things that I want to talk about with this limp when
you release the antibodies you also then with a smaller lymph system start
decreasing the production of antibodies you don't actually produce these
antibodies like you did before and you also do not create the cellular barriers
in the resistance and is against infections so you have a lowered
resistance and a susceptibility factor and that's what causes the autoimmune
disease autoimmune diseases are the loss of tolerance or to differentiate from
Invader a healthy tissue self and non-self okay so your body starts
attacking itself that's what it autoimmune thing is and if you ask any
person who had autoimmune diseases when did it start it always happened
after a stress event or a loss of a loved one or a divorce and they start
getting this because it stresses the core soul cortisol is the main source of
problems with autoimmune diseases why because it's used is the main here or
not cure but treatment what should they give all autoimmune disease they inject
them with prednisone cortisol but they don't take it back and look at what
happened first the first thing is that there's a process bicon cortisol and
there's this whole reaction that occurs you lose your lymphatic system your
immune system your antibodies go out of control and you become susceptible and
then boom you start getting a loss of tolerance to other tissues so there's a
delicate balance of your body determining what's a good cell what's a
bad cell with a good microbe with a bad friendly bacteria unfriendly and when it
loses control start surveilling developing autoimmune diseases now let
me just touch on this I mentioned antibodies right and anybody is a Y
shape protein that is used to neutralize invading viruses and bacteria okay so
basically the antibodies help neutralize attackers they basically tag or label
some foreign microbe as an illegal alien that must be removed from the system so
the other parts of the immune system can go in there and take over and remove it
but it also can attack it directly and neutralize it directly in some
situations but that point is that these antibodies when they lose control right
here then you lose your you become susceptible to getting all sorts of
chronic infections and autoimmune diseases
some interesting things about autoimmune diseases they're traded with cortisol we
talked about that and they turn off when you're pregnant
that's fascinating so there is a mechanism that protects this growing
fetus from being destroyed by your immune system and apparently when you're
pregnant your immune system wakes up and all your
autoimmune problems disappear which is fascinating so we have a solution we
need to improve the immune system not try to attack it with steroids or we can
actually just recommend that the pregnant female stay pregnant and have
about 13 14 20 kids and then she'll be great through those years okay that's
another option transplanting organs they have to take cortisone because they have
their body rejects it they develop antibodies against him cortisol is an
anti-allergic function of properties but always autoimmune problems are always
triggered by stress events I've never met anyone that didn't have that
situation so that kind of debugs why people have autoimmune but cortisol
is a very very very destructive thing to your protein if it's in high amounts so
we want to apply the adrenal protocol for any of these issues right here to
strengthen the actual adrenal one last little tidbit right here calcium is loss
of the urine with high levels of cortisol to loss of the bone - so the
calcium absorption is decreased through the blocking of the vitamin d receptor
now what does that mean that means when you go through high levels of stress
your vitamin D goes down because it blocks the receptor so you can't absorb
vitamin D anymore and there's a lot of people that get Sun and I still have low
a lot of people have low vitamin D they don't know why the doctors don't tell
them it's probably because of high cortisol
okay so cortisol decreases the receptor thereby blocking be receiving a vitamin
D and this is intimately connected to the immune system because vitamin D one
function is not just bone or calcium metabolism it's immune protection

so someone had a question about what is that growling sound in my stomach
is that just hunger pains what actually is it you may have these sounds when
you're hungry but the hunger is not the thing that's
causing it okay the thing that's causing it is
something called migrating motor complex now what the heck is that
that is a certain housekeeping condition in your body where it's
cleaning out the debris the extra food particles and there's
certain waves of peristalsis or a pumping action of
debris going through the small intestine and
into the large colon why is that so important because
one really important function of this is to prevent
sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth a lot of people by the way
have this condition they don't even know it
and that condition is when you have too much bacteria in your small intestine
the majority should be in the large intestine when the bacteria
gets into the small intestine it starts robbing you of nutrients fat
soluble vitamins but like vitamin a vitamin d potassium vitamin c
zinc and it leaves you deficient not only that
you start getting fermenting of vegetables and other fibers that get in
here and you start experiencing a lot of
bloating so if you consume like vegetables or fiber or even
probiotics and you feel worse you could have sibo going on right here
because this mechanism is not working it's not pushing things
through and when you have sibo you have a lot of growling going on a lot of
sounds going on there because your body is trying to clean it out
but it can't okay so let's talk about what would you do to stop the growling
well it'll stop by eating but of course if you have sibo you know
if you eat it's gonna you might even feel more bloating
bile salts are antibacterial they kill bacteria and usually
people that have sibo are very deficient in
bile i mean think about it right the gallbladder is releasing bile into the
small intestine and the bile goes through the small
intestine and very little of it ends up in the large
intestine most of it gets absorbed in the small intestine and
gets recycled and if you have sibo you're going to
produce less bile to then kill off the microbes
by taking purified bile salts it'll greatly help
get rid of sibo also it'll help stop the growling sounds
and by getting rid of sibo your body will make more bile
lowering stress will help diminish the growling sounds
fixing the sibo by taking bile as well as betaine hydrochloride fixing the
stomach acid as well that will help both of those last thing and this is
very important is to start doing intermittent fasting
and give it some time to work because this mechanism right here kicks in
between 90 minutes and three hours so if you're eating too frequently you'll
never give this system a chance to kick in and
do its work so the more you do intermittent fasting
the more you'll be able to clean this out and the less growling you're going
to have because you're going to start to have
more bile to actually make sure that this bacteria doesn't
stay in there and the fact that eating stops
this process so you want to go for a good amount of time
without eating to allow your body to clean out the debris
by going 16 17 18 hours of fasting so it can do its house
cleaning if you want some more information about bile salts i put a
video right here check it out

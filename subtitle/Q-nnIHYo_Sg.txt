now i've definitely done a lot of videos on zinc and the importance of zinc for your immune system
for ulcers for increasing testosterone but one of the problems that occurs when you're taking
too much zinc over a longer period of time let's say you're taking over 40 milligrams which isn't
a significant amount but it's like four times more than the recommended amount over a period of weeks
could potentially create a copper deficiency so i just want to bring this to your attention
if you start experiencing certain symptoms then you kind of know what might be happening
because zinc and copper work together in fact they compete for absorption in the small intestine so
if there's too much zinc to copper or just zinc you're not going to get the copper you can create
a copper deficiency so it's always good when you're taking zinc to also take copper and i just
recommend taking all the trace minerals together with zinc i'll put a link down below of what
i recommend on that but let's go ahead and talk about the symptoms that can occur when you have a
copper deficiency by taking too much zinc number one nausea okay so if you start feeling nauseous
after taking a lot of zinc then you know what's happening number two flu-like symptoms because
one of the things that occurs with a copper deficiency is something called lutropenia which
is a lord amount of white blood cells all right number three anemia so you're gonna feel weak
and tired number four stomach pain number five tingling and numbness in your hands or feet number
six diarrhea number seven a loss of skin tone because copper is necessary for collagen so if you
start noticing that your skin starts looking loose that could be why number eight vomiting so those
are all the symptoms of a copper deficiency just to bring your awareness up of a potential problem
when you take too much zinc thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

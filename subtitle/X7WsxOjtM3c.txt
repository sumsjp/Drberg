hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video I want to talk about why your exercise is not
working if you're putting effort out and you're not seeing the results it is because of this one
thing right here your sleep sucks alright your sleep is either you're not getting enough sleep
or the quality of sleep is bad all of the benefit from exercise occurs when you are sleeping so if
you're not getting at least seven to seven and a half to eight hours of high-quality sleep
and waking up refreshed you're just putting your exercise benefits down the drain because
poor sleep destroys your metabolism and it also destroys your ability to recover from
exercise it's much more important to focus on your sleep than it means to even exercise if
you're trying to lose weight so I want to show you a little technique okay this is my massage
tool it's used for different sizes for different things okay you can do it on your neck and your
body but there's two points and they're over the adrenal points I want to show you so we have the
rib cage right here right we have the sternum and the rib cage right here your Drina 'ls are
on top of the kidney lay deep inside there the two acupressure points you want to use
you can even use it end of a brush to do this if you don't have a massage tool I just don't
use like a machete when you do this okay so you take the tool and you press right underneath your
rib cage see I'm right in there and you would do it with the massage tool and you press in
there just enough to feel a little tension not too much and you're going to hold that for like
one to two minutes before you go to bed don't do it right now and then you're going to do the
other side right over the acupressure point to the adrenal okay now it's about 1 inches down
from you rub your rib cage off of an inch off the midline to the right and then to the left and the
right you do one at a time and you would press and do this okay there's a whole technique on it
but I'm just showing you the sleep point which over the adrenal and you press in there and you
hold it I will promise you by the time you do that you're going to kind of drift and you're going to feel a little tired and start yawning
because it relaxes a person if you think about adrenal stress which is the number one reason why
key people can't sleep and where the person has their energy stuck and stored it's in the over
the adrenal areas because adrenals are working hard hard hard the problem with the adrenal it
doesn't have an off switch it has to manually be turned off so an acupressure technique can press
on that and you're going to feel very relaxed and you're going to drift off into a nice sleep
so go ahead and try this and put your comments below thanks for watching hey guys thank you so

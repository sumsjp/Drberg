we're going to talk about what to do if you have sleep apnea
so if you have sleep apnea i recommend taking garlic before
bed and here is why garlic has amazing properties
but before we get into those the type of garlic you want to take if you were
going to chew some garlic that might irritate your
stomach so you may want to try maybe garlic in a pill form maybe you
get a freeze-dried garlic or black garlic i think that might be
easier on your stomach but garlic can actually help someone
sleep through lowering their blood pressure for
example that would be one thing it's going to relax
the body it's an analgesic so it can decrease
pain try to sleep if you're in pain but as far as sleep apnea goes taking
garlic can help shrink some of the swollen areas because
garlic is naturally an anti-inflammatory it can also
help kill off fungus or yeast in the sinuses so that's going to help
open the nasal passages so you can actually breathe better
and you'll find that you'll snore less also garlic will help
the lungs it'll help you breathe better also if there's any type of hidden
infection going in your body a lot of people have that by the way they might
have like an epstein-barr virus or h pylori
or even candida garlic can is an anti-microbial help to
put that back in remission and if there's less infection there's
going to be less cortisol and that is also going to be
another factor to help reduce the swelling around the uh the
back of the throat and lastly garlic is great for your
circulation so you're just going to it's going to help put you in a relaxed
state it's going to help more blood flow and hopefully minimize some of these
side effects from sleep apnea before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not
going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to

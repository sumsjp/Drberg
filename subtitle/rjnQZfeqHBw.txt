hey guys dr. Berg here listen I had another question related to intermittent fasting without
keto ok so some people say should I do can I do intermittent fasting and not do the whole
keto thing ok well the question is what are you going to replace it with usually higher
carbohydrates ok so there's no doubt that you may drop some weight because you're going to
drop insulin on intermittent fasting that's true but you may not because if you add more
carbohydrates that can nullify the effect of intermittent fasting there's two situations going on
you have one is weight loss and that has to do with dropping insulin ok you could also drop
insulin unhealthily and end up with a lot of other problems so then we have getting healthy
providing nutrients the quality of calories are they nutrient-dense are you eating empty calories
that's why I always recommend doing keto with a lot of vegetables right to get the nutrients
in there but yeah if you go to you know Wendy's or McDonald's and you're you're doing that once
a day and you're considering you're doing this healthy program even if wouldn't nutritional
deficiencies so you may lose weight but not look very good your skin your hair your nails
will all not look good and I see people that actually try to lose weight unhealthy and they
just look older they look ragged and then you have the toxic effect of foods you have the GMO
the pesticides and the foods like glyphosate which is Roundup Ready and many of the foods
that are in the grocery store chemicals that are estrogen mimickers msg you know and then
you have just genetically modified foods in general not to mention all the nitrates and
all the other things that are in the food which then can create set you up for cancer in other
diseases so when you're doing in a minute fasting that is one tool ketogenic is another tool so you
want to get the best of both worlds you want to use intermittent fasting as a tool to drop
insulin but ketogenic if done correctly can be very healthy too so just because someone's on an
intermittent fasting program doesn't mean that they're necessarily doing it healthy
all right put your comments below and let me know what you think hey you probably already

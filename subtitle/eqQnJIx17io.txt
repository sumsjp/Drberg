so the question today is why would you want to use lemon juice and apple cider
vinegar for your liver let's talk about it the key element or factor in apple
cider vinegar is not the vitamins and minerals and apple cider vinegar
it's the acetic acid so as far as the quality goes and up cider vinegar you
get something that's organic you can get Bragg's there's other organic versions
but commercial opposite of vinegar has sometimes pesticides in it so just get
some in its quality okay what does acetic acid do it helps suppress fat
storage now why does it prevent a person from storing fat mainly what it does to
your blood sugars it actually improves insulin sensitivity it makes insulin
more sensitive which means it reduces insulin resistance which means it will
reduce insulin okay and anything that does that will help prevent the storage
of fat and stabilize your blood sugars and reduces fat on the liver because
fatty liver comes from high levels of insulin but the real big benefit for
outside of vinegar is this it speeds up digestion okay it helps you release bile
from your liver it helps the pancreas release enzymes so let's say for example
you ate a meal and you feel bloated or you have indigestion you want to take
apple cider vinegar it just helps to speed up with the digestive juices the
flow of fluids through your liver through the stomach through the small
intestine so if you have any doubts try it yourself and you'll see that it will
work so these are the main key benefits of adding up soda vinegar to your diet
now let's shift over to lemon okay so you can do raw lemons or lemon juice in
a bottle just realize that if you're consuming lemon juice in a bottle it's
cooked it's pasteurized and anything that you heat you destroy enzymes and
you destroy certain vitamins you're going to greatly lower the vitamin C
when you do that there's other benefits to lemon juice that go beyond vitamin C
but you're not going to get a lot of vitamin C if you're getting it from a
bottle and as a side note if you're gonna get lemon juice in a bottle make
sure you get an organic version not the one that you usually get at the grocery
store that has the preservatives get something just with
lemon juice and water so there's several benefits of lemon juice one is if it's
raw you're getting a lot of good vitamin C
so vitamin C is very very important especially to the liver
it's a powerful antioxidant and there's a lot of oxidation and free radical
damage going on the liver so vitamin C is very important in reducing that
oxidative effect that happens in the liver vitamin C also will increase
glutathione which is a another powerful antioxidant in the body especially in
your liver and even now glutathione is not made inside the mitochondria the
little energy factories it's used by the mitochondria as a very important
antioxidant and you should probably check out some of the videos I have on
the mitochondria I put a link down below on that topic alright next thing lemon
juice protects against liver damage lemon juice has a lot of phytonutrients
not just vitamins and certain minerals these phytonutrients are very necessary
in protecting the cells against all the chemicals that are involved I mean think
about it your liver is the main organ to detoxify poisons and chemicals and it
needs antioxidants not just the ones that your body makes but you need them
from the diet as well and lemons provide a good source of antioxidants and citric
acid decreases oxalates okay and oxalates actually can form kidney stones
they can actually form crystals that cause pain in certain parts of the body
and citric acid helps prevent those and this is one of the reasons why if you're
doing keto and then fasting this is this would be a really good drink to consume
for the benefits of apple cider vinegar and also the benefits to reduce oxalates
and one more benefit that lemon has is its anti-inflammatory properties
when a person has a fatty liver their inflammation goes up and that can
develop all sorts of buildup of collagen as scar tissue which eventually turns
into cirrhosis so anything that reduces inflammation would be a good thing now
there's many different ways that you can consume this you can take apple cider
vinegar in a pill there's even lemon powder
what I do personally is I take between one and two ounces of lemon juice it's
usually two ounces and then I'll mix that with two tablespoons of apple cider
vinegar in about 16 ounces of water okay and I'll just drink that down I normally
like to consume this mixture after dinner maybe about 6 or 7 o'clock at
night some people like to take a smaller version and consume that before meals
it's really up to you you can test it out different ways and sometimes I'll
add a scoop of wheatgrass juice powder to this mixture which just adds more
nutrients and then there's other times that I consume my wheatgrass juice
powder by itself in water in the morning very early in about a 16-ounce jar so
I'll do that a little bit early in the day and I'll have this more in the
evening and this seems to really help digestion so as you doing in a minute
fasting to meals and one meal and you feel like you're just a little bit
stuffed or you feel a full sensation or bloating the combination of both of
these in some water can really help to enhance digestion and take the stress
off the liver all right guys thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge

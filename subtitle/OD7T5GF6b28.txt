osteoporosis is not a calcium deficiency problem so many people have in their
mind that if i have osteoporosis i need to start drinking a lot of milk
start taking calcium so they start taking like 500 milligrams
of calcium carbonate every day expecting
their osteoporosis to magically go away well there's some very
interesting data that talks about calcium supplementation
not only not helping you with osteoporosis
or reducing their fractures from osteoporosis
but increasing the risk for heart attacks
and even stroke and i'm going to put some links down below
one study talked about if you took 500 milligrams of calcium every day
it potentially could increase the risk of heart attacks by 30 percent
and risk of getting a stroke by 20 percent
now in a review from 2018 using the routine use of calcium and
vitamin d did not reduce the risk of osteoporotic
fractures but it did increase the risk of kidney
stones now the thing about calcium is that it's
very very tightly regulated so if you get too much calcium it
becomes very very toxic very similar to too much iron or too
much copper versus other minerals like
magnesium or potassium you can get a lot of that and your body
will get rid of it but not calcium too much calcium is very
toxic to your cells and if you look at certain health
conditions as people get older they're just filling up with toxic
calcium extra calcium that lodges in their arteries in the joints
thirty percent of the population in the u.s has
calcification in the arteries and there's a really good test
uh that you can take i'll put a link down below and it's called coronary
artery calcification test so that's a very very good test to predict
overall mortality too much calcium could lead to all sorts
of problems there's one condition i want to make you aware of milk alkali
syndrome this is a condition where the person is
consuming too much calcium and it could be from
drinking too much milk or taking an antacid
here are the side effects kidney failure death psychosis confusion
dizziness poor appetite and the list goes on and on and on
so what i recommend is you get your calcium from your food as much as
possible and never take calcium carbonate because
your body is a heck of a time absorbing that osteoporosis
is a severe loss of bone mass and density and bone is made from
protein minerals and calcium as well it's not
just calcium so it's the whole package osteopenia is
a lesser version of that and then osteomalacia is where the bones
become soft and in a child it's called rickets
and this is a vitamin d deficiency what's even more important
than calcium is your vitamin d level is your stress
level too much chronic stress or taking
steroids prednisone for example will destroy the
bones post menopausal women who go through a
lot of stress and go through a lot of menopause
with adrenal stress because now the adrenals have to back up the ovaries
sometimes develop osteoporosis from a combination
of higher levels of cortisol and lower levels of estrogen
so that can cause a loss of bone also if you have digestive issues malabsorption
can create a problem usually because you're not able to absorb
vitamin d and then you can't absorb calcium
vitamin d has a purpose of increasing calcium absorption by
20 times so without vitamin d you would have to consume 20 times
the quantity of calcium that doesn't make sense
vitamin k2 is another vitamin that is ignored this is like
vitally important vitamin k2 has a huge purpose
of making your bones very very strong and solid
to keep the calcium in the bone and keep it out of the arteries and the other
soft tissues so this right here is probably one of the
most important factors in dealing with someone with
osteoporosis the other thing that's been proven is that regular exercise can
greatly reduce the risk of osteoporosis you want to keep your stress low make
sure you get a lot of sun or you can take vitamin d3 k2
eat very healthy so you can get the minerals from the food
i mean one good source of calcium is leafy greens another source is some
high quality grass-fed organic cheese so in this video i just wanted to increase
your awareness that osteoporosis is not just a calcium
deficiency it's much more than that and i don't recommend taking high doses
of what they normally recommend calcium carbonate
because of this problem right here which i'll put some links down below

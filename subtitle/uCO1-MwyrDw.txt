let's talk about celery today what it can do for you
um there's not a lot of research on celery
some people might say well i'm gonna wait for the research to come out but
it's really pretty simple to do research on yourself
eat some celery see if it helps you that's your own
personal study right there but celery has been known to help people
with high blood pressure there are certain phytonutrients in
celery and i've recommended celery to a lot of people and it seems to work
pretty well here's one of the phytonutrients right
here but realize that this phytonutrient is in
the fiber part so if you're juicing the
celery and drinking the juice you may or may not get enough so if
someone were to have high blood pressure symptoms i would recommend just
consuming the entire celery versus the juice you can also get
celery seed extracts this is more concentrated in this phytonutrient right
here so there's a lot of benefits of celery
seed extract you can get that online or at the health food
store but consuming the entire stalks of celery
you're going to get most of benefits that you need with these right here
also celery can help you sleep at night so if you're going to consume
three to four stalks before bed not right before bed maybe
an hour or two before bed and will it kick you out of ketosis
just a little bit there's not a lot of calories in celery and also it's just
like mainly water some fiber which does not affect the
blood sugars and there's not a lot of sugar in celery
in fact it's very low on the glycemic index so of course you wouldn't want to
add peanut butter on it because that would add
more calories to it but it can help you relax
and help insomnia now there is higher amounts of sodium in celery but
it's nothing compared to what your daily recommendation is so it's not going to
be really off the charts celery also has
potassium it has a little bit of sodium but it's
not going to be a problem some people are concerned about
consuming celery because it has too much sodium you do not have to worry about
that because your body needs sodium but when you consume celery
especially before bed you wake up with less fluid retention
so if you have puffy ankles for example celery is a really good
diuretic not to mention other things in the celery other than just electrolytes
next point is celery is really good for inflammation
of your joints so it's a really good anti-inflammatory
especially for gout arthritis which is right
here so there's another phytonutrient that helps lower uric acid
not to mention celery is alkaline so it can help alkalize the body and
when you alkalize the body what happens the gout symptoms reduce greatly so no
longer you're getting these deposits of uric acid crystals just by changing
the ph and alkalizing your body that shuts off
so i really recommend celery about three to four stalks a day now celery is
also good for UTIs urinary tract infections
celery also contains a phytonutrient called
apigenin which is i've talked about this in my summit
it's a really powerful anti-cancer phytonutrient it's also in
parsley and some other vegetables as well
and as the last point i want to bring up if you have gout
even though apple cider vinegar is acidic this also seems to be
good for gout thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto

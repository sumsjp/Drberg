today we're going to talk about how to reverse a condition called acanthosis nigricans okay now
what is that that's a situation where you have this gray brown hyperpigmentation it's kind of
a darkening on the back of your neck on the side of the neck on the armpits it could be in certain
other places but it has a kind of a velvety texture to it and it's symmetrical which means
it's on both sides okay or both armpits now it's associated with diabetes pcos polycystic ovarian
syndrome cushing's syndrome which is high cortisol and metabolic disease okay now if you look it
up in wikipedia it'll say that the majority of cases are idiopathic this is a very fancy word
for i don't know what's causing it okay unknown cause but this condition is primarily caused by
excessive amount of insulin okay hyper insulin anemia too much insulin in the blood
and parallel with that you have insulin resistance so these go hand in hand
if you have insulin resistance your body will then make more insulin so you're going to have too much
insulin and that's what's creating this right here and that's why it's associated with diabetes pcos
cushing's and metabolic syndrome you can call it disease if you want but this is what's behind all
these right here now if you look at what wikipedia says about hyperinsulinemia what causes that
it lists tumor carb malabsorption which i'm not sure exactly what that means pancreatic cancer
pcos trans fats what are they missing they're missing the primary cause okay
eating too many carbs i find it very very interesting that the actual root cause
of hyperinsulinemia is not even on the page and so when people read this or study this
they're going to go oh maybe i should go to the doctor and get a mri or a cat scan and make sure
i don't have a tumor or maybe i should go to a gi doctor to see if i have carb malabsorption
or maybe an oncologist to see if i have pancreatic cancer or a fertility doctor to see if i have pcos
and so you have all these different specialists which have their own specialized knowledge
but unfortunately a lot of times they don't look at the whole picture and the common thread that is
throughout all of these conditions right here and this is it right here so very simply what
you need to do if you have this condition is lower the amount of carbs in your diet that's
really all you need to do and it will reverse this right here very very a to b give it a shot

today we're going to talk about how to actually protect your brain
against stress here's the problem stress shrinks your brain
it causes the brain to experience atrophy
especially in the hippocampus which you nearly always see when
someone has alzheimer's now fortunately there's
two parts of your brain that have the capacity to regenerate
only two not the whole brain and it just so happens that the hippocampus is one
of them thank goodness and then you also have
the olfactory bulb which has to do with smelling and the
differentiation of smelling one thing versus another
the hippocampus is a structure that they're still debating
as far as the function there's a lot of theories on what it does
but it has something to do with affecting short-term memory
like some type of mechanism related to a relay switch
to tap into your database of certain memories
but mainly short term not the long term also
it can affect your ability to learn it can also affect your ability to be
orientated so if you have damage with your
hippocampus you're disoriented and that has a lot to do
with this right here navigation because the hippocampus is
involved with your ability to navigate through space
so if you were in a city for example and you had a map and you had to get out of
the city if you had damage in your hippocampus
you would have a difficult time navigating through this space and also
remembering where you were in space so you're definitely gonna have problems
to find out where you parked your car and you see that with alzheimer's it
just so happens that 80 of alzheimer's patients also have type 2
diabetes symptoms so it's not only the stress that can
shrink the brain but also high sugar glucose
carbs can also shrink the brain but what i want to talk about is what can you do
about this how can you protect the brain because everyone goes through stress and
so you want to do these things right here six things
make sure on a regular basis you're taking b1 i recommend nutritional yeast
as a good source not the kind that has the added enriched
fortified synthetic b vitamins but the one that's unfortified
unenriched you know nutritional yeast because you want the b1 b1 uh greatly
improves the hippocampus in fact if someone's an alcoholic for example and
they become b1 deficient they have problems with this and they
start getting dementia so there's all sorts of conditions that
occur when you're deficient in b1 affecting the hippocampus
this will reduce stress number two dha and epa
both of these together are omega-3 fatty acids
so whether you're doing fish oil or especially cod liver oil
or getting it from algae dha epa can help prevent the brain from
shrinking and i'm going to put some links down below
of the research that i'm basing this off of so you need omega-3 fatty acids
why because part of the brain is made from
these healthy fats number three zinc there's a lot of receptors
in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus for
zinc if you lose your sense of smell that could be one symptom of a zinc
deficiency so zinc not only affects this but this
too so shellfish is really good to get your zinc also you can take it as a
supplement zinc does a lot it helps your immune
system it helps keep testosterone in normal levels and then we get to
number four which is fasting fasting creates a very
interesting effect on the hippocampus and the olfactory
bulb it actually increases something called
brain derived neurotrophic factor which is miracle
growth for your brain so when you fast you grow
your brain cells back fascinating number five
of course keto low carb healthy keto ketones are
wonderful for your brain your brain loves ketones they're anti-inflammatory
they can feed the neurons even if there's damage
and difficulty of your brain cells getting glucose
so ketones bypass the whole thing and feed the brain and help to keep it
nourished and number six is exercise which can
also help slow down or prevent shrinkage of the
brain probably because you're flooding the brain with
all sorts of powerful chemicals as well as
oxygen okay so you're gonna get a lot of oxygen too and there's other things you
can do too like the hyperbaric oxygen therapy and uh
using different types of exercise which i've done videos on but these are the
most important things to implement um just to
make sure that you can maintain a normal size of your brain all right
thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not
going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the u.s
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

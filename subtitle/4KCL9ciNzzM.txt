i want to talk about the risks of working night shift this is a major problem in
depriving of sleep especially if you're doing rotational shifts and it's not consistent
this could put a serious dent into your health so let's go through all the potential problems
when doing a night shift and depriving yourself of your normal circadian rhythms
now there is a way to minimize damage control which i'll get into but first let's talk about
the negatives all right number one it can increase the risk of depression dementia gi inflammation
headaches sexual dysfunction it increases the risk of metabolic syndrome which is
blood pressure blood sugar issues cholesterol issues and central obesity which is belly fat
and also this is classified or categorized as a carcinogen why because you're going
to have less melatonin and melatonin is a tumor suppressor now in women it can increase the risk
of getting breast cancer by 48 now in a study involving nurses there was a risk of heart related
deaths by 9% and nurses that do night shifts are 25% more likely to die from lung cancer
and women who do night shift work over five years have a shorter life span and over 15
years have an increased risk of heart disease by 38 percent now as far as diabetes goes there's a
pretty significant risk 36 percent if you're doing night shift work greater than eight times per
month which i think most people are doing there's also 28 published studies that show at least a 28%
increased risk of becoming obese or gaining weight so as you can see there's a lot of
problems with night shifts there's a couple points i want to bring up number one if at all possible
you don't want to do rotational night shift work you want to keep it consistent
and even the days that you have off you want to maintain that schedule and that's going
to significantly help you the other thing is the greater the stress on your body doing night shifts
the more closely you need to follow a healthy eating plan i'm talking about healthy keto and
intermittent fasting this will add a significant benefit in decreasing these risk factors
and also if at all possible keep your stress at a very low level simply because the stress of
not keeping your circadian rhythms consistent is very very high so if you're enjoying my content

let's talk about the food with the highest glyphosate
or roundup take a well guess what do you think it is
almonds yeah almonds now i think a lot of people have a confusion between this herbicide and gmo
when they make certain foods gmo like canola corn soy and cotton they resist this pesticide
now just because they resist the pesticide doesn't mean they're not going to spray this chemical on
that food because what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill off the weeds around that
plant and that's the only plant that lives but you're not resistant to glyphosate only the plant
is so you're going to be consuming this plant and you're going to be getting that in your body but
they spray this herb on other things too so the foods that are exposed the most would be almonds
then apples then apricots then asparagus and canola cherry corn cotton now you'd say well
i don't eat cotton yeah but you put cotton on your body and also cotton is in tampons which
go inside the body dates grapes and soy now one of the big problems nowadays is that these weeds that
they're spraying to kill with this glyphosate are becoming also resistant to roundup so that means
they have to spray more and more and more so our bodies are becoming more exposed to this herbicide
what can you do about it well organic okay but this doesn't guarantee that it's going
to be completely free of this pesticide because there has been some tests done that showed that
just because it's organic doesn't mean it's 100 farmers market so we where you know the farmer and
you trust the farmer and they you know they don't spray that might be a better option if you're
around the farmer's market and also consuming a good amount of organic cruciferous in your diet to
help to eliminate the accumulation of this herbicides now here's the question
what's more important to do organic or to do low carb doing low carb is the most important thing
and then cleaning up the quality of those calories would be the second most important thing to do

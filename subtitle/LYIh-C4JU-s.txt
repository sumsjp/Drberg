hi guys in this video I want to talk
about why I love almond flour so much
first of all it's gluten-free you can
make cookies muffins bread keto bomb all
these things with it and it has a
glycemic index of less than one wheat
flour is like a glycemic index of 71
it's off the charts but check this out
if we compare almond flour to wheat
flour protein it has 22 G versus 10 G
for wheat carbs 19 versus 76 G so it's
like you're eating sugar fat it's high
in fat 56 G versus 8 G so we want that
fat uh fiber 10 and 2 G potassium
687 G of potassium here here you are
consuming all these vegetables but you
probably didn't realize just almond
flour will give you some potassium too
look it wheat has 149 milligram then we
have magnesium 279 milligram wheat only
has 25
calcium 216 wheat has 20 vitamin E
26 wheat has 8 if it's whole wheat and
0.1 if it's white bread okay so it's
basically no vitamin E so I highly
recommend uh use almond flour in some of
your recipes put your comments

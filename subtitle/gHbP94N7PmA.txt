hi guys in this video we're going to talk about flaxseed okay now yes it's true that
flax seeds have tons of omega-3 in fact it's probably one of the foods that has the highest
amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which are good for your brain the cardiovascular it's good
anti-inflammatory functions it has a lot of great fiber it has something called ligands and what is
ligands ligands are phytoestrogens what's a phytoestrogen basically it's it's something
that will actually help balance and give you the good estrogen that you need so ligands basically
help you balance estrogen it's great for a female especially to going through menopause
okay flax seeds also have a lot of vitamin b1 and they have a lot of copper and a lot
of minerals but here's the problem these flax seeds have enzyme inhibitors what's an enzyme an
enzyme is something that breaks something down so inhibitors are something that stops the breakdown
of flax seeds so when you consume these like in a some type of a muffin or whatever you'll find
that go right through you because they don't get digested and the purpose of that is if an
animal eats these seeds and it's not digested goes through the tract it can actually come out
the other end and be fertilized and grow as a flax eat some more in another location okay so that's
the purpose is to help their own survival of the plant so the question is what type of impact does
enzyme inhibitors have on eating flax seeds well basically it prevents the breakdown the digestion
the absorption of the minerals and the protein it just doesn't allow you to absorb it in your
body yes you can do flax oil you're going to get the benefit of that but unless you crush
them freshly and consume them you're going to get enzyme inhibitors okay so this is what I
recommend get some sprouted flax seeds and you can get an Amazon they have a really good I'll
put a link down below but you can buy these flax seeds sprouted flax seeds it's already
germinated or ready to be digested because they're sprouted and they're and they're digestible so
when something sprouts the enzyme inhibitors go bye-bye so you can start absorbing them okay and
you can put them on your you know your food your salad put it in a little shake your kale shake
there's a lot of different ways but there's a lot of good benefit especially for females
with flaxseed all right so go ahead and make your comments below and thank you for watching

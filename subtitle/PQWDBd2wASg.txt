this is cool information intermittent fasting could replace insulin for diabetics
type 2. now the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 diabetic
is in a type 1 diabetic they're lacking insulin okay so the cells in the pancreas called the beta
cells are not able to produce any more insulin so there's nothing to keep their blood sugars down
so they have massively high blood sugars so they're going to need insulin okay
in type 2 we have a different situation we have insulin resistance which initially makes the body
produce excessive amounts of insulin okay but it's not being effective it's not working because it's
being filtered by the receptors that are not able to pull it into the body so we have a situation
we have a lot of insulin in the body but it's actually not working okay and that's why the
blood sugars go high so there's two different mechanisms now in time when a type 2 diabetic
with insulin resistance progresses the beta cells in the pancreas start becoming exhausted
and we have a situation where that high insulin hyperinsulinemia becomes less and less and less
and less and to the point where they are now deficient in insulin as well
and so some of the type 2 diabetics will then be given insulin in addition to their other
medications now what is the problem with this the complications the side effects from high sugar
are very similar to the complications and side effects of high insulin so ideally if you're a
type 1 diabetic or a type 2 diabetic where you're on insulin the ideal situation is to take the
least amount possible because of all the problems that come with high levels of insulin like macro
and microvascular problems in other words there's problems in the arteries with circulation as well
as in the tiny blood vessels to the nervous system so you start getting neuropathies like diabetic
neuropathy you start losing sensation because the nerves are dying because they're not getting
the vascular supply so high sugar destroys uh circulation or blood vessels to nerves and this
happens in the eye happens in the kidney happens in arteries it happens in the brain and so there's
a lot of complications with insulin resistance high insulin and even low insulin because now we
you need to give the person more insulin to control the blood sugars and then also this
other hormone that opposes insulin that's being produced by the pancreas and it's called glucagon
so anytime we have um increase of insulin we're gonna have low glucagon any time insulin goes
down now glucagon goes up okay and there are a lot of side effects from higher levels of glucagon so
this video is about a very interesting case study with three patients now it's not a lot of patients
but it's a reflection of what i'm seeing out there in the community of people
who are insulin dependent type 2 diabetics because i've heard time and time and time again
if these patients start doing intermittent fasting and they start going on low carb they do very well
so this is what they found in this case study this case study demonstrated the effectiveness
of therapeutic fasting intermittent fasting this is fasting done on a regular basis
to reverse insulin resistance resulting in stopping insulin to control blood sugars
they're also able to lose significant weight in their midsection and also lower their a1c levels
now the most noteworthy outcome was the complete discontinuance of insulin in all three
patients now two of the patients were able to completely eliminate all their medications in
addition to insulin and one of the patients was able to eliminate three of the four
medications now this is very important information if you're a diabetic on insulin either a type 2
or type 1 the ideal situation it would be to take the least amount of insulin and you know the more
carbs you eat the more insulin units you need to take so it would make common sense to lower the
amount of carbohydrates and you can do that with intermittent fasting or going on keto and both of
these actions are going to greatly reduce the need for insulin so you can take less now when the need
for insulin goes down that's going to alter your blood sugar so definitely work with your doctor if
you're doing this don't do this by yourself but i see this date in the future becoming the norm
because it's so effective using intermittent fasting to help control your blood sugars
and the need for taking insulin now if you're new to my channel and you want more information on
exactly what to eat and how to do intermittent fasting i put the link down below check it out
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

so i wanted to create a video on parkinson's i have several others but this one specifically on
certain foods that you should be consuming if you have parkinson's or want to prevent parkinson's
disease which involves degeneration of certain neurons in the brain that make dopamine and then
you get a loss of memory you get confusion you get very rigid muscles and you're very stiff
everything is slowed down you get tremors and there's a lot of other symptoms so apparently
in the brain there is a protein called paris i'm not going to give you the long name and
the protein paris basically inhibits or stops the protective proteins these other proteins that are
supposed to protect the brain against oxidation so normally in the brain you have this whole
series of proteins that are supposed to protect the brain against certain degenerative diseases
well paris comes along and stops that protection from taking place so now we have this accelerated
oxidation accelerated inflammation accelerated degeneration of certain parts of the brain well
it just so happens there is another compound that can deactivate paris okay and that's called
pharnasol to allow these protective proteins to prevent things like parkinson's and other
degenerative brain diseases all right so number one farnesol is concentrated in berries okay
number two vegetables especially tomatoes number three certain herbs like lemongrass chamomile
rose and musk and it's also in an essential oil called citronella so those are the four categories
of things i would highly recommend you start to consume if you personally have parkinson's
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

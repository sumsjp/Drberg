so let's talk about wrinkles so many people um are applying all sorts of anti-aging creams
lotions cleansers to rub off all the dead skin to hopefully have this new skin be replenished but
let's first dive into exactly what happens as you age in relationship to what happens
with your skin so number one you have the loss of elastin fibers elastin is a protein
that helps to keep the tone of the skin there so for example if you were
to have some type of elastic protein that's overstretched that's what happens as you age
so you lose that rubber band effect okay number two you actually have an overall loss of collagen
not necessarily because you're not eating enough protein or collagen it's because of growth hormone
and that's the next one growth hormone has everything to do with preserving
proteins so as you lose growth hormone as you age you lose that capacity to make collagen now
also realize collagen needs vitamin c so you also need vitamin c from the diet a couple little side
things you need to know about vitamin c smoking blocks the absorption of vitamin c consuming sugar
will block your ability to absorb vitamin c as you age you'll have less retention of moisture
so the skin tends to dry out and so this is not necessarily just a matter of drinking more water
just the skin itself has less ability to retain that water all right and number six less able to
repair and there's a lot we can do about this as far as slowing down the process of repair
and regenerate because you need certain nutrients to help that repair action and
also you have the um too much damage from sun right take a look at any farmer that's out in
the sun for many many years i mean their their skin is like leather so too much overexposure
of uv radiation from the sun is going to majorly affect your skin also too much stress
right with cortisol cortisol is a catabolic hormone it tends to break down proteins
too much insulin as in too much sugar will oxidize and age your skin as well smoking i
already covered that there's a lot of oxidation a lot of premature aging going on and of course
alcohol your skin is not just your skin it's the reflection of your organs not just your liver but
the colon the stomach the gallbladder the whole thing the other point i want to bring up is
this cleansing process a lot of women are overdoing it with the cleansers okay so they're
scrubbing their skin they're sterilizing their skin by removing this layer of microbiome
that should be on the skin and so now it gets red it doesn't heal i'm going to recommend you
really focus on your diet okay this is something that's very very underestimated as far as putting
attention on it you want foods that are high in flavonoids carotenoids tocopherols these
are antioxidants in our foods vitamin a vitamin d and vitamin e these are fat soluble vitamins but
guess what you need a good liver and gallbladder so you can make enough bile to absorb these so one
very important uh point i want to bring up is it's not just about eating foods that are high in fat
like to give you these fat soluble nutrients it's being able to break down the fats with
bile having healthy gallbladder liver and then emulsifying these fats and then absorbing them so
if you don't have a gallbladder if you're missing bile that could be the reason why you're not
getting these key nutrients into the skin vitamin c is very very important we already mentioned that
manganese magnesium potassium selenium zinc are the minerals why do we need the minerals
for hydration as electrolytes as well as cofactors to help build up the proteins in your skin omega-3
fatty acids very very very vital and to act as an anti-inflammatory versus the omega-6 which i've
talked about a lot in my other videos so these are the foods that i would recommend consuming more of
bell peppers especially red ones okay because the red bell peppers have way more vitamin c
than the green bell peppers avocados are loaded with vital nutrients pomegranate seeds loaded with
a lot of things especially phytonutrients and it has one phytonutrient that helps support collagen
i actually love pomegranate seeds what a crest it's a type of cruciferous i did a video on this
that has some very unique properties to support skin health blueberries don't consume the dry
blueberries consume the organic blueberries that are not freeze-dried because they're lower in
sugars and have a lot of great properties for skin also make sure that you're consuming large salads
that are nutrient dense every single day and fatty meats fatty fish and seafood a couple additional
really important points make sure you're doing periodic prolonged fasting in addition to regular
intermittent fasting if you want really nice skin you need to be doing fasting fasting helps recycle
old damaged proteins so the more fasting you do the better your skin is going to be
keeping your exercise for circulation and also keep in your sleep so you can keep your course all
in check as well hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would

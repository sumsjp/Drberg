hey guys dr. Berg here I wanted to talk about vitamin b2 deficiencies it's a
very interesting vitamin riboflavin all right
so look at all the things that it can create painful red tongue chapped lips
cracked heels in the bottom of your heels you know people put tons of lotion
but that's really a b2 deficiency even the cracks in the corners of the mouth
are a b2 deficiency right they're also oily skin around the little part of your
nose right through here where the indentation is that's a b2 deficiency
bloodshot eyes irritation to light watery eyes itchy eyes that's a b2
deficiency high histamines that could be anything with like itis or like
inflammation or all the type of dermatitis inflammation of the skin and
the joints of the eyes that's a b2 deficiency sinuses sneezing things like

deficiency anal fissures okay so in your private parts that could be very painful
so the question is how do you become deficient in b2 right well mainly b2 is
in it's in a lot of foods but it's usually coming because the person is
consuming too many grains or flour products and the breads pasta cereal
crackers biscuits waffles pancakes things like that because if you look at
the flour that they use to make that it's always well not always sometimes
it's enriched with synthetic vitamins including synthetic b2 that's not the
kind that you need so you just really have to cut out the refined wheat
products in other grains and doesn't matter if it's gluten free or not you
just need to avoid it it's just not good for you the other thing you could do to
to supplement it it's in nutritional yeast not Brewers yeast not baking

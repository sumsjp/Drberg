all right so today we're going to talk about this very unique type of zinc called zinc l-carnosine
okay for gut inflammation and gut disorders this zinc complex is significantly better than
any other forms of zinc for gut inflammation it even works better than if you were to take
zinc and l-carnosine separately okay so you'd want to take it as one supplement it gives you
major anti-inflammatory effects of the gut now people normally take l-carnosine for the heart
for the brain for your nerves for your eyes to help counter the side effects from diabetes but
zinc l-carnosine works very specifically to support the mucous barrier of your gut okay
because if you lose that mucous barrier then microbes can invade into your lymphatic system
and cross that barrier and create all sorts of immune reactions so zinc l-carnosine can
really help you support this mucous barrier of your gut it also is very very powerful
for gut ulcers stomach ulcers ulcers in your duodenum anywhere in your digestive tract
why because it increases the wound healing it's a major healer of ulcers it's also good for gerd
gastroesophageal reflux disorder that's where the acid comes up through that valve
another thing it's good for is irritable bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome whatever you
want to call it anything inflammation in the gut this is the remedy that you want to take
it's also good for a leaky gut if you have permeability issues it's also good
for inflammation in your esophagus it's also good not just for inflammation in your small intestine
and the large bowel but your esophagus as well and lastly like i just said it can increase gi wound
healing and so if you have any inflammation in your gut this is the best remedy zinc l-carnosine

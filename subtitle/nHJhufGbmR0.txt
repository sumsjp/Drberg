hey guys I had a question about intermittent fasting and when to exercise okay so let's
just talk about this for a second you know the whole goal is to drain out the excess fat that
you have right other goals would be just to feel better and get fit but maybe mainly people want
to lose weight and so they'd start adding intermittent fasting ketosis and they start
adding these things typically the big mistake is adding too many things too fast in other words
trying to go to two meals a day run off the bat and exercising on top of it and they crash and
burn so I think the the ideal indicator to know if you're doing it right is how you feel when
you start to exercise and you actually go through it your legs heavy do you feel tired do you feel
like I can't go on or do you feel like you have to reserve it you can do it that's the best indicator
to know that you're being able to handle it as far as the timing goes I don't suggest if you're
doing cardio or interval interval training to do it early in the morning if you're going to
wait if you're in the fast period because you're going to deplete your glycogen Reserve and if
you're not ready for it you have to adapt to it you're going to feel you're going to get really
hungry okay and you're going to feel light-headed hypoglycemic type reaction so I always recommend
doing the exercise unless here really really fit just before the meal during the the eating period
okay between the first and second meal the first second and third meal or just like me I exercise
right after the the last meal of the day okay that's perfect because you have the glycogen
reserve you have the food there to satisfy so you have the energy to work out okay now this
is are you going to burn more fat verses here versus here there's a couple studies and you
can burn a little bit more fat if you workout in the evening because of the the sleep cycles okay
it's not that significant so but it's a little bit more some people need to add more protein
when they workout like they're not doing any any protein at all so when you workout you break down
your protein you're supposed to build up if you don't have the amino acids if you don't
have the protein there you can feel a little bit weird so you want you may want to adjust
the protein a little bit or even add a meal if you feel really kind of ravenously hungry and
you can't handle your just going too fast okay that's all so some people add creatine okay so
which is a it's a it's a supplement that you can add to improve recovery I like it it's good
if you want to actually improve your recovery if you're trying to maybe develop more muscle
mass you can add that and it doesn't necessarily have to be with the meal okay I hope that answered

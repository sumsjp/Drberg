so today i want to talk about why they named vitamin a
retinol now could it have something to do with the word retina well the answer is absolutely yes
so vitamin a the active form of vitamin a retinol has everything to do with supporting the retina
and the retina is this extension of your central nervous system your brain that's sticking
out of your skull deep in your eye and it has certain receptors that are sensitive to
light allowing you to see so vitamin a helps form this photosensitive pigment in the retina
it's called visual purple or rhodopsin and this pigment converts light into electrical signals
and one of the first symptoms of a vitamin a deficiency is loss of night vision so vitamin a
retinol helps you see in the dark so if you're driving at night and it's getting dark or it's
a rainy night and you're having a difficult time seeing that's a real good indication that you
may need some more vitamin a now vitamin a is also needed to decrease the risk of infection
it helps you support healthy mucous membranes and your sinuses and your lung in your intestines
another very common symptom of vitamin a deficiency is dry eyes it will also decrease the
symptoms and complications of measles now if you haven't seen my video on the sources of vitamin a
i put a link down below because this is very important you cannot get your required vitamin a
from vegetables vegetables provide the precursor for vitamin a which has to be converted but it's
only converted in a very small amount the best source of the active form of vitamin a retinol
is from cod liver oil one tablespoon will give you four thousand units of retinol and cod liver oil
also has vitamin d and two very important omega-3 fatty acids dha and epa i definitely
do not recommend taking the synthetic version of vitamin a called retinol palmitate that has
quite a few complications which also put down below anyway i wanted to keep this video short

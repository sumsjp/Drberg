so how does a woman become more fertile okay there's there's two things number one you have
to avoid things that interfere with the endocrine system and that would be avoiding something called
endocrine disruptors by consuming organic foods and staying away from pesticides insecticides
herbicides fungicides things like that i have a lot of information on that i'll put some links
down below but in this video we want to talk about what to take to enhance fertility whether you have
pcos endometriosis fibroids or some other condition which throws off your menstrual cycle
or you have repeated miscarriages or whatever it is the most important thing to do is healthy keto
because as you're going to find out when you have high levels of insulin okay so if you're
on a high carb diet the ovaries response to that is to increase more androgens okay
and then that disrupts the entire fertility so get unhealthy keto healthy keto is also going
to supply all the nutrients so let's start from number one something called l-methylfolate without
enough folate there's a lot of damage that can happen with your dna so folate protects the dna
especially when you get pregnant you don't want to have any type of mutations or damage
to the dna because the body is going to have a natural tendency to abort
okay so folate very important number two zinc zinc is very very important in making sure that the
egg matures properly from a small little follicle to a fertile egg and it just so happens that
sperm is loaded with zinc and so that zinc is essential to make sure that that egg survives
all right next point is selenium selenium is a powerful trace mineral it's an antioxidant it
has many different purposes one being decreasing the risk for a miscarriage also it supports the
fluid around the egg and so if there's any type of free radical damage or oxidation going on
it's going to protect that by soaking up those free radicals okay number four vitamin d vitamin
d supports the uterus it also supports the placenta and it decreases the risk of pcos okay
number five omega-3 that includes epa and dha now omega-3 supports something called a cervical mucus
and that has everything to do with making sure that the sperm survives once it hits the mucus so
it can travel through the mucous and get to where it needs to go omega-3 also keeps the uterus very
very healthy and prevents inflammation of the uterus all right number six b vitamins you can
get these from nutritional yeast but they're very essential in supporting the ovary health all right
number seven iron iron increases fertility what's interesting is iron also is needed by a plant
to increase its fertility all right number eight vitamin e vitamin e is known as the
fertile vitamin in both men and women so one of the things it will do it supports the cervical
mucus all right and then we have certain herbs number nine we're getting into the herbs now chase
barrier which is known to increase fertility it's been around for a very long time it also decreases
prolactin levels which increases your risk for infertility all right number 10 chasteberry that's
an extract that increases cervical mucus to support the sperm it also decreases pcos
it supports follicle development which actually then will turn into an egg and
just generally it improves the quality of the egg itself number 11 maca root
that supports the endocrine system in females all right number 12 we have white peony root
this supports fertility decreases risk for pcos decreases prolactin levels it will also
inhibit endometriosis and it also has something called aromatase which converts testosterone
to estrogen so if someone has pcos this would be really really good to take as well and number
thirteen this is a form of inositol called d-chiro-anasatol anosytol is essential for the
axis between the hypothalamus pituitary and the gonads so it can help a lot of female problems
including making insulin more sensitive and if you noticed throughout this entire video pcos is
a common thing that will make you infertile and it all has to do with keeping your insulin lower

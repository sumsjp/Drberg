so today we're going to talk about the benefits of being on a high fat diet one thing to realize is
that when you're fasting you are on a very high fat diet because your body is breaking down the
adipose tissue and turning it into fatty acids and then ketones so think about all the benefits
of fasting so initially when you fast you're going to quickly burn off your stored glycogen
in your liver when that's gone because you don't have a lot of that you're gonna then transition
right in to burning your fat and the majority of fuel from your fat cell is gonna be fatty acid
with about 40 being ketones and of course all the things i'm talking about will only exist
if you're also on a low carb diet because you never want to do high carb high fat that's
actually worse than being in a high carbohydrate low fat diet fyi because when you add either
protein to carbs or fat to carbs you really create more damage and i've done all the videos on that
topic but i'm not going to get sidetracked on that yet so when you increase more fat
in your diet and you keep your carbs low you're going to stimulate more bile production in more
bile release so right there that's going to help you prevent gall stones simply because gallstones
are a deficiency of bile all right number two you're going to provide for the raw material
of fat soluble vitamins vitamin a d e k 1 and k 2. you also provide for the omega-3 fatty acids dha
and epa which are very very important that's why they call them essential fatty acids
now just as a side note when you consume fiber your microbes in the large colon will ferment
this fiber into a type of fat that's very healthy for you it's called short chain fatty acids
and the name of one of them is called butyrate and the benefit of butyrate is anti-cancer
it can help you with blood sugars and insulin resistance it can also feed your colon cells
and there's quite a few other benefits all right number four medium chain triglycerides
medium chain triglycerides is a type of fat that can greatly help increase your energy because
it's converted into ketones and it doesn't need help from your gallbladder and the bile
it doesn't need help from your pancreas and the pancreatic enzymes it quickly turns into ketones
and it can give you energy and not only that it can feed the brain tissue and the heart tissue
despite even having damage in those two areas of your body all right number five dietary fat
in general will help increase your ability to make ketones ketones are made from your liver
ketones are the preferred fuel of the brain and your heart which i just kind of mentioned
ketones compared to glucose will increase your oxygen and also decrease your co2 so it provides a
more efficient fuel there's also less free radical damage from running your body on ketones than
there is from glucose glucose is very oxidizing it's very damaging to your tissues this is why a
diabetic for example has massive problems to the eye the heart the kidney and the nervous system
and lastly one really good benefit from consuming more fat is it gives you the raw material
for supplying necessary and essential compounds for all of your cell membranes
also many of your hormones including cortisol testosterone estrogen need fat as its precursor
you also need fat to help you make vitamin d as well as the production of bile the production
of bile and the production of vitamin d becomes a problem when you're on a low-fat diet all right so
i pretty much talked about the good things about being on a high-fat diet now let's talk about
the myths that are associated with the high fat diet and i put those up right here check them out

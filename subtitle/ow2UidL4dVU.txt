so this video I want to talk about why you should never consume raw chicken
meat now you may have eaten sushi which is raw fish or raw beef but not chicken
why because there's a certain bacteria in chicken and turkey that could
potentially give you food poisoning and then it's called Campylobacter bacteria
but 75% of all the chickens tested at the grocery store tested positive for
this bacterium this is the bacteria that loves to live inside of birds their
stomachs I'm talking chickens turkeys into some other birds as well and if you
consume enough of this bacteria you potentially could have severe diarrhea
flu symptoms fever severe abdominal pain cramping and even worse there's a
condition called guillain-barre a syndrome it's an autoimmune disease of
the nervous system the myelin sheath around the nerves and this disease 30%
of the time is caused by this bacteria antibiotics usually do not work they
don't kill this thing off so you're pretty much just managing your symptoms
you don't want to wash that chicken you want to stick it in the oven because you
could potentially get cross-contamination you start using the
hands and you're cutting and you're touching different things and the
cutting board now you can do that but you just have to make sure you clean
everything thoroughly with soap and water because all it takes is for you to
touch your mouth it gets in there and now we have a problem
you make sure that it's cooked at a hundred and sixty-five degrees
Fahrenheit now that bacteria will be destroyed at certain temperatures 48
degrees Celsius which is a hundred and eighteen point four degrees Fahrenheit
or you can kill it off by freezing it so you go to store bonnet chicken come home
stick your chicken in the freezer that will kill it most the time though if
your stomach has enough hydrochloric acid and you consume a moderate amount
of bacteria that acid hypothetically should kill off that bacterium but the
question is how many people have stomach acids many people especially as
they get older lose the stomach acids to a certain degree so they can't kill up
those microbes if you're on an acid we know you're not gonna have enough HCl
and your risk for getting this infection goes a lot higher now I know some of you
probably are never gonna check in there after watching this video I just want
you to realize that these figures are more for commercial chickens they don't
apply to chicken that you would get at the farmers market thanks for watching
and I did put another video on chicken that I think you'll find very
interesting I put it right here check it out

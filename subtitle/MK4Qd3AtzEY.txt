hey it's dr. Berg again in this video we're going to talk about calcium in
relationship to other functions most people associated calcium with just bone
building but calcium has some very important other functions that you need
to know about the number one function is it's involved in intracellular
communication the signalling of communication between cells it's a major
mineral that helps the cell communicate there is a condition that occurs when
you're deficient in calcium the body will start to increase the calcium
inside your cells okay so normally outside the cell you have 10,000 times
more calcium then inside the cell so we got this perfect Network balance of
calcium regulation in and outside of the cell okay so just a little bit of
disruption of that balance can create a lot of side effects but this condition
where you have low calcium yet high calcium inside the cell which is very
common is called intracellular hyper calcine osis now don't worry about that
name all it means is there's too much cell inside that too much calcium inside
that cell okay and that's because there's not enough outside of the cell
we'll get into what causes that but let's take a look at what occurs when
that happens you get hypertension you get Harding of the arteries why because
all that calcium cannot be mobilized now it's stuck in the body and so what do
people take when they have high blood pressure one form of hypertension
medication is called calcium channel blockers what do you think that does it
blocks calcium from going inside the cell okay and it actually helps lower
blood pressure but we got to look at the whole picture here because this
condition can also lead to diabetes because of the relationship between how
calcium affects the receptors for insulin okay so it can create diabetes
cancer now how can that occur well one thing that calcium does is it control
the reproduction of cellular growth in other words there's a term called
apoptosis which basically means normal cell death in your body if you have too
much cells that are growing out of control that's called cancer so you have
a mechanism in your body that controls the growth of cells and actually causing
cells to die in a good way just to keep them regulated well calcium is involved
in that so there's a problem with calcium you can get a situation where
it's it's out of control and then the cells are growing growing growing and the
cells can get bigger prostate cancer tumors and just regular cancer and I'm
going to share some links down below if you want to get the technical version of
this but inflammation is another symptom in soft tissue calcium that that's in
the artery I'm sorry in the joints as arthritis bursitis tendinitis kidney
stones gall stones plaquing on the arteries in the brain that's called
stroke so all these things can occur if there's too much calcium inside the cell
okay so now that's very interesting but what causes that well calcium doesn't
really move unless it has transport systems so you have certain vitamins and
certain things that help mobilize calcium number one vitamin D if the
person is low in vitamin D that can create this situation because they're
not absorbing the calcium here and then the body is going to compensate by
holding more calcium inside the cell low vitamin D levels right interesting but I
always want to know what causes low vitamin D levels because there's other
reasons other than not getting sun number one stress high levels of
cortisol it's a stress hormone can keep your vitamin D levels low which can
create this whole chain reaction so when people say these conditions can be
caused by stress they can but here's the chain of events that occur another thing
is low bio BI le that's the gist reduce from your liver that helps you absorb
certain fats and fat soluble vitamins vitamin D is a fat slab of item and so
if you have a gallbladder issue or a liver issue or let's say you're a
vegetarian you don't get a lot of saturated fats that help release it you
could be deficient in bio and get right shoulder pain bloating
digestive problems constipation well that is that means that you don't have
in a bile sure it's going to be hard to absorb vitamin D and it's going to hard
hard to regulate the calcium see that whole chain reaction there's another
vitamin called vitamin k2 I created a couple videos on this but vitamin k2 is
very very important to go lift go with vitamin K vitamin d3 because vitamin k2
not k1 regulates calcium it gets rid of soft tissue calcium it takes the calcium
from the cells and it drives it into the bone it helps make the arteries elastic
it's really good for osteoporosis it's really good for all these conditions so
vitamin k2 how can you become deficient well if you have a low fat diet because
guess where you get this in all the grass-fed fats animal front products
it's in some vegetarians called natto and things if you want to get that but the
point is that low fat diets and low foods low in grass-fed things like
grass-fed butter grass-fed beef if you're not eating those foods if you're
eating typical grain fed animal products you're not going to get k2 so that's a
very very common thing that people have low in these two and then they get this
situation right here now poor diet low Omega vitamin omega-3 fatty acids now
that's interesting because back in the 1920s vitamin I mean omega-3 was called
vitamin F vitamin F is another name for these unsaturated fats which basically
is omega-3 if you're low in vitamin o3 omega-3 you can have a problem with
calcium transportation as well and then low magnesium you get magnesium for
vegetables if you're not eating vegetables you might be low in magnesium
boom we get this excess calcium so I mean a lot of people take calcium
magnesium for these conditions right here but now you understand why it works
this is why it works now if you're taking also the wrong type of calcium
calcium carbonate that's limestone well guess what that can create the situation
too because it's not going to be absorbed and it can clog up all your
cells okay so you have to be able to
understand that that is not the best source of calcium just read the label
make sure it's not calcium carbonate the other thing is that if your digestive
system is bad you can't absorb mineral so that could be another reason but if
you look at why people take vitamin D vitamin k2 omega-3 and magnesium they
take those to help decrease inflammation they take it to improve the immune
system they take it for all these conditions but what they're really doing
is they're helping the regulation of calcium okay so I just wanted to give
you some insights on the importance of calcium and the danger of too much
calcium inside the cell and it has a lot more to do with not just the bone but
intra cellular communication

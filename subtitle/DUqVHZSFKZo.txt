so I want to talk about how to increase the diversity of your gut microbiome or
friendly bacteria now why would you want to do that because the more diversified
your microbes are the more benefit you're going to have with insulin
resistance weight loss reducing inflammation reducing allergies
strengthening your immune system and increasing the bioavailability of
nutrients so what are all the things that will increase the diversity of your
friendly bacteria number one feed them fiber as in vegetable fibers number two
having different types of vegetable fibers so if you're eating just the same
vegetable over and over and over you're not going to near have the
diversity that you should have so you want to rotate your vegetables you want
to have salad with a lot of different things that will help you also people
that are not overweight if you lose weight you'll have more diversity in
your gut versus someone that's overweight is gonna have less diversity
of microbes fasting very very powerful action to increase the diversity
apparently when you don't eat your microbes get stronger they live longer
and they develop in diverse ways also polyphenols okay this is a phytonutrient
that are in a lot of different foods nuts and seeds and vegetables and
berries so a wide variety of things but even like chocolate and coffee and of
course I'm not recommending chocolate or sugar but there are a lot of different
things that have polyphenol including wine so this is your time to start
drinking to increase your diversity of bacteria and I'm being very sarcastic
the problem with wine is the alcohol part and I'm not recommending that as an
option alright fermentation consuming fermented vegetables like sauerkraut is
very very good now check this out here are the things that will decrease the
diversity of bacteria in your gut snacking eating too frequently if you
overfeed your microbes you get less diversity all right sugar it will
decrease diversity antibiotics of course allowing the
bad bacteria to grow because one of the things that the good bacteria does is
they can they actually take up the space and the food so the bad bacteria cannot
live there are many many bad side effects that occur when you take
antibiotics one is waking alcohol will decrease the diversity GMO foods and I'm
talking about the main herbicide in GMO foods which is glyphosate that
apparently blocks microbes from producing amino acids and
neurotransmitters all right next one artificial sweeteners will also inhibit
the diversity of your microbes so if you don't have enough microbes that can also
affect insulin resistance and that can actually affect your blood sugars so
here you are not knowing this you start doing sugar free this sugar free that
using the traditional artificial sweeteners like aspartame and you're
gaining weight and you're wondering why okay being overweight we mentioned that
frequent eating we mentioned that and of course stress if you haven't seen my
other videos on the microbiome I put them up right here check it out

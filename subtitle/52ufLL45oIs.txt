plastic pollution has some good news and some bad news okay the bad news is that there's a
lot of plastic in our environment there's like a hundred million metric tons of plastic in our
environment and that was in 2016. i can't imagine what it is now in our oceans there's eight million
tons of plastic every single year that's dumped in our oceans mainly from several large rivers
that dump into the oceans and we all eat swallow and breathe 2000 tiny pieces of plastic every
single week that's 5 grams of plastic that is a credit card every single week that we're eating
not bad we get this plastic from our water shell fish salt and beer
but of course if you're on keto you don't have to worry about that beer now typically there's seven
different types of plastic okay and if you want to isolate what plastic is you look at the bottom
of your plastic water bottle whatever you have and you'll see this little triangle here and
it'll have a number one through seven and this one is number one which is pet which is polyethylene
pterophyllate which i could be butching the name but anyway it's a type of plastic okay so that is
the bad news there's some good news in japan in 2016 they identified a bacteria in other words
it releases an enzyme which is pet ace that can degrade plastics in other words it uses the carbon
from the plastic for its main energy source which is very interesting another company took this
bacteria and genetically modified it to break down plastic faster so it can degrade 90 of the plastic
within 10 hours incredible and so right now several companies are working on scaling up
to be able to do this on a very large scale so that is some good news there's also ocean
cleanup technologies which are becoming more popular whether they can isolate where the
plastic is on the planet and then they can concentrate it and extract it from the oceans
and lastly there are things that you can do to help detoxify plastics from the body
one thing you can take is it's called calcium d-glucarate which supports your detoxification
pathways and of course my favorite cruciferous vegetables if you consume these on a regular basis
you're going to increase your ability to get rid of not just plastics but heavy metals pesticides
other chemicals and poisons now also increasing sweating can help you get rid of some of these
plastics as well so regular exercise to the point where you're sweating will help you and lastly if
you don't already have a water filter a good one get one because the main source of this plastic
comes from tap water so you want a good water filter so you can block these particles of
plastics and so you don't have to keep ingesting plastic all day long all right thanks for watching
and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

hi guys Dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about enzymes now
what are enzymes enzymes are many little protein worker bees in your body they do
the work so you have carbohydrates proteins and fats and you have vitamins
and minerals and essential fatty acids and all these these raw materials but
it's the enzymes that manipulate the raw material to make things okay so first of
all when you eat it there's enzymes that are triggered by your the food that you
eat and it tells the pancreas what enzyme to release so there's very
specific enzymes for very specific foods and so when that enzyme is ready and
being pumped out by the time the food gets down there it breaks down that type
of food so you have protein protein enzymes fat enzymes carbohydrate enzymes
starch enzymes you have enzymes for breaking down the DNA you have enzymes
for collagen so you have a lot of different enzymes so the food is broken
down into small little particles okay so you have proteins are broken down into
amino acids fats into them into fatty acids carbohydrates into fiber and
glucose right so what happens is that now your body has to make enzymes to
build back up these small particles into new tissue so let's say you ate I don't know
you ate something like this right well this is going to be turning into
something in your body it's going to actually enzymes have to break it down
and then help replace some body tissue so what happens at the cellular level
you have this genetic blueprint it's called the DNA which basically is in the
instructions how to tell the little enzymes what to do okay so you have the
center of the cell which has the blueprints of DNA and you also have a
little copy machine inside the cell that's called the RNA so if the DNA and
the RNA so a copy is made it's translated it's interpreted and it's
shifted over into little mini factories inside the cell one is called the
ribosomes which is a little machine that makes
protein okay it turns amino acid into protein but it needs instructions and
enzymes are involved in these translation transport and there's a
second step enzymes actually are a second like a proofreader you have a
proofreader you have a copy machine you have blueprints and you have a
proofreader inside you cell so these enzymes scan all this code looking for
errors in the genetic code isn't it amazing
so therefore you're ending up with a perfect duplicate of what was originally
intended to for it to create the accuracy rate of this proofreading
mechanism is like one in a hundred million like the errors are less than
one in a hundred million and if there is a mistake the enzymes will correct it it
slices out a section and replaces it it's just fascinating so and then all
these amino acids that are broken down are sent into the factory to start
making body tissues okay and it does it with amino acids and fat and and and all
these processes need certain Co factors or coenzymes to make it all work and
that would be why we need vitamins like the B vitamins the fats I will buy does
vitamin A vitamin D the trace minerals minerals in general all those are needed
with the use of enzymes to get the job done and these chemical reactions so
enzymes also speed up the chemical reactions if you didn't have enzymes
it could take literally millions of years for things to get done with
certain types of enzymes and certain chemical reactions in the body you can
get things done that should normally would take a million years in two
milliseconds so they speed up the reactions of things okay enzymes can
recycle itself and that's what's fascinating they actually don't get used
up in the chemical reaction it's just amazing they actually get recycled
they're very efficient little guys drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors that's
how most drugs work they inhibit enzymes and
body so they block the enzyme reaction enzymes are triggered by pH changes so
there's a real strong protein enzyme in your stomach that has activated once
your pH gets between 1 and 3 which is very very battery acid it's really
strong and then that enzyme for approaching kicks in there it gets
released and you can start breaking down protein so if your stomach is not strong
enough especially as you age you don't have the acid
you're not going to release that protein enzyme therefore you're not going to
digest protein that well it's going to end up you're going to get a gas in
undigested protein and constipation and bloating and just by this fact that the
pH is incorrect that's why it's important to have the different parts of
your body the correct pH whether it's in the blood or it's in the gut if there's
all these different pHs so that's one of the purposes of having the correct pH is
that it activates enzymes hormones can activate enzymes too there's an enzyme
that burns fat called hormone sensitive lipase okay and that's activated by the
lack of insulin so when you don't have enough insulin or you have normal
insulin not too high that enzyme kicks in there and starts burning fat for you
so then you have enzymes it'll trigger by temperature so if you take for
example canned food what they do is they pasteurize it same thing they do with
orange juice and a lot of foods so it can sit on the shelf light because if
you have other food it goes bad quickly because enzymes anytime you cook food
you can help it last longer on the shelf right but the problem is when you
consume too many cook foods over a long period of time you can deplete your
enzyme reserves and end up with a lot of degenerative disorders okay so but some
of these enzymes can survive very very high heat there are enzymes produced by
microbes that can withstand the heat of lava I mean that's just amazing to me so
so temperatures can definitely affect certain enzymes we already talked about
vitamins and minerals and cofactors but what I wanted to mention to you is
that each vitamin complex in nature that comes with its own enzyme like vitamin C
complex it has ascorbic acid it has vitamin P which is bioflavonoids it has
vitamin J which is the anti pneumonia vitamin it has vitamin K which is for
clotting but it also has a an enzyme called tyrosinase which basically is
made is is made with a with a mineral trace mineral called copper so it's a
it's an enzyme form of copper that's used in the production of collagen okay
so that's why vitamin c is good for collagen and the adrenal glands store
vitamin c so enzymes are involved in a lot of different things C vitamins
wouldn't even work if you didn't have enzymes and enzymes wouldn't work if you
didn't have minerals so you really need the whole package so when we get into
nutrition really we need plant base minerals we don't want to take like
minerals from the earth like in soil like calcium carbonate a lot of the
minerals and synthetic vitamins are just like dead but if you have plant base
minerals and trace minerals and vitamins you do much more functional and when we
get into synthetic vitamins they're not very functional because they don't have
enzymes okay so enzymes are the magical worker that
makes everything work thanks for watching hey guys thank you so much for

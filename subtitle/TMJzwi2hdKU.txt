so there's been a lot of confusion when you start your keto
and intermittent fasting plan related to how many calories that you should be
eating and also the concept of don't eat unless
you're hungry do you just go based on your appetite if
you look at what the mainstream recommendation is
with calories for a female it's 2 000 calories a day
for a male it's 2500 calories a day but of course they're not factoring in
that you're doing keto or intermittent fasting when you do keto
intermittent fasting you're switching the fuel source to your
own fat calories so it's not just about your
dietary calories that you're consuming it's about also including the calories
that are on your body is stored fat a non-fat person
is walking around with over a hundred thousand calories of fat
an obese person has a lot more could be double could be 200,000
or more calories of fat now that's a lot of potential energy
to last you for many many days or some months so you really have to
look at okay so the dietary calories plus i mean it
could be 700 800 calories of your own fat
being used up every single day well that can actually factor into everything as
well you also have your age okay and
your metabolism rate if you've done a lot of diets in the past and your
metabolism is slow well then you're not going to need as
many calories of course if your stress is high that's going to
affect how many calories that you're burning
and your activity level let's say for example you're very very active and you
work out versus someone that's not very active so
you really want to look at all these things right here
now in past videos i've talked about using this one concept don't eat unless
you're hungry okay i'm going to add a few things to
that just to clarify also look at your energy if you're tired
that means you're missing something not just fuel it could be
certain nutrients because we do need fuel to run our bodies
as energy and we also need the nutrients as co-factors in the repair of tissues
in the creation of tissues in the chemical pathways
they're helper molecules to make sure everything is running
effectively we also need phytonutrients to help
protect against all the oxidation and the free radicals that
are constantly interfering with our tissues
yes we're going to be using this as a good indicator if you're not hungry
don't eat right but also be aware of your energy
and your mood if you're doing this correctly
and you have enough nutrients and you have enough fuel because you're running
on your your fat fuel your mood should be quite
high you should not have anxiety and you
definitely shouldn't have depression nor should he be grouchy also your
strength if you're strong you have a good mood and good energy
that means it's working okay so if you're not hungry
and you have these things right here then don't change anything keep going as
long as you can but if you start to get tired grouchy a
little bit weak then we know it's time to eat and also
when you eat make sure your your foods are nutrient
dense simply because after you eat you're going to be doing fasting and we
want to make sure that you have enough nutrients to run your body on
because you're not eating anything when you're fasting you're going through
autophagy and that is a process where your body is becoming very
very efficient it's recycling old proteins
and it's slowing down the need and requirement for nutrients
so you're not going to need nearly as much because your body is becoming way
more efficient now of course there are a couple other
things you want to look at i mean if you're losing hair
that could mean you need more b vitamins or more trace minerals
or you're losing muscle mass well obviously you need more amino acids
and you can take these nutrients while you're fasting which i always recommend
to make sure you can avoid these things right here and it's also just not about
giving yourself fuel and making sure you have enough nutrients
one of the bigger benefits of doing keto
and i up together are the therapeutic benefits
of reversing the effect of diabetes pre-diabetes and
insulin resistance i'm talking about regrowing
brain cells i'm talking about dropping the inflammation
restoring the heart function so it's definitely not just about losing weight
as your guide or your indicators for knowing you're doing it correctly if
your appetite goes away you're not hungry that's a really good indication
that you're in ketosis but also pay attention to your energy
level your mood and your strength

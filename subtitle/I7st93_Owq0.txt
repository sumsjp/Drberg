this video is going to cover the type of fatigue that doesn't seem to improve when you get rest
no matter how much sleep you get you're still tired the medical term for this is myalgic
encephalomyelitis not that you would ever want to know that in a million years but we can just focus
on this chronic fatigue syndrome right and there's other symptoms associated with it you have certain
delayed flare-ups like let's say you exerted yourself or had some emotional stress and then
an hour later you had a flare-up uh maybe you had some pain or inflammation um that's one symptom
usually the person has sleep problems they're moody irritable they have cognitive issues brain
fog they can't focus lack of attention sore throat the lymph nodes are swollen which is a huge clue
that there's an immune problem related to this or they have might have muscle pain now
this could be lyme's disease which by the way and it's amazing nowadays how many people are
getting ticks i mean about a month ago i mean i just get up and i have this little
itch and i look down there's a tick on me where did that thing come from so these darn ticks can
actually really create a serious problem with your health down the road if you're suspecting lyme's
disease i put a link down below and i actually explain what to do but this could be one cause
of these symptoms right here pre-diabetic can also cause some of these symptoms low vitamin d
can also cause some of the symptoms but usually the most common cause is an epstein-barr virus
that's being reactivated so many people had epstein-barr virus when they were in high school
or college and then it went away right but when it goes away it goes into remission but guess what
it can come back out under times of stress now the problem with stress is that stress shrinks
the thymus gland which is like the training center of your white blood cells the t cells
it also paralyzes your immune system it makes you very susceptible to having a virus be reactivated
so a really important question to ask yourself is when did you start having this symptom and what
happened just before it was it related to some stress event i found this is very very common or
was it related to being in the woods or whatever and getting having a tick or let's say for example
it's been for a very long time and you eat a lot of carbs or let's say it's the middle of winter
it's january and you have not taken any vitamin d and you don't consume foods high in vitamin
d just to get clues but let's assume it's this right here this is the remedy astragalus take six
grams of the dried root it's a very effective remedy two cups of water and simmer that
low heats for 30 minutes let it cool off it'll be this very thick tea and consume that do this once
a day this not only is a very potent antiviral remedy but it's also good for reducing stress
also vitamin d thirty thousand IUs per day and zinc at least a hundred milligrams a day that's
what i would recommend to put this little virus back in remission so your energy can come back hey

now this is an interesting topic that stress can actually activate mostly viruses but some
bacterias and induce an infection okay so we have tb which is triggered by stress herpes simplex
like in a cold sore which is very common in fact i think from that mistake in 90% of the population
has that virus shingles which comes out during stress which is caused by a virus it hangs out
in a dormant stage and it's activated when you go through stress h pylori which can trigger an ulcer
this is why when you go through stress sometimes stress can cause an ulcer and then the common cold
in fact there's an interesting study which i'll put down below
that is the activation of a cold and the severity is directly related to the proportion of stress
that a person can go through now not everyone who gets stressed gets the cold but it's very
common that you get stressed and then you get the cold which mostly comes from a rhinovirus
which affects the upper respiratory system and even move to the lower respiratory system
then you have hiv which is not caused by stress but it can actually trigger hiv going into aids
which is a condition where you have no more immune system so you get all sorts of complications
now just from an observation standpoint being a practice for 30 years i'm going to venture
to say that nearly 100% of the time when you ask someone when did you start noticing this infection
it was nearly always right after a stress event which is interesting so
stress tends to lower your resistance it makes you more susceptible to pulling in an
infection so you have acute stress and you have a chronic stress acute stress affects the innate
part of the immune system that's the immune system that you're born with that pretty much is kind of
like a more of a general immune system then you have a more specific immune system that targets
certain pathogens that's called the acquired immune system and that's something you develop
by being exposed and developing antibodies and adapting to your environment
so chronic stress suppresses the acquired immune system more than anything
so when you go through stress you activate cortisol and cortisol is the stress hormone
that suppresses the white blood cells so this explains why when you're under stress
you don't have that barrier as much anymore so you actually have a lowered immune system you're
more susceptible to pulling in pathogens you have decreased amount of antibodies
and you're more susceptible to getting food allergies stress actually alters the gut barrier
which allows pathogens to invade and then create an immune reaction and then create allergies and
this also explains autoimmune disorders which i've talked about in other videos being triggered by
losses which hands down is the biggest stress that someone can go through
probably the second biggest stress is people stress certain personalities that you're
in a relationship with that you can't seem to get out a relationship with
that's that's that can be very bad for your immune system and also in just the susceptibility
of getting uh infections so if you haven't seen my recent video on stress it's a great technique
to really relax your body through life and try to try to keep your body as stress-free as possible
i'll put a link down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here
what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show

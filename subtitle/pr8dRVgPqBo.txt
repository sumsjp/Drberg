hey we need to talk let's go for a drive so here's here's just a little tip when you are trying to
lose weight what people do is they they measure themselves every single day on the scale they
watch the scale they look at themselves in the mirror and they don't see anything because it's
so gradual and you're not going to see anything because it's so gradual you're going to get so
frustrated you're gonna you just gonna give up so first rule of thumb don't weigh yourself every
day okay don't even look at yourself in the mirror every day because it's you're not going to really
see anything I think it's important to take an initial picture of yourself I think it's important
to weigh yourself once a week max because that way you can start seeing a change every day it's
just too gradual it sets you up for a loss we want to build you up and wins right so that's
one thing measuring yourself I like measuring the waist as the primary indicator to know that it's
working so you measure the waist and do it every week not every day and then you can start seeing
changes and you start getting excited about that but don't be looking at yourself every day in the
mirror because that's just going to be it's just too gradual it's kind of like with exercise people
like they're working out before and after one workout looking in the mirror to see what they
look like you're not going to see any changes with one workout a better indicator would be to
focus on like how many push-ups or sit-ups or reps that you did and you can do over time to see the
improvement and you can keep measuring improvement by how able to handle a workout and how fit you
are that way you're looking very objectively at the doing misses not the happiness part because
you want to get yourself in the focus of the doing things and keep improving more doing this is keep
creating healthy body keep creating the healthy body until the sudden you like see major changes
okay so so that's pretty much the basic thing that I want you to focus on this week is to don't weigh
yourself don't look at yourself in them here focus once a week measures up once a week focus on just
increasing your fitness over time and I promise you it's going to be a lot better because then we
can build yourself up on winning not losing all right all right I'll see you next video

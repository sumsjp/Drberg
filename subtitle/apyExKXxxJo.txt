family members and your neighbor's tongue by way of the color of their
tongue no you don't want to do that i'm just
kidding and of course when i say diagnose
we're just talking about clues of potential
underlying causes this is not a full diagnosis
the color of your tongue can give you valuable information on what's going on
internally so let's go through the different colors if
the tongue is bright red it could be a folate
deficiency this is a vitamin b9 it could be
b12 deficiency it could be scarlet fever you usually get scarlet fever between
ages 5 and 15 years old or a very rare disease
kawasaki disease in children you can get something called strawberry
tongue next one is purple tongue this is very poor circulation now this
is similar to the blue tongue where you can have just
decreased oxygen hypoxia this is just more poor
circulation simply because you're getting a build up
of the venous blood which is not oxygenated okay white
tongue is usually candida or some type of
fungus or yeast now one of the most important things for
candida is you must if you ever want to get rid
of candida you have to go zero sugar and very low
carb because yeast fungus mold candida love
carbohydrates especially when you get into milk sugars
so you must avoid that you need to do keto and that's going to help you
now if the tongue is dark or black it could be some medication you're taking
or you're doing chewing tobacco or smoking excessively
or radiation poisoning can also create this effect
the tongue can potentially turn an orange color
if you take antibiotics if your tongue starts turning a little bit green it
could be a bacterial infection blue is hypoxia or decreased oxygen
yellow is more of a bacterial infection so yellow and green
could be very similar and then a pink tongue it actually is
normal so go ahead and type in the comments below

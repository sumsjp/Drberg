so why do we sleep well repair rejuvenation but also there's another reason our bodies detoxify
or shall i say our brain detoxifies while we're sleeping interesting it's probably why people
wake up feeling groggy if they drink some alcohol or even have eaten junk food because you're adding
more toxic things into the body so at the micro level you have these little on off switches going
on in the neurons but then you also have circadian waves okay every 90 minutes you have these
waves from a superficial sleep to a deep delta rejuvenating the slow wave
type sleep that's when you detox in the deep slow wave phase and when you have this on off mechanism
you have the increase of oxygen and blood flow and then the decrease of oxygen and blood flow and
when you have a decrease in blood flow you have this additional increase in what's called cerebral
spina fluid that is also circulating around the brain and that's where you're taking out
this waste and so the cerebral spinal fluid which is kind of lymph fluid is helping to flush out
this metabolic junk from your brain and it's detoxifying things like beta amyloid proteins
and other plaquing which will then help prevent alzheimer's and parkinson's things like that
so the more you detox the better the memory the better the focus the better the concentration
and of course what you eat directly relates to that because if you're also consuming things that
help detoxify your body cruciferous vegetables for example clean food it's going to help this
situation so you want to make sure that you get enough sleep most people need minimally
seven hours to nine hours i can get by with six and a half and do totally fine but then every
so often i can take a very long nap like an hour and a half to two hours and i am just i'm great
for a while so i do well on six and a half some people need more some people can get by on less
but here's the big thing that can help your deep slow wave sleep and the detox
of your brain it's exercise but i think what's even better than exercise is a physical work
where you're involving your entire body versus getting on a treadmill or just lifting weights
physical work is very therapeutic to your sleep fasting is the next most important thing and even
going to bed when you're slightly hungry that's very therapeutic to the brain and to your body
and then we have just a low-carb diet which will give you ketones so ketones are very
therapeutic to help support the brain as well all right thanks for watching hey before you go

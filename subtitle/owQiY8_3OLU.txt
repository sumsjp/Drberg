let's today talk about one of the best
remedies for not just menopausal
symptoms
but
also
menstrual problems and i'm talking about
pms related symptoms okay
now does this remedy work 100 of the
time absolutely not sometimes you have
to use other things like vitamin e
like
the iodine and seek help
and there's various other remedies that
i recommend but this particular remedy
does work the majority of time okay
whether you have
hot flashes night sweats mood changes
weight gain
or sleep problems or even uterine
fibroids
or you have menstrual issues like
cramping
depression anxiety irregular periods pms
and of course pms is basically
describing these symptoms and then this
is an advanced form of pms where you
have just worsening of the symptoms
or you have fertility issues because you
have pcos
which stands for polycystic ovarian
syndrome
so if you have any of these
what i'm going to recommend is black
cohosh let me explain why
if you do research on this topic there's
a tremendous amount of technical data
but let me just summarize on one
mechanism that i found that makes a lot
of sense okay so we have this
hypothalamus in your brain it's the
master controller of all your hormones
and it works with this other thing
called the pituitary which is the
next
level
controller in your endocrine system
so the hypothalamus releases this
communication to tell the pituitary to
release its hormones and so this hormone
is called gonadotropic releasing hormone
okay so it's telling the pituitary to
release these two right here follicle
stimulating hormone and luteinizing
hormone so these hormones right here
come down and tell the ovaries to
release estrogen progesterone and also
to release the egg in the ovary okay so
this is what's involved this whole thing
is a circuit okay it's a communication
circuit so when these hormones
are causing these different
communications
and then there's a return communication
very similar to a thermostat where
you're actually sensing certain
information and then you're going to
turn off
the cooling or the heat at a certain
temperature and so the endocrine system
has all these little receptors to turn
off the hormones once they reach a
certain level and so we have this whole
thing going on
that's constantly adapting to the
environment and what you eat
and your emotions and stress etc and one
thing you need to know about estrogen if
estrogen is too high
or too low okay you're gonna have a lot
of issues because estrogen is a mood
stabilizer it's required for serotonin
production so
if estrogen drops as in
after pregnancy you can become very
depressed
or even around perimenopause you can be
very depressed and so a lot of these
symptoms that you might have occur
because the dramatic change is either
too high or too
low now as far as black cohosh goes
the phytonutrients in black cohosh have
some very interesting
effects okay it has the ability to lower
this communication right here
gonadotropic releasing hormone as well
as lowering follicle stimulating hormone
and luteinizing hormone thereby helping
to balance this whole circuitry now as
far as what it does to estrogen
it doesn't necessarily increase it very
much or decrease it it helps to balance
it because it's a selective estrogen
receptor modulator now what the heck
does that mean it basically means it
regulates the receptors for estrogen so
if you have too much estrogen or not
enough estrogen it can help to balance
that to a certain degree but like i said
black cohosh is a really good remedy for
these symptoms but not a hundred percent
so if it doesn't work for you there's
other things to try like vitamin e
like seek help and i will put some links
down below for more videos on this topic
and i think the next most
appropriate video to watch would be the
one on estrogen i put it up right here
check it out

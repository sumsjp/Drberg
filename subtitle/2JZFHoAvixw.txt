let's talk about vitamin b5 pantothenic acid your adrenals and the quality of your sleep
the first thing you need to know is that vitamin b5 is essential for the production or synthesis
of acetylcholine which is good for your focus and memory it's also essential for making the cortisol
hormone this is the stress hormone it's also essential for making epinephrine that's
adrenaline another adrenal hormone serotonin and melatonin so as you can see it's very important
in creating the stress hormones as well as the hormones involving sleep as well as the hormones
involving your mood b5 can directly support the cell that controls the circadian rhythms
okay that's the central clock in your brain that helps you keep your circadian waves
in check and this clock is called a suprachiasmatic nucleus so b5 is necessary
to support that clock and by the way you not only have this central clock in your brain
you have other clocks in virtually every single cell in your body they're called peripheral clocks
and they're all linked up with your major clock in your brain and so this way when you're asleep you
have the rest of the body also asleep so you're not having things like restless leg syndrome as
you're trying to sleep or other conditions and so if you're low or deficient in vitamin b5
these are the symptoms that you can experience number one irritability number two fatigue athlete
numbness in the hands and the feet muscle cramps especially at night restlessness
okay that's going to affect your sleep as well as sleep disturbances in general and so when you
take vitamin b5 it actually helps to regulate cortisol let's take a look at how cortisol is
produced you have the hypothalamus okay in your brain that's like the master gland and then you
have the middle man which is the pituitary okay a lot of times people call the pituitary the master
gland but really it's the middle man the via between the master gland and the actual gland
that it's going to and so we have the hypothalamus pituitary and the adrenals okay so we have various
hormone communications throughout this pathway and so the whole goal is that the environment
like stress for example activate certain hormones in your brain through your receptors
that signal down to the pituitary and the adrenal to release its hormones to adapt the body to
stress now if you're trying to sleep at night and you're trying to adapt the body to stress
you're not going to sleep and so when cortisol is produced it sends also a signal back up to
the pituitary and the hypothalamus letting those two glands know that that function was carried out
and so this negative feedback turns off the pituitary and the hypothalamus so that hormone
doesn't have to keep being generated okay now the important thing to note is that vitamin b5 makes
the hormone from the pituitary called acth more sensitive now what does that mean more sensitive
what that means it just makes that hormone work better and more complete so when the cortisol is
produced and it's and it comes back around to turn off this pituitary it's able to turn it off and so
vitamin b5 helps this communication pathway to help regulate cortisols and also b5 is needed to
make cortisol which then allows cortisol to come around and turn off the switch as well
so when you think about b5 think about a vitamin that helps to regulate the amount of cortisol
you need so it's not too high and not too low when you're trying to sleep on top of high cortisol
you're not going to be able to sleep okay especially the second half of the sleep where
you have the rem which is the superficial type sleep you're just not going to get a quality of
sleep you're going to get up usually around 2 2:30 3 o'clock and so you can take pantothenic acid
as a supplement but there's another version of pantothenic acid that might be more powerful and
this is called pantothene which is kind of like the active form of b5 so panthenic acid has to
convert into this active form called pantothene and so some people have a problem with vitamin
b5 because they can't make this conversion and for those people they definitely need the pantothene
version of this vitamin and so if you have adrenal problems or sleep problems you may want to
add between 500 and a thousand milligrams of vitamin b5 to help you with lowering your
corsol so you can get a better sleep now if you haven't seen my recent video on sleep i
want you to check that out too because there are several other factors that you want to combine
in improving the quality of your sleep hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

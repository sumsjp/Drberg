hey i'm back with a very short video i like to keep things short and sweet let's talk about
allergies and the three things that you can do right now to reduce your allergy symptoms
now there's something called t regulatory cells it's part of your immune system t-regs
they're called for short what they do is they control the development of autoimmune conditions
as well as preventing the development of allergies okay hypersensitivities
and there are three things that can strengthen the t regulatory cells first thing is probiotics
now anytime you take a probiotic always take a very small amount in the very beginning because
sometimes it can stir up an immune reaction so whatever it says to do on the dosage just cut it
back if it's in a liquid take just maybe a half a teaspoon take it right before you go to bed
because one of the things that can do initially is increase histamines which going to make you tired
so if you have a little bit of this probiotic that's introduced to your body in a new unit
of time sometimes that reaction can make you a little bit more tired and actually you'll
sleep a little bit better so you take some see how you respond take a little bit more
take a little bit more until you get to the correct dosage but probiotics can help reduce
allergy symptoms because they improve the t regulatory cells number two this is very powerful
fasting doing intermittent fasting on a regular basis and periodic prolonged fasting
there's been a lot of reports of people doing fasting over a period of time and then all of a
sudden no longer having allergies that's both for food allergies as well as environmental i'm i'm
gonna put some links down below on all of these things right here now vitamin d vitamin d very
strongly helps the t regulatory cells work better i would recommend taking minimally ten thousand
IUs per day but it'd be probably better to take twenty thousand IUs per day and you can actually
see after a couple weeks you'll notice less allergies also vitamin d is really good for asthma
as well anyway that was a quick video thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

let's talk about how to deal with
excessive sweating
not just in your hands
but your whole body the medical term for
this is called hyperhidrosis
you have the acronym gland okay you have
another gland called the apocrine gland
and then you have the third one which is
sebaceous gland okay
so i'm going to attempt to make this
very very
simple okay just to really kind of
navigate through it in a simple way
because there's a bit of complexity
now this gland responds with exercise
uh nervousness emotional stress uh hot
weather and then the april crinkland um
responds to emotional stress fear pain
and the sebaceous gland's a little bit
different because it's releasing kind of
this little bit of an oil called sebum
for lubrication these two glands are
releasing salt and other electrolytes so
these two glands are primarily
for
cooling okay so
causing this sweating reaction and then
the evaporation of the liquid creating a
cooling sensation so these two are
really involved with temperature
regulation
and it's really the over stimulation of
this gland right here which is
responsible for this excess sweating and
it's usually triggered by some stress
usually emotion and so the body's
tolerance of stress okay
is just lowered little things will
trigger it now you may not feel stressed
but apparently your body has a very low
threshold for stress
now what's really really bizarre to me
is that the treatment that they do
on some of these cases
is surgical it's called the thoracic
sympathectomy okay they literally
remove part of your sympathetic nervous
system so in sweden this is banned
because of the side effects okay i mean
removing part of your nervous system is
is a bit invasive or they use
medications
to inhibit uh these neurotransmitter
enzymes okay i'm gonna try to again try
to keep this real simple the temperature
regulation and your your bodies in the
brain you can call it the thermostat
okay it's like in the hypothalamus so
it's very similar to what i have in my
studio right now i have the controls
and there's a little sensor over there
that detects a certain temperature of 70
degrees so anything that goes
too high or too low and that mechanism
will either kick in or cool it down or
raise the temperature so there's a
little sensor or receptor that picks up
temperature that's controlling the whole
thing same thing in the brain there's a
receptor here that picks up temperature
and either turns things off or turns
things on so we have this feedback
thermostat mechanism going on between
your hypothalamus and your skin okay so
that's as deep as i'm going to get with
that so these medications work by kind
of completing this communication
and turning off
this mechanism so it doesn't keep going
on and on and on and so
surgically
they're removing part of the sympathetic
nervous system but the medications work
on both the sympathetic and the
parasympathetic nervous system so really
they're attempting to kind of balance
out
this autonomic nervous system but they
do target the autonomic nervous system
so the question is is there something
natural is there something herbal that
can be done that mimics this without the
side effects because these medications
always have side effects and the answer
is
yes there is okay
and the very specific uh phytonutrient
that will mimic this medication is
called
rosemarinic acid which happens to be
in rosemary and sage okay so both of
these plants have this phytonutrient
that can actually help mimic this
medication now the next thing that i
found related to this topic is vitamin
b1
thymine okay
there's one side effect from a severe b1
deficiency and that severe b1 deficiency
okay if you want to know the name it's
called wernicke
corsicoff that is part of beriberi which
is a b1 deficiency one of the side
effects of the syndrome is excessive
sweating
it just so happens
thymine is involved
heavily in the autonomic nervous system
okay it's essential for the autonomic
nervous system to work and if you're
deficient in b1 you can have all sorts
of problems with the autonomic nervous
system but excessive sweating is one so
anytime you have a problem with the
sympathetic nervous system which is the
flight or fight or even the
the parasympathetic you want to use
vitamin b1 in sufficient amounts
and as an interesting coincidence the
herb sage is very rich in vitamin b1 and
vitamin b1 as far as what it does in the
brain
is it works on the limbic system which
is intimately involved with
your emotions okay so it's kind of a
relay switch involved in emotion and
emotional stress and the more emotional
stress that a person has the less b1
they're going to have because you the
requirement for b1 goes up when you
experience stress and taking b1 helps to
reduce stress but all you need to know
right now it's involved in the limbic
system so there are two things i'm going
to recommend okay number one if you have
this condition excessive sweating okay
take this
either in the form of rosemary or sage
okay and
sufficient b1 i would highly recommend
finding a natural b1 not this the
typical synthetic whatever it says on
the directions i would take like four
times the amount to see if that can help
you
all right i hope i explained this in a
very simple way i didn't want to get too
far into the woods
but the next most interesting video you
should watch is on vitamin b1 and i put
that video up right here check it out

i've done a lot of videos on cruciferous vegetables but there's one cruciferous
that i haven't really talked about so i wanted to create a video on it and it's the watercress plant
watercress it's a fascinating plant it has some serious phytonutrients isothiocyanates it has
sulfurophanes which are very anti-cancer and when you combine them with vitamin c in this plant
it supports your collagen and elastin to make you look younger it also has zeaxanthin and lutein
which adds material to help filter that blue light that is very damaging to our eyes and skin
in fact it decreases the risk of something called age-related macular degeneration it's
extremely nutrient dense it has tremendous amounts of vitamin k1 which is like helps you with the
clotting factor if you have internal bleeding it has manganese which is a co helper vitamin that
helps with making certain proteins in their body it also is a good source of vitamin c
vitamin e beta carotene it also has nitrates which have nothing to do with the preservative they put
in like bacon and sausage and things like that but these naturally occurring nitrates are really good
for the inside of your arteries they help make the arteries less stiff they help keep your blood
pressure from going too high and nitrates are really good for exercise performance if you're
an athlete they help oxygen flow to the blood and other tissues so you may want to seriously
consider adding watercress to your daily salad hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

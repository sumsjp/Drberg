so when you injure yourself you have a stuck you actually develop a stuck flow of pain and that
that thing is stuck in a joint and a muscle in the area of the body so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to demonstrate that on someone in the room who has like a real chronic pain that just
is there for a long time and won't go away you do what do you have okay does it hurt because
that's a little different okay hurt right now okay good come up here so a trigger finger is
a it's a little scar tissue that develops on the tendons that could get stuck there and you
can't move it yeah okay so we'll have you stand right here come a little closer good okay so you
have where it where's the pain okay so now the first thing did you have an injury there or just
happened carpal tunnel okay so what happens it's like it's hard to extend it or kind of get stuck
there sometimes okay and it hurts okay all right so now we're going to have someone fix it here she
goes come up here and that way I can kind of walk everyone through it right let's come over here so
you stand right over here you're going to be the practitioner you're going to be as a patient okay
you give me the doctor the patient yes you do and so here's here's the thing how many of you
have seen any of the videos on pain that I've done anyone okay how many have never saw these
videos okay this is going to kind of blow you away because this is very very different every
single technique that we're going to teach you every single procedure works on the principle
of opposites so the way we're going to fix this pain is to trigger the opposite side of the body
how many have never heard that before okay when you first hear it it's kind of like what that's
weird how could you do that well believe me it works you can select your arm now why would it
work why would working on the opposite point be more effective getting rid of pain than
working on the same side because you have all these circuits these connections that and guess
what this side of the body is connected to this side on electrical circuit when you step on a
dog's tail p-box to his mouth right so the hip bones connected to the thigh bone cuz I bones
connected so it's all connected that allows you to walk I'm just trying to break it down so when
you walk you don't walk like this you yeah sometimes you do sometimes you walk and you
think Renee your left and right side of your body every time if someone pushed me forward this foot
is going to go forward like what how did I do that because the left and right in the front back is
all connected to all these little circuits so you have electrical wires that go from this finger to
this finger and that allows you to pick things up and coordinate and support and open things up so
that's how it works very complex circuitry it's like the body's like a machine so what we can
do is we can press stimulate the exact opposite side of the body okay click it rid of the pain
point now this works like real it works fast and no one does this they don't teach us in school so
that's what I'm teaching you you're going to be quiet you're going to be quite amazed now
the thing is what's interesting about this is that when you work on the opposite side it'll
be twice as tender on the good side only when you press so apparently the energy kind of builds up
on the other side especially if it's chronic but this won't hurt normally unless you press
on it so how do we know we're on the right spot look for the point that hurts twice as much and
they'll go what the heck I didn't know that her so when she presses that point what's happening
is we are resetting the electrical circuit of basically working on the brain we're kind of
teaching the brain to turn off its electrical signal and some of you are going to say oh dr.
Burke if I stepped on your toe of course you're going to feel better and have no that's not how
it works doctor in the work so so let's let's just the first thing you do is we're going to
rate her pain 10 being very severe zero being no pain how would you rate it 10 right now okay so
now we're going to take this hand go ahead and take it and you have a point to where it hurts
can you label it get the exact spot know that let her point to it okay good so now
where would be the opposite point on that wait wait right here okay because you have to think
in opposites okay so now you're going to take this hand taking out big tickets do your thumb
and kind of work that out okay and dig in there pretty good see if you can find it you're going
to tell her if it's tender or not okay so now I'm just going to do it just to make sure that
you can relax hand with the other hand see yeah so I'm gonna press in here okay you see
her ID so you want to feel around a little more firmly to find the exact epicenter so it's like
right through in here okay go ahead and find that in right here okay press them they're a
little bit more firmly and you tell if it's the same pressure go a little harder come a little
bit more this way up good yeah is that it okay just kind of work that a little bit work that
for about an hour that's it now now so we're just kind of right now where it's kind of she
were sending circulation down to the side that she has a lost communication right there okay
so now now how long does it take this probably maybe five seconds to something's like so this
ease off there and just give me a number on that side it was a 10 okay now did it move in location
okay where's the pain now it's still here but it's not right it's left okay good so so what I'm going
to do is just to speed this up so we're just going to press press in here a little bit more so you
kind of point a little bit lower so you see how I'm just kind of going in there a little bit and
you want to just rub it a little bit and a regular basis just to kind of send the signals in there a
little bit well she's going to feel pain right now until I stop but I'm just kind of now you don't
want to press too hard I'm just kind of going in there a little bit just to kind of ease up some
of the pain through there and I'm watching your eyeball so they don't pop out and you don't want
to create too much trauma on there but can you see okay okay now let's just see what that is now
- okay did it move in location okay that's five okay all right did it move in location or still
in the same spot okay where point to it so you see what's happening it's changing see what happens it
won't completely erase until you get the exact light but since she is kind of a broad thing
sometimes you have to narrow it down so we come a little bit lower and we just kind of work right
through this point is up too painful okay good good it's like a good hurt okay so you do that
you definitely want to apologize for the pain that I'm putting her into I'm really sorry about that
and okay so now okay so let's just see what is now free okay I like that now did it move in location
okay so go ahead and take it and work work down just kind of work down that finger you use some
to do some fresher yeah just go in there and kind of small you know I don't have a cat okay
stay on that tenth yeah like we're doing half right so basically very simply we're pressing
on the optimi R image side okay now we could probably do this for maybe ten minutes and
completely get rid of that pain how long do we have it for yeah so cortisone shots
are anti-inflammatories and cortisone is an adrenal hormone and they come with a package
because it'll mess up your own Guidry nails so it will temporarily work probably just
come back we have an appointment Monday okay if you have any pain leftover dining tonight
Wow so you did it good job so what'd you give me numbers or is like what is it how would you
rate it now it's about three Wow yeah Wow all right so let's give her a good job on that rep
yeah good job so thanks for coming up you're welcome you're welcome hey guys thank you so
much for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video

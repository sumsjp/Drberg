there's a very interesting influence of fasting on the autonomic nervous system what is the autonomic
nervous system it's part of the nervous system that works on automatic and it does many things
but there's three divisions you have the sympathetic which is flight or fight you have
the parasympathetic which is the rest in digest and you also have something called the entiric
which is part of the digestive system now i had a testing device when i was in practice
that measured the autonomic nervous system it was a technology called heart rate variability
and you may be able to get your own unit that's fairly affordable i'll put a link down below for
various options for that but it's a very good way to measure how much sympathetic nervous system you
have and how much parasympathetic nervous system you have and you can do your own research to see
how fasting can influence this part of the nervous system but there's some interesting studies i'll
put some links down below that show a significant improvement in your parasympathetic nervous system
as well as significant suppression of your sympathetic nervous system so in other words
it activates the parasympathetic the ability to rest and help you digest food as well as recover
at the same time lowering your stress response your flight or fight mechanism now if we look at
the opposite situation a diabetic right because with fasting you're running your body on ketones
but if you're diabetic you're basically running on sugar right there is a condition called diabetic
autonomic neuropathy that occurs with diabetics and there's not a lot of information on this topic
but here's the thing it's well known that diabetes causes peripheral neuropathy right
like your fingertips going numb or your toes becoming numb but diabetes can also destroy
the nerves of the autonomic nervous system and this can greatly influence your heart
and your digestion and other organs here's a short list of what can happen it can increase
your blood pressure it can increase your pulse rate it can cause erectile dysfunction it can
cause orthostatic hypotension what does that mean it means that your blood pressure goes down when
you stand up too fast okay that's kind of like a mild version of another condition called pots
which i've done videos on and one of the remedies would be fasting and taking vitamin b1 by the way
constipation is another symptom gastroparesis where your digestive system is very very slow and
sluggish hypoglycemia and then thermal regulation problems and that would have everything to do with
your temperature whether you're sweating when you shouldn't be sweating or not sweating when
you should be sweating so if you have any of these conditions you should start doing fasting because
fasting can improve your overall autonomic nervous system a couple of things i would recommend take
benfotamine and alpha lipoic acid which will actually speed up the process but typically
the average person who i saw in my clinic was very very stuck in too much sympathetic nervous
system flight or fight and they just didn't have enough parasympathetic recovery or the ability
to rest get rid of their stress and actually sleep so this is just another video to encourage you to
keep fasting and if you're new to my channel and want to start fasting i put a link down below
check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

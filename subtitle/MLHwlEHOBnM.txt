hey guys we're going to show you how to get rid of pain from a heel spur or
Achilles tendinitis okay so this is how you do it let's pretend that she has a
a heel spur on the right heel and maybe some tenderness in the
Achilles tendon down here okay what we don't want to do is stretch this muscle
down here we want to work on the good side there's like three steps the first
step is to work on her calf on the good side on the opposite side so you're
going to be massaging her calf all the way down here you can do it kind of like
this we're cupping and we're coming right
down here aggressively working on this whole muscle but what's interesting
it'll be very very tender not normally but only when I press on it so we're
working at all the muscle knots this is going to take a lot of pressure off the
opposite Achilles tendon okay because they're both on electrical circuit and
when you affect this I'm sending signals through your spinal column on this side
and it's relaxing the Achilles tendon on the opposite side
okay and you want to come down right into the Achilles tendon itself on the
opposite side and really work that out for maybe three to four to five minutes
okay now step two we're going to work on the same side but the opposite side of
the foot okay so so what we'll do is we're going to get into the articulation
between the foot and the bottom of the leg and you come right into that that's
the opposite of where the heel spur is and you can come in there and really
this might be a little tender and we work that out really good and then we
inch our way up through this muscle this one right here which is called the
anterior tibialis and we want to work this top muscle not the bottom one but
the top one why because if I'm going to stimulate this muscle up here I'm going
to send signals back to the back here to loosen this up if you don't want to
massage this you can stretch this muscle by bringing the toes down and like this
now if the person goes into a cramp right here that means they need a little
bit of calcium but heel spurs are basically calcium deposits
because the person is low in vitamin k2 so if you have heel spurs or any type of
soft tissue calcium watch my video on k2 and d3 because that can help dissolve
soft tissue calcium in the body so we're going to stretch all this right here and
that's going to really help the Achilles tendon on this side so number one do the
bottom part of the calf number two the top of the foot and number three this
whole muscle right here and you'll give a person a lot of relief with the heel
spur or Achilles tendinitis so go ahead and do that and share your comments

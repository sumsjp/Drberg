i wanted to share probably one of the
most amazing success stories
that i ever heard okay and this has to
do with
a man by the name of michael who
accidentally was saved
by not eating for four days
okay so what he said last year i was
hospitalized by an ambulance when i
mysteriously started going
blind an undiagnosed diabetic with a
blood sugar of
700 milligrams per deciliter now
normal blood sugars are 80 okay
700 is so far off the chart
um it is so dangerous it's incredible he
survived
the paramedics struggled to get a vein
and i was going into a coma
150 kilograms 330 pounds
obese alcoholic clinically depressed
sick sore
rattled with meds and suicidal
at new year's i decided to simply give
up and lay down and die
in not eating for four days i strangely
didn't start to die
but actually started feeling better
stronger
and happier i tripped across dr berg's
fasting video then the penny dropped the
standard aussie diet was killing me
i've been lied to and food manipulated
my entire
56 years i've now lost 50 kilograms
that's 110 pounds
do not drink have reverse diabetes take
no medications fitter healthier
productive
lively positive have a full-time job
and most importantly i am happy finding
keto and dr berg
really has quite literally saved my life
thank you thank you thank you eric from
the bottom of my now healthy
heart amazing amazing success story
with that let's do a chat with michael
right now well it's definitely a
pleasure to meet you too your success
story was mind-blowing i was like
someone showed it to me i was like
what that so i just wanted to you know
casually talk with you chat with you and
uh
just hear it from you what happened um
oh look how long have you got like it's
a life story like everyone else isn't it
but
um to keep it concise um
i think everybody ends up being
depressed and diabetic for
a basket of reasons and and that basket
ends up being a case but
um after
a 20 odd year career
of um high stress really high stress
um and i worked as a fifo flying flight
where you guys i think called remote
workers
um i was never really based anywhere i
used to work things like um
a month on and a week off so i was
always in camps and things like that
um and so never really grounded
always on the move never far from my
backpack
and um the thing with those industries
is you have food supplied right
and it works on the typical food
triangle
and in the us i'm sure it's the same as
ours carbs on top
you know fat on the bottom uh low salt
you know but you the typical thing that
we all know about
now and um that
slowly in hindsight slowly led to a
demise
and with the constant stress pressures
and then the lifestyle that came with
that divorces
property settlements alimony i think you
guys call it
um that basically ended up bankrupting
me and um
that added financial stress to my life
even though i was earning
mid mid triple mid six digits i ended up
with bugger all of that
and so i found myself high stress long
hours high pay
nowhere to live no real money of my own
it was a bit of a crazy thing
that all ended up culminating in
somewhat of what i suppose you could
call a nervous breakdown
in essence and um i um
ended up just going no i can't do this
anymore and i just
stopped i had some money behind me and i
just stopped working
without really noticing it set in i
ended up
um basically locking myself in a room
for the best part self-isolating before
there was even a word
wow and um
as much as i love to cook i was cooking
the sad stuff and lots of mashed potato
gravy all the yummy gear right
um still along with a lot of veg and
you know decent meat and whatnot but
that combination of
carbs and fat as we all know doesn't
work right
and so i this incremental weight gains
all right just a little bit a little bit
a little bit year after year
um and it wasn't until one day i was in
a cbd
and i spotted myself in
the automatic doors of a multi-story
building and thought
wow i'm a keg on legs like when did this
really happen
wow and um i thought i don't like the
look of that
but i'm not completely i'm not very
egotistical or superficial and i think
my
fireman calendar of the year days are
well and truly past me so
i wasn't too concerned about it and
um and i was still getting by and um in
my career i went higher and higher in
management so i was doing less physical
activity
outdoors and and what i did do i could
get through okay
because it was limited and um
then the depression set in um
i in hindsight didn't realize that i've
been depressed for a very long time
just bad life basically and
as much as having the porsches and the
beachfront condo
and all the rest of it looks fabulous to
everyone else
um from the inside out it's not so great
and
in my case and the um and i thought well
i don't i don't need any of that
and i um
was occasionally strangely i was
occasionally testing my blood sugars a
friend of mine was diabetic
type one and so when i visit him i just
play with the machine and have a test
and
my numbers were coming back mid-level
standard sad person right nothing to be
really concerned about
and um that's all
that's surprising considering i live on
um
jamaican rum and a very well-known cola
and wasn't no fate or the odd
drive-through takeaway from you know the
king the clown or the colonel
and um
[Music]
then slowly i started um
with with the whole falling down thing
physically um all of a sudden i started
to become
constantly thirsty
and this accelerated really really
quickly where i was
i was drinking oh easy
10 liters a couple of gallons of
fluid and it was just in and out in and
out it was just like a
transfer station for fluid and i thought
this is getting a bit
weird and just constantly thirsty and i
thought
around the same time not not too long
after that
i popped out my front door looking down
the street
and i realized all of a sudden the
things i could read yesterday
i couldn't read today signs
numbers on letterboxes and whatnot
everything was starting to go a bit
hazy and a bit blurry and i thought your
eyesight
goes down over time but not overnight
so i'll pop to the local clinic and see
a gp
and um he went oh okay
did a blood test and went um
dude you've got numbers of like
you guys working my decimal 740
gosh and um i know
okay is that a bad thing and so you guys
yeah um um
uh dude you're gonna go into a coma and
i went
okay well i'll get myself down to
hospital i'm gonna
pop home and you know pack a bag for
hospital and let's go
and uh so what do i have to look out for
with this
whole coma thing you won't you won't
know you'll just fall into a coma okay
and there's no going home the ambulance
is on its way
dude i'm like okay
here's me still a little bit like
oblivious to this so
in hindsight and climbed into the uh
ambulance and our paramedics i imagine
very much like yours amazing people
angels right
and um he's trying to get blood it's not
coming
it's could turn to treacle you can't get
veins and getting slapped and
tourniqueted and
what's going and on then um
paramedics have this amazing way of not
showing concern
yeah they'll just keep chatting to you
about
random stuff football or whatever right
and um while they're doing their job
um i know he started to get concerned
when
i had a defibrillator strapped to me and
uh when he asked the um the driver
how far away from the hospital and she
said eight minutes and he said can we
make it six
i thought um
okay um we have a thing here called
ramping
um too many ambulances roll up at once
and so they ramp they get stacked like
airplanes
i ended up getting gurneyed straight
past everyone straight into er
and um yeah and that's when they put me
on bags and all sorts of things and
whatnot
and uh that's when the seriousness of
the whole thing sort of set in
and um they got my numbers down pretty
quick down to
about half of that about 350 or
something
but then bless their hearts they kick me
out
and um i
at that point was given the standard two
medications
for diabetics and um
a couple other odds and size my blood
pressure was through the roof
if my car had the same pressure oil
pressure i'd be pretty happy with it
but not in a human body and
the um so i was basically just
sent home on my own merry way um
then um i ended up uh inadvertently
breaking my ankle
um survive two helicopter crashes and a
couple of car rollovers i trip over a
garden chair and break my ankle
go figure ended up back in hospital
um same thing in the ambo in in the
ambulance do a blood test
must be a standard thing right and oh
your numbers are like serious man
i thought that's interesting um
in hospital while i'm waiting around
with my broken ankle
um they're feeding me toast fruit juice
milk i i saw a um i saw a bit of yours
recently on how
you know hospital food isn't let's just
say the best
and i think you're like
what's with this people i can't eat any
of this stuff
right like just bring me a lettuce from
the anorexic department or something you
know
um and uh they really didn't want to
know about it
when um when i was chatting to the
doctors going okay
ankle it's a broken bone i've had many
it'll fix itself it's not a big deal
and but this diabetes thing um
i want to treat that no you're not here
for that you're here for an ankle if you
want to treat your diabetes go see your
local gp
okay then they kicked me off what they
have is their
diabetic menu which isn't awesome anyway
it must been too much trouble or
something i don't know but
um ended up leaving there and yeah
things still went downhill from there my
depression got worse
um covert in australia happened in a
wave
and i ran away from covert not because i
was scared of it is because it
it screwed with jobs and accommodation
and all sorts of things
and i ended up finding this um where i
am now this
gorgeous place on the seaside on the
southern coast of australia
and um i'd got rid of a lot of the
stresses in my life and everything else
and i had no reason to be unhappy
i was still terribly depressed and
depression isn't a state of mind it's
almost like a
disease an illness a sickness something
um and
i don't know a lot of things culminated
and i ended up just going like
i screw it like um
i really just gave up and
laid on my bed basically for like four
days
and i'm a smoker and an addicted one
it's the only vice i have left but um
normally i couldn't go a few hours
without a cigarette i'll start
just getting the craves you know as an
addict and
um yeah i was that depressed i couldn't
even be
bothered going to get cigarettes and
um for as much as i was craving them
and what i thought was a bit weird
was um after about three days
i started to feel better right when
the exact opposite life's like this the
exact opposite of what i was trying to
achieve which was to basically just
i don't know somehow just stay on my bed
till i don't wake
up anymore right right and um
all of a sudden i thought
a bit hungry but i'm not actually hungry
i think i'm hungry
but i'm not how weird is this four days
normally i couldn't go four hours
without eating something right
that's what i used to do was drummed
into us you know eat every you know eat
three square meals a day and then
have something every two hours in
between that and all the rest of it
and um i was pretty used to that sort of
thing and
snacking a lot as we did you know and um
so i thought what's what's with this
um that's when i trip
that's when i had started having a bit
of a look at the whole
um fasting thing and it then it dawned
on me i saw something
20 years ago on indian yogis i think
they are um and they
were sitting on a beach for like a week
and all they ate was butter and yogurt
and they lost weight right and they're
pretty healthy looking dudes and i
thought
what's with that right so i started
looking into it i tripped across one of
your
videos on um on
fasting and then what really got me
interested was
the um fatty liver
and um inflammation
and a friend of mine is quite a healthy
person and um
she um she used to bang on me about
inflammation but i didn't get it i
i related inflammation to things like
rheumatoid arthritis inflamed joints and
things of that nature not having an
inflamed body or organs
so once that penny dropped and the
fasting thing
and a lot of other research
and luckily keto's
been studied a lot like scientifically
the results you know kellogg's hated but
the um but it makes sense there's a lot
of fact there that you can't deny
right and it's not a mystery it's
um and uh i just thought oh
this is a bit strange okay well i'll um
i'll lay off of this and that and i
actually like
whole foods so let's just give this a go
for a little while and
all of a sudden um in a very very short
period within
couple of weeks um
i had this epiphany i think drunks call
it a moment of clarity
and um lots of pennies dropped like
i feel better because i'm not doing this
i'm not doing that and
i found keto for me it's extremely easy
it's one of the easiest things i've ever
done in my life
um because it's more about instead of
doing things
it's about not doing things
right so um i found being lazy by nature
um keto suited me perfectly because it
was more about don't stick things in
your mouth
um and the um and the things you do
be aware of what they do and
quite quickly my numbers plummeted down
to
um i was averaging
low fives which for you guys is i know
about what 90 or 100
or something in that area yeah and
that's when i really saw the difference
and then i started feeling better then
all of a sudden
i noticed that i was happier
wow
things that i used to be quite angry at
the world
like not um not outwardly but
internally i would look at things and
just get
angry about it you know and spend most
of my life trying to fix
fix the world and some of the people in
it
and um and i thought no no no all you
can do is your own little bit and start
with yourself
like the old head if you can't help
anyone if you can't help yourself and
um but the biggest thing for me with
keto
was um the um
the mental side of it the mental health
side of keto
and then the weight loss was just
a complete byproduct of that i found
that completely amusing
to be honest and i never focused on i
just tried to keep my blood sugars
down in a decent region and um
and my ketones somewhere at least have
some
and um and just get about with my daily
life and from there everything is just
snowballed in a fantastic way that i was
losing
what the medical profession would call
unhealthy amounts of weight
like really fast
and the um
um now i've um
i found my bloods uh in the i average
about
4.8 about 80 or something for you guys
um my weight loss is um still going down
it's a bit negative logarithmic
it's not as fast as it used to be um but
my ketones vary between 0.5 and 3
depending on what i'm doing
i find when my blood sugars go up and
down a little bit or my ketones go up
and down a little bit
i physically can't actually notice that
it doesn't seem to make any difference
in my day-to-day life but now i just
have
so much energy and the whole depression
thing
went away the negativity went away so
now i'm a big
proponent in um
when healthy body healthy mind
not that i'm a health's not by any
stretch of the imagination
right but i noticed just getting
dealing with the fatty liver which then
in turn deals with everything else just
all by itself um
and and the inflammation side of things
i think what a lot of people don't
appreciate is um your brain is an organ
just like your liver
when you get a fatty brain things get
foggy and
funny thing i hear when people say you
know the keto fog
my life was like that like um
i found it before keto i found it very
difficult to
or increasingly more difficult to
compartmentalize
problems in life it all just sort of got
thrown into one big casserole dish
and that became overwhelming
um whereas with keto um all of a sudden
and i only noticed this after the after
the
event um things that
before where i just couldn't be bothered
like i'd left something in my car
and my car's only 50 feet away can't be
bothered
getting that seriously all right now so
i don't even think about it i just grab
my keys go get it come back
right um load the dishwasher or unload
the dishwasher
later you know now i see it i just do it
a minute
i mean oh my god it just sounds like you
know um
there is this uh kind of disconnect
initially with the depression not really
connected to your body and then you find
this
huge realization oh my gosh my
depression has been
my physical body has been so far out of
balance that put me in a certain lower
emotional state which then makes your
whole universe completely um
dismal you know all these
thoughts and then you you pull yourself
out of this thing
you with with the most important thing
you could do
you happen to do it you start switching
over the fuel source to ketones
it starts feeding your brain starts and
then that just brings your emotions
right up to where you are
normally where you should be normally
and now all of a sudden you're you're
back to yourself it's like
yeah and um and i haven't
hindsight's a wonderful thing isn't it
um i realize i've been
like sad um
not both diet and emotionally um
for a very very long time like i'm 56
now and it's probably been
since i was in my early 20s
you know um i did get to a point because
of my depression i got put on
antidepressants
the name of those products couldn't be
more oxymoronic
um honestly the longer you're on them
the worse it gets
right and they're super addictive
getting off them
was difficult really difficult and they
make you physically sick when you come
off them
swooshing sounds in your head and all
sorts of madness
um not good i don't recommend those to
people
there's better ways not to be depressed
but yeah i've um i've found the whole
mental health aspect
of um just yeah lifting the cloud um
and now i found it really easy just to
avoid things that
are avoidable the things that are
avoidable in life
avoid them and um the things that are
good grab onto those gravitate towards
those
and it's very much easier now to see the
differences in all of those things
because
life isn't really black and white it's
all shades of grey and
you've got to choose the template you
want and um
the biggest benefit of founder of keto
is the mental health
side of it well i want to thank you for
taking the time and doing this i think

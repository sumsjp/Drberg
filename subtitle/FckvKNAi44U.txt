I have been the executive assistant to
the vice president of the world's third
largest oil and gas company at the world
headquarters I've also been an executive
assistant and personal assistant to one
of the founders creators and who is
still working with one of the largest
magazine
magazines published today all over the
world
as well as being executive assistant to
three
very very top level Executives at Morgan
Stanley
which all of that combined with my
singing career as well and my own life
of course which is very happy and
wonderful but everything combined is can
be a real pressure cooker and
when you combine that the stresses of
that day-to-day life
with the the EMF exposure from
fluorescent lights and from computers
cell phones I became my body terrain
became very toxic and very unbalanced
energetically and I really maxed out my
adrenals
when I came to Dr Burke they were very
mixed out he could not believe it and um
the treatments have been
have been wonderful
it's it's a very unique sensation
it's not
massage it's different than that very
much so
you really just have to experience it
there's no pain involved
it actually feels more like a release
and after the treatments I feel so much
better I feel very light very
unstressed and with each treatment that
I've gotten there seems to be a
consecutive
kind of coming together of myself a
wholeness a healing that's re-emerging
but this wonderful joyful Serenity that
I had missed
thank you doctor
so in the beginning the graph had maxed
out for the adrenals and the recovery
was absolutely
zero
there was hardly any recovery at all and
now this is the second day of treatment
and we have done the graph a few times
and
at the most recent reading the instead
of being maxed out the flight or flight
needle is
almost perfectly balanced
and it made a remarkable Improvement
just after one or two treatments
after we had done the second test so
this is now the second day and and the
chart has almost balanced itself out
completely

let's talk about the top natural remedies for a uti urinary tract infection now what
is a urinary tract infection it's an infection that could occur in the bladder or in the ureter
or in the urethra or even the kidney so you have two kidneys that drain through these tubes
they're called ureters okay they drain into a bladder and then there's one tube that comes
out that's called the urethra so if you have an infection anywhere in this area you have an uti
now the UTIs are the second most common infection behind respiratory infections so they're very very
common women are more susceptible than men and 70 year old women are two times more susceptible
than men but much younger women are 50 times more susceptible than men interesting 90 percent of an
infection from UTI is e. coli which normally is in the colon so somehow that bacteria from your colon
is getting into the wrong place all right so what are the symptoms painful urination
frequent urination blood in the urine and even abdominal pain so what can you do number one
make sure your liquids are a little bit higher drink at least 2.5 liters per day or even more
to keep things flowing through your body also vitamin c is very very important i would make
sure that it's a food based vitamin c not a synthetic version and i would take
at least 500 milligrams of the natural vitamin c unsweetened cranberry juice has certain
compounds and phytonutrients that make the bacteria not stick to the inside of
the bladder or these little ducts right here or these little tubes right here so
unsweetened cranberry juice is actually really good um you can put that in this water right here
number four a really good probiotic that involves a lactobacillus bacteria that can counter the e. coli
so a good probiotic is very very important taking garlic can act as a natural antibiotic
it's very high in sulfur it has no bad effects to our own good bacteria only to the unfriendly
versions and yuva your seed tea is a really good remedy for utis as well now the last thing i

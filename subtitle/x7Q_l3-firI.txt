hey dr. Berg here in this video I want to explain the side-effects from having
your gallbladder removed a lot of times people have been told that it's an extra
organ you don't need it honestly it's probably one of the most important
organs for long-term health of course you need your heart and your liver but
that gallbladder helps you absorb all the healthy fats do you realize that
your brain is made out of fat all your nerves are made in fat all the cells
have the fat layer it the bile B-I-L-E that is produced by the gallbladder
actually it's stored by the gallbladder that's produced by the liver helps you
break down and utilize vitamin A for the vision night vision skin immune system
sinus vitamin D vitamin E for the heart vitamin k2 which is basically for
calcium transportation to prevent heart problems so if you don't have a
gallbladder these are some of the side effects that occur number one
poor night vision acne that's a vitamin A deficiency and so is this and even if
you take vitamin A it didn't get it doesn't get absorbed so you'll show
deficiencies soft-tissue calcium well that can show up in cataracts calcium
building up in arteries it's could be stroke or heart attacks high blood
pressure you have also tartar in the teeth kidney stones arthritis bursitis
tendinitis heel spurs bunions soft tissue calcium in the breast so a lot of
different things because you don't have vitamin D or k2 to transport that
calcium and even osteoporosis long term low vitamin D levels which can affect
your mood depression immune system and bloating because bile helps you digest
and even constipation because you don't have anything to lubricate the colon
right shoulder pain because it can refer up to the right side and you can have
pain right so I did a whole video on pain you can watch that and how to get
rid of that but but yes you do need a gallbladder if you don't have a
gallbladder it can create side effects and I have a product called Gallbladder
Formula and that has a number of things purified bile salts it has slippery elm
bark to lubricate the colon it has Spanish black radish it has Stone
root if there's another stone that needs to be dissolved so there's a lot of
different factors to kind of replace what's missing and you just take one
with breakfast or one with each meal depending how many problems that you
have and to help you support what's missing okay so I just want to kind of
enlighten you on the gallbladder because a lot of times they don't tell you this
after you remove it like the all the long-term effects but you really want to
watch the fat type of vitamin deficiencies that could have create that
could be created like a year or two years later

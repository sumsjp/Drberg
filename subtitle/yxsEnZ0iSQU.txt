so why do people sleep better in a cold room if i could talk my wife into it i probably
would like to sleep in a dark cool cave but your temperature in your environment affects
this hormone called melatonin melatonin is a sleep hormone it's also affected by darkness
so when it gets dark out it increases and you go to sleep it turns into serotonin
which also contributes to sleep and so a cooler temperature will increase melatonin and melatonin
actually causes your body to run cooler at night in fact when you have an insomniac someone who
cannot sleep their temperature is usually hotter than people that can sleep so something you may
want to try if you have sleeping problems or you want to improve your sleep quality is adjusting
the temperature of the room to between 60 to 68 degrees fahrenheit or 15 to 20 degrees celsius
now what i do in the winter i'm not suggesting you do this i actually turn my heater off of my
room and so it gets pretty cold but i sleep great when it's cold and so the other thing that can
affect your sleeping is that the memory foam i do not like memory foam it just
it contains the heat and it's uh it's very difficult and it's very difficult for me to sleep
if you have memory foam either get rid of it or get a gel top just to cool you down
some people use fans to help cool them they sleep better i like keeping the window open of course
not in the winter and some people even leave their feet out of the covers and it seems to help their
sleeping so let's talk about the hormone that helps you sleep it's melatonin having enough
melatonin can help you fall asleep quicker it can enhance your mood it can establish better blood
sugars it can enhance your cognitive function it can enhance your immune system melatonin is
a powerful antiviral it's a powerful antioxidant so it's not just about sleep and number six it can
help increase the quality of sleep and actually help you feel more rested and really there's
just three big things that affect melatonin one is darkness keeping your room very very dark darkness
stimulates melatonin light suppresses melatonin so you don't want any lights in your room um also
actually i lied there's four things emf electromagnetic fields your cell phone
uh the wiring that's next to your bed that's plugging your lamp in there or anything else
you have plugged in or any recharger right next to your bed you don't want to have that because
that can affect your sleep and then temperature you want to be a little on the cool side and last
thing is stress too much stress can inhibit your melatonin actually i'm going to add one more and
that would be vitamin d if you're deficient in vitamin d as most people are during the winter
that can greatly suppress your melatonin production hey before you go real quick i have
a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it
and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system

is there a good way to measure the ph of your blood this question comes up quite frequently
are you too acid or are you too alkaline now you can try to figure this out through symptoms
and there is another test to measure your ph it's very very difficult to do because as soon as you
take your blood out and it's exposed to oxygen that ph gets changed so it's very very difficult
but there is another indicator that you can look at to get a rough idea of what your ph
is and that is to check your bicarbonates okay now bicarbonates are an alkaline substance and it's
actually considered one of the electrolytes which is interesting because it does work with other
electrolytes like sodium chloride and potassium to help maintain electrical neutrality in your
cells so in other words it helps to buffer the ph in fact your pancreas makes bicarbonates to
neutralize the stomach acid that is coming into the small intestine but you also have bicarbonates
in your blood to buffer the ph to kind of keep it at a certain level and they're an electrolyte
because they carry in a negative charge when going through the body and so you will normally measure
the bicarbonates when you get a basic metabolic panel a bmp or a cmp comprehensive metabolic panel
or if you get a blood gas panel but typically you'll actually get this information if you just
get your basic metabolic panel or your comprehensive metabolic panel and they'll actually
give you the range between normal and abnormal so you can kind of see if you are low or too high now
what conditions might you have high bicarbonates in well if you have severe prolonged vomiting
or diarrhea because you're losing a lot of electrolytes when you vomit or you have diarrhea
copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cushing's syndrome which is a an adrenal problem
where you have higher levels of cortisol you'll see high levels of bicarbonate and so this would
kind of give you an indication that your body is too alkaline and you need to acidify it and you
can take apple cider vinegar between hydrochloride but realize that's just treating the symptom okay
of course you'd want to you know fix the reason why you have severe prolonged vomiting or diarrhea
or you know why you have copd or why you have cushing's which is stress so there's a there's two
things one is treating the symptom another thing is treating the cause and so i'm just saying that
you could actually acidify the body and start to reduce the bicarbonates but you have to also
correct the real problem now let's say for example your bicarbonates are low well that happens in
addison's disease which is a an adrenal problem where you don't have enough adrenal hormones you
basically ran out of adrenal hormones also can occur with chronic diarrhea so with
chronic diarrhea you can have either high or low bicarbonates okay depending on other
factors which i'm not going to get into now you also see low bicarbonates if you have diabetic
ketoacidosis because it has the word keto in it i have to explain it's very rare for a person to
have keto acidosis unless they are a diabetic type one if you're doing the ketogenic diet you are not
going to get ketoacidosis so you don't have to worry about that but if you are a type 1 diabetic
and you're not taking your insulin correctly your ph can go very very high through the ketones
and basically when you do a blood test it's going to show up with low bicarbonates
in which case you need to alkalize the body really quick and you could probably take some baking soda
that would help and some other things including taking your insulin all right with kidney disease
we have a ph problem because the kidneys and the lung are constantly helping you adjust your ph
the kidneys are releasing a lot of acids and if they're dysfunctional
they can't release the acids so you become too acid you can't regulate that correctly you also
have the lung getting rid of co2 constantly and so it's also trying to adjust the ph
now if you're also having to take a lot of aspirin because you have migraine headaches or you have
pain and you overdose you're going to see low bicarbonates now i have a lot of videos on what
to do if you have alkalosis or acidosis but this video is just on how do you measure your ph hey
before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free
course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused
on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your
immune system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so
you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune
system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

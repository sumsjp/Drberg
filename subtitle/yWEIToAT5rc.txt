are you still craving on keto and you're
not sure why
here's what happens normally when you
convert from sugar to fat burning it
takes
three days if your carbs
are really really low if you do keto and
your carbs are a little too high
this three days can turn into five days
two weeks it could be a long time
so the lower the carb the faster that
you're going to convert
into ketosis fat burning
all right number one your carbs are too
high
now the range of carbs should be between
like 30 grams to 50 grams
of carbs per day not per meal
for some people 50 grams is actually too
much especially if they had a history of
consuming a lot of carbs and they have
really bad insulin resistance or they're
pre-diabetic or diabetic
so if you stick with 30 or less you'll
be pretty
good but the most common reason why
you're craving is your carbs are too
high and the two big things that you
know that you're in ketosis and it's all
working
is cravings going away and you're no
longer hungry
now i always recommend doing fasting and
keto at the same time
because every time you eat you trigger
insulin to some degree regardless if
that meal
is keto friendly so you're always
triggering
insulin to some degree when you're
eating so
instead of three meals definitely do two
meals
now if your meals are spread out like
this
let's say first meal is at eight a.m in
the morning breakfast and you skip the
lunch
and then you eat at eight at night that
gives you a 12-hour
fasting window it's just not going to be
long enough
i mean it's better than three meals
but i would prefer if you took this meal
right here and you pushed it
closer to this meal so we can bring this
down
so we have a longer period of fasting
and so as far as
quantity of food that's less important
than frequency of meals so if you took
2 000 calories of food for a given day
and you broke it up into small little
meals
compared to having all 2000
in one meal or maybe broke break it up
into two meals but they're very close
together so you have a longer period of
fasting you'll be much better off
if you condense the foods and reduce the
frequency of eating
than to spread it out of the over the
entire day
number three snacking in between meals
this is slightly different some people
think
that oh i'm just having a little bit of
this it's keto friendly
just a little bit of food right they
might do a little keto friendly cookie
between meals
to tide them over that defeats the whole
purpose of fasting
it's going to break your fast and guess
what it's going to raise insulin a
little bit
what you need to understand is eating
makes you
hungry now it sounds kind of stupid but
every time you eat especially a small
little thing
which is not going to be very satisfying
about one and a half hours
you're going to be hungry and so
don't snack between meals take those
so-called keto snacks and consume them
right at the meal or right after the
meal as a dessert
number four too much protein
more than eight ounces of protein for an
average person
is a little too much so anything more
than that tends to turn into
glucose or it is wasted in the urine
and so what people don't realize is that
protein by itself
is not used for fuel but it can be
broken down into
glucose if you're having too much and
then that could be used
as fuel so if you're eating this you
know 16 ounce steak
at a restaurant the next morning you're
gonna be really hungry
all right number six eating too late at
night this just kind of throws off this
whole fasting cycle
so if you eat late at night you may
notice the next morning that you're
now you're craving certain things so
it's really good if you could just eat
that last meal
six seven o'clock and then not eat
anything after that that's the ideal
situation
you'll find that you'll do very well
because then you'll you have a period of
fasting then you go to bed
you're fasting all night and you should
not be hungry
in the morning if you are hungry in the
morning chances are
your carbs are too high for that last
meal all right number six
eating too much food during a i don't
know holiday or something or
thanksgiving you eat this massive meal
where you're completely stuffed
even if it is keto friendly you're going
to be hungry the next day
simply because it's going to create a
lot of stress in the digestive system
and a lot of those extra calories will
be turning into glucose
simply because it's too much to actually
assimilate and use this energy
and one point about six the question is
how much food do i eat
well it's going to have to be an
individual thing based on your
individual sweet spot so
you want to have enough so you're not
completely
stuffed for many many hours like
the next meal you're not even hungry at
all you can just keep going
because you jam so much food in there
it's just overwhelming the system
versus just the meal is just too small
just not enough to sustain you
especially since you need certain amount
of foods to satisfy your nutrient
requirements
and you can figure this out just by
trying certain amounts over two days and
then you'll know
okay i need this amount of protein this
amount of carbs this amount of fat all
right number seven
stress stress will release
glucose stress will increase cortisol
which will then release
glucose and that's going to throw off
your blood sugars so
that's another hidden factor number
eight a lack of sleep
if you ever notice those days that you
haven't slept you're craving
certain things that you shouldn't be
eating so this is really stressful on
the blood sugar
system because it increases cortisol
all right number nine keto desserts um
i think they have it their place i think
they're okay for some people i think
they're good in the beginning
but ideally it's not good down the road
to do too many keto desserts
especially because it's not really
coming from
an actual like steak or a salad it's
like a concentrated almond flour
which is not really natural or you're
doing certain amounts of oils in
combination
with sugar alcohols which create a lot
of digestive issue
so i suggest not on a regular basis but
you know periodically go ahead and do it
for
holidays or you know if they don't
bother you go ahead but i will say that
too many keto desserts especially with
the sugar alcohol
can create hunger because certain sugar
alcohols
are not completely zero on the glycemic
index
some are a little bit higher like
xylitol for example
so for me i do one little packet it's
just a tiny bit
in my coffee in the morning and that's
it for the whole day and my coffee is
like literally it's like
just a small little thing it's strong
but i don't do a lot of xylitol
the other thing i want to point out is
that when you do a lot of almond flour
it's high in oxalates so you may find
that it could increase your risk of
kidney stones if you're prone to that
or it can also irritate your joints and
you can feel like you're getting like
arthritis from that
i'm just saying that not as something
that's common but it can
happen all right last thing is hidden
sugars
for this one it could be a lot of
different things number one
yogurt for example is very high in sugar
uh and i'm even talking about the plain
yogurt
kefir has sometimes too much sugar for
certain people
and that's just enough to bump them out
of ketosis
you also have so-called keto-friendly
foods that are not keto friendly so read
the ingredients uh observe what's in
there
certain companies put maltodextrin they
put dextrose they actually put sugar
they put
wheat tapioca and there's telling you
they're keto friendly but they're really
not and i had one person who actually
was consuming gatorade for example and
they
thought that was sugar-free and it
really wasn't
or they might do something like coconut
water which has quite a bit of sugar
or they might not understand that honey
is very similar to sugar
or agave nectar is like even worse than
sugars all right so these are
kind of all the reasons why you might be
craving on keto to look at to see
what you need to change
hey before you go real quick i have a
course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system
it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your

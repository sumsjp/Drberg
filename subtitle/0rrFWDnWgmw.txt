so today we're going to talk about the nine ways you can boost your stress tolerance your ability
to tolerate stress and cope with life if you get highly irritable when you're behind a slow driver
this video is for you if you work at a daycare center and you're around
small children all day long for over eight hours this video is for you but before i get started
i want you to note down below in the comment section how would you rate your
stress tolerance right now is it high medium low make a note down below all right number one
increase your sleep if you're not sleeping through the night and waking up feeling refreshed
you're not going to have a lot of patience you're going to have a short fuse and you're
going to be highly irritable now there's many things you can do to improve sleep probably the
the biggest thing is to avoid blue light or blue led light from this thing before you go to bed
or your computer or your tablets because that suppresses melatonin between one and three hours
there's many other things i put a link down below of additional things that you can do
but you need more sleep if you haven't watched my other videos on taking b1 for stress uh you're
in for a treat because taking nutritional yeast which is one of the best sources of b1 and other b
vitamins will give you instant relief from stress within minutes you're going to feel a sense of
relaxation you're going to be able to tolerate stress a lot better i remember in my clinic i
had a husband and wife that were fighting i put them in separate rooms and i went in
there and i gave them some nutritional yeast and within about 10 minutes they're in communication
they're holding hands and they no longer were fighting so it really works number three low carbs
now i wish i would have known this a long time ago because personally i had a blood sugar problem so
bad up and down and i had a very low tolerance to stress coming from a low blood sugar situation so
going a low carb will fix your blood sugars and stabilize your mood and your tolerance for stress
especially in the morning when you wake up you may not realize this but if you feel better
when you eat as far as your mood and your stress tolerance that means you have a blood sugar issue
if you find that you can't wake up in the morning because you're groggy that means you have a blood
sugar issue do the low carb diet i put a link down below of how to do that all right number four
which should be number one avoid the news especially bad news because it's usually
false or fake news the problem with the news is it keeps you in the state of fear
it keeps you in a state of stress you can get physically sick when you're in this fear mode
and it's definitely going to affect your sleep and it's definitely going to keep you with a very low
tolerance to stress all right number five exercise will increase oxygen it will also help you
counter stress we can never get rid of stress but we can do things to remove stress from our
body and exercise is a real good way to do it on the days that i don't exercise my sleep is not as
good and my tolerance for stress is definitely not as high on the days that i do exercise
all right number six magnesium it's a natural physiological tranquilizer it actually can help
you deal with stress if you consume at least seven cups of vegetables per day like a huge salad that
can give you enough magnesium what's interesting too is spring water like pellegrino or mineral
water is loaded with magnesium and so if you drink that water all day long you would get you know
several hundred milligrams of magnesium and it's the type of magnesium that is very bioavailable
number seven vitamin d especially if you can get it from the sun but if you're consuming cod
liver oil or fatty fish or getting it from the sun vitamin d typically will help decrease depression
and anxiety and reduce stress and also help you get into the deeper delta wave circadian waves of
sleep all right number eight ketones when you go on a ketogenic diet combining healthy ketosis with
intermittent fasting a lot of positive things will happen one being an elevation of your emotions
your mood you'll actually feel a lot more up than down and you'll be able to tolerate stress much
better and your cells actually tolerate stress you have more stress resistance last thing change your
environment get out in nature now i've had patients go on a vacation go off their eating plan
and actually lose weight simply because of this change of environment getting away from certain
stressful people getting in a new environment i like getting out nature can greatly increase

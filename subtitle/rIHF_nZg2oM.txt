so is fast weight loss really healthy okay we're gonna answer that it really
depends on how you do it okay so typically most people go on a diet a
low-calorie diet okay of course it's not a low carbohydrate diet it's a
low-calorie diet and they feel like crap and they're hungry and they're always
starving and they're always craving carbs okay
in the wrong foods and they're exercising and they're fatigued and
they're trying to lose weight and maybe they might get to their goal okay but of
course they gain it right back because it's not sustaining and then they go in
the next day and the next day so the more times you do this the more the
metabolism just slows down to the point where it's at a snail's pace
and now if basically you ruin your metabolism now you can't lose weight no
matter what you do so that's a typical scenario or someone will do a lower fat
diet not necessarily always worried about the calories but the low fat and
do different combination of macros but with these people they're never
satisfied they're kind of always hungry as well and one of the problems with
doing it healthily is providing all of the nutrients and some really key
nutrients have to do with the fat soluble vitamins and essential fatty
acids and so if you're on a low-fat diet over a period of time you're gonna
create deficiencies with those factors which are very very very important in to
in supporting your endocrine system the hormone system the system that actually
helps you burn fat in the first place so this is this comes with a package doing
this but a lot of people do it so really it's not a healthy thing to do and then
you have other people that go in a low calorie and they do appetite
suppressants and so they're basically that's how they're getting rid of their
appetite okay artificially and that comes with a package because it too
stresses the metabolism and the adrenal gland and soon as they get off they've
gained the weight back but now they have this these issues with side effects so
it's not a great thing so the real key in losing weight fast but doing it
healthily is making sure that you always keep the nutrients there
so you're not depriving yourself of any nutrients because this is really what
stresses the thyroid it slows the metabolism one of the challenges you
might run into is how are you going to provide all the fat soluble vitamins and
essential fatty acids at the same time not consume so much fat that your body
is basically always just burning the dietary fat and not your own fat well
you're gonna have to do intermittent fasting and eventually kind of work up
to one meal a day if you're if you want to see some fast weight loss so again if
you've never watched my videos I'm gonna put a link down below intermittent fasting
because you definitely need to include that but a lot of you watching already
know about that so the way that you do this is that you have a good sized meal
where it's not low calorie it's a really large meal but you're providing all the
nutrients but you're not eating so frequently so that's how you handle the
fat grams ok so healthy is providing thoughts on vitamins amino acids so you
need moderate amount of protein and you need minerals from vegetables large
amounts of vegetables ok and then you need to lower your carbohydrates bring
it down is too close as zero as possible now it's really hard to do that without
being on a carnivore diet eating just pure fat and protein ok because we need
vegetables we need vegetables to actually supply the roughage and the
fiber for your microbes we need the vegetables for the vitamin C the
potassium so I'm gonna recommend you keepin the vegetables leafy greens but
don't count those as your carbs because they're mostly fiber so you don't have
to worry about that so you can do high quality meats and chicken and fish and
things like that even high quality pork because that has very low carb if
anything and then you can also do all the vegetables and also the butter or
the coconut oil and the fats not a problem where are you going to run into
a little more carbs is the nuts okay if you're trying to really lose weight as
fast as possible you don't want to consume any nuts because they have the
carbs now as far as eggs go I mean you have about what half of
gram of carb per egg so it's very small so I would not worry about that because
normally when you're getting someone in ketosis you're balancing out between 20
and 50 grams but now we're going even lower just for the the purpose of
speeding it up a little fast not necessarily long-term but you want to
just do a jump start we want to bring those carbs way down there olives have a
little bit of carbs but they're really good fats avocado have a little bit of
car but I think it's 13 grams so you could avoid those to really speed things
up and then put it back in once you get close to your goal but my point is to
make this healthy we have to provide all the nutrients and not necessarily just
from a pill from the food so vegetables are essential okay
healthy fats are essential intermittent fasting is essential high quality
protein a moderate amount is essential so the answer to this question is fast
weight loss healthy it really depends on how you do it thanks for watching

now apparently keto now causes bone loss and this is based on a study that was done which
i'm going to cover a woman on my youtube channel brought this up and she was a bit concerned if she
should start keto because she's going through menopause and the last thing she needs is
to lose her bones all right let's go through the actual study i'm going to put a link down
below so you can read it as well there's a couple red flags about this study number one
the study wasn't done on random people it was done on 30 world-class professional endurance athletes
and it was only done for three weeks that's the time the study that they used to determine that
keto causes bone loss of course the media is going to pick this up and run with it now what
do you have to realize with an athlete especially a world-class athlete is that their bodies are
usually carb burning machines they're used to it and if you're going to adapt to the ketogenic diet
and start oxidizing fat that's going to take a lot more than three weeks
especially when you're an athlete if you take an average person who's
sedentary it might be three days but when you're actively pushing your body
hardcore an endurance athlete is constantly tapping out their glycogen reserve and if they
don't replace it they can literally pass out and so the enzymes and the mechanism and the machinery
of adapting to burning fat could take months and on other studies which the long distance
runners are doing keto it takes literally a year or two of training until the point where their
fat burning machines are oxidizing fat in fact their bodies can burn three times as much fat
than anyone else it's quite incredible there's also two ultra marathon runners that i know one
was at my summit and these guys run 100 miles and both of them are keto i'll put a link down below
all right now in the study it showed impaired bone modeling and remodeling but it didn't show
a loss of bone mineral density or strength okay that's a big difference so really the only thing
that showed up was impaired bone modeling and remodeling that does not mean osteoporosis that
does not mean osteopenia but the biggest red flag i think of the entire study is they didn't include
what the diet was was it really keto was it dirty keto did they have enough vitamin k2 which
builds bone did they have enough vitamin d3 what about calcium or even vitamin c
we don't know because they didn't list what they ate and so the bill bone you need the combination
of all those vitamins and minerals and you got to keep your stress low and your hormones in check
on the flip side i'm going to put a link down below of a long-term study
12 months performed on menopausal women which indicated no effect on bone thanks for watching
and you know if you see studies like this in the news read them before you jump to any conclusions

hey guys today we're going to talk about fasting and gallstones this is based on
a very interesting study right here which I I'm gonna put a link down below
first thing to know is that gallstones are created by two conditions one is a
super concentrated amount of cholesterol with low amounts of bile because bile
naturally breaks down cholesterol so if you don't have enough bile then you get
this formation of cholesterol that then can crystallize into stones this study
involved nine healthy women where they extracted bile from the duodenum which
is the first part of the small intestine at ten hour fast fifteen hour fast and
20 hour fast and they were looking at the saturation index okay so the more
saturated the more risk of getting a gallstone so this is what they found a
significant greater saturation at fifteen hours compared to ten hours now
if you're just reading this you're gonna go oh my gosh fasting does increase your
risk of getting a golf jump well if you keep reading the article you'll also
notice that they said this however at twenty hours it reverted okay it
reverted so I'm just gonna read the last part the conclusion in conclusion our
findings suggest that fasting between ten and twenty hours may indeed increase
the risk of gallstone formation but this effect is countered by a more prolonged
fast now there's a couple other points that they mentioned that I need to talk
about number one it looked like the gallbladder stopped concentrating at a
certain point when the person's fasting so in other words in your mind you might
think that if you wanna fast the gallbladder is gonna keep concentrating
and concentrating and concentrating the bile in the gallbladder and creating a
stone but they're observing that the body actually stops concentrating the
certain point also number two they mentioned that there might be some
emptying of the gallbladder during the fast and
then replacing with a less concentrated amount of bile and also one last thing I
want to mention the diet that they were on included about 95 grams of
carbohydrates now in keto were only recommending 20 to 50 grams we do know
that insulin does increase risk of gall stones cortisol will increase risk of
gall stones estrogen will increase the risk of gallstones naturally if using
that many carbs that can influence the numbers I'd be very curious if they did
this study with someone being on a ketogenic plan to see what would happen
but for my experience working with a tremendous amount of people and also
reading a lot of the reviews I don't think I've ever heard anyone mention
that they developed gallstones from doing fasting and healthy keto thanks
for watching
We're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you
have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and

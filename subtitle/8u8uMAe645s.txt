you know you really don't know having a quality extra virgin olive oil until you tasted it so for
years i've been consuming olive oil thinking it's the real thing um not knowing any difference um
until i actually tasted some really good olive oil and i was like what the heck is this this is
completely different than the bland stuff that i would get at walmart or a grocery store in
the u.s when you actually taste a high quality extra virgin olive oil you'll definitely notice
the difference and the reason why you need to consume extra virgin olive oil like the real thing
is because it has some exceptional health benefits and i recently did a video on the
anti-inflammatory effect of extra virgin olive oil acting as a natural ibuprofen because of the
chemical ulcanthyl which can help you if you have arthritis or bursitis or tendonitis or rheumatoid
arthritis but extra virgin olive oil has some additional vital chemicals that go way beyond just
acting as an anti-inflammatory and the compound called alloropine turns into another compound
called hydroxytrirosol which is 20 times stronger than green tea now of course to get these amazing
phytonutrients with all these great properties you're going to have to get the real deal you're
going to have to get olive oil from spain greece italy morocco france portugal turkey in israel and
you're probably not going to find the kind that you really need in your local u.s grocery store if
you're in the u.s you're probably going to have to order it online from one of these countries or go
to a specialized store to get this but this olive oil is quite amazing for your health i'd highly
recommend putting it on your salad every single day at least two to three or even four ounces
uh it has anti-inflammatory effects anti-microbial effects anti-thrombotic effects it helps you prevent
clotting okay thins the blood it also has anti-atherogenic properties which prevent the
formation of plaquing like that cholesterol calcium plaquing it has retinol protective
properties which protects against the retina in your eye as well as anti-cancer properties
and it can protect you from uv radiation and i think the best way to identify if it's the real
deal is through its intense flavor and aroma hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

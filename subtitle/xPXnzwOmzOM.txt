hey dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you how to get rid of
kidney stones many years ago I personally had kidney
stones and I will never forget how much pain that is so it's excruciating so I'm
going to show you first of all what causes them and then what to do about
them first of all in the blood with the chemistry in your body if it's not right
you can set your body up to build build up the crystals of calcium they're
called oxalate stones it's a combination of oxalates in calcium so there are
other causes there's other types of stones but the most common one is the
calcium oxalate stones and that has to do with in your blood you have low
citrates and basically citrates help you prevent kidney stones they help
combine with excess calcium and remove it safely from the body so if you don't
have citrates what will happen and you'll start to build up more crystals that
develop in the tiny little tubules of your kidney and develop stones okay and
the number 2 high oxalate foods now what foods are high oxalate number 1 dark
beer cruciferous which I recommend like kale broccoli Brussels sprouts cabbage
chocolate fruit soy beans beets spinach and all these are high in oxalate so the
combination of this and this is not good but then if you're taking anti acids
that's a problem especially if it's calcium based because you're driving and
a lot of calcium into the body that it can't deal with so it's going to get
stuck in the kidney and that's a soft tissue calcium that builds up and then
calcium itself calcium supplements you want to make sure you never consumed
calcium carbonate in your body so you want to look at your vitamins and see is
the ingredients calcium carbonate that's the worst type of calcium that's like
taking rocks you'd be better off chewing on the cement outside because it's
basically just like oyster shells or it's not sending our body can digest
easily there's like 12 steps it takes to be able to assimilate
and for most people it just gets stuck in the in the in your kidney so we don't
recommend taking a lot of calcium and just as a side note about calcium if you
are menopausal and you're female and you want to prevent osteoporosis and maybe
you have high blood pressure you have any type of soft-tissue calcium like
stiffness I created a video on that one thing soft tissue calcium it's very
important you can click below and find it it's about vitamin k2 very important
to kind of remove the excess calcium so we have calcium which is a whole
different topic and then sugar sugar depletes excess calcium and that can go
through the kidney out of the blood and get stuck in your kidney too so sugar is
not a good combination and then sodium now sodium chloride that would be salt
but I'm not talking about sea salt I'm talking about sodium just in the junk
food that people eat growing up I was a teenager I would consume a bag of
Doritos in one sitting the mega huge packs and of course that was way too
much sodium and that can create a problem and also hidden sodium is
monosodium glutamate so the combination is not good to develop stones to prevent
stones here's what you do about it it's very very simple we want to increase our
citrates by consuming citric acid from lemon juice okay go to the health food
store and get lemon juice get the if you can get the organic lemon juice that
would be really really good that just has lemon and water that would be
awesome and you want to consume like 1 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice in your
water throughout the day ok you can do lime juice if you want and I like to add
a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to that just to put that additional factor
into your drink to really help clean out any calcium that builds up so the
combination of lemon and apple cider vinegar with water is really good to
prevent and also fix kidney stones if you have them all right and then if you
have any of these issues too you might need to fix your stomach I have videos
on how to fix heartburn and then soft
tissue calcium and how to get rid of your
sugar cravings so I have a lot of other videos so if you found this beneficial

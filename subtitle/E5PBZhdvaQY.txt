so let's talk about a fatty liver specifically non-alcoholic fatty liver disease the reason why
i wanted to do this video is simply because 25% of the world population i'm talking about adults
has this disease in fact 40 percent of the u.s population talking about adults
has nafld it's extremely extremely common but guess what there's no symptoms in most cases
now there's two types of this disease one type you just have the fat only and the other
type is with the fat and the inflammation now here's the problem with having a fatty liver
the symptoms don't occur right away they take many years because the fat can then obstruct uh certain
things in the in the liver like the mitochondria that then lead to inflammation that then leads to
insulin resistance and then more insulin more fat and then scar tissue so we go from a fatty
liver to a fatty inflamed liver to cirrhosis and then you need a liver transplant now the problem
with the fatty liver is the long-term effects and no symptoms until later so you might not
take action to change your diet until you have symptoms because a lot of people are walking
around thinking well i have time i'll just wait it's not a problem everything shows up normal
on blood tests and then one day they start seeing high liver enzymes and start having problems and
that's when they change but by that time it could be a little too late now they are trying to change
the name of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to m-a-f-l-d which stands for metabolic dysfunction
associated with fatty liver disease and the reason why they're trying to do that is this right here
metabolic dysfunction which is really related to metabolic syndrome syndrome x where you have high
blood pressure high cholesterol high blood glucose central obesity your fat right through here
which is exclusively caused by insulin but let me just kind of give you a little bit more data about
this 90 percent of obese people have this right here sixty percent of diabetics have this problem
and twenty percent of people with normal weight have this problem
with the majority having insulin resistance so when you look this up and you do research there's
all this confusing information it's it's all disconnected it's not really aligned to an actual
cause-effect relationship in fact one comment was the mechanism of accumulation of triglycerides
that's the fat that's accumulating in the liver is complex and incompletely understood
so this confusion only occurs if you don't know the definition the functional definition
of the word insulin i mean if you just take a look in any basic endocrinology textbook
under the chapter of insulin you'll quickly understand that insulin converts glucose to
triglycerides that's what's causing this it's high levels of insulin what causes a high level
of insulin is carbohydrates especially fructose and omega 6 fatty acids i'm talking about the
vegetable oils the soy oil canola corn oil cottonseed oil
that can lead to insulin resistance and raise the insulin and create this problem as well
now if we take a look at non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic fatty liver disease
two different causes but same damage same effect so in other words fructose and omega-6 fatty acids
and other refined carbohydrates have a very similar effect to alcohol
on the liver you would think that alcohol creates the most damage but not necessarily because this
condition is so common chances are some of you watching have this issue and if you're new in my
channel it's very very easy to reverse it all you have to do is you have to understand the mechanism
and get on the right eating plant i put a link down below of exactly what you should do and then
in two or three months from now i would highly recommend going back getting a real evaluation
to see the change all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

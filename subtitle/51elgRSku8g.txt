let's talk about the best foods for bad breath one of the biggest problems with bad breath is
overgrowth of certain bacteria in your mouth in your esophagus in your sinuses it also could be
an overgrowth of yeast or even candida on your tongue and these microbes actually live on
sugar so one of the most important things to do is to stop eating sugar okay because
that way you can starve these guys and that includes milk sugar okay for milk products
now the absolute biggest problem and the reason why people have this overgrowth
it starts with this right here antibiotics once you have too many antibiotics you start to kill
off the good and you have this overgrowth of the bad and so many people end up with
all sorts of chronic halitosis bad body odor because of this right here now there are certain
conditions where your liver can be damaged and you can have either a fruity musty odor
or kind of a ammonia type smelling breath that's a little different here's here's the best foods
though number one chlorophyll foods chlorophyll is the green stuff in plants chlorophyll
is a natural deodorizer and when you consume certain vegetables that are more bitter than
others like radish arugula kale endive dandelion you actually have additional things that can
actually help your liver as well so you can kill two birds one stone you can get the chlorophyll
as well as the phytonutrients to support the liver okay so this is like number one number
two probiotic foods i would recommend not getting your probiotics from like yogurt or kefir do it
non-dairy why because there's a little bit of milk sugar that can feed the yeast candida or bacteria
sauerkraut would be probably the best thing kimchi would be good or fermented vegetables pickles
things like that you can even do kombucha tea and even pickle juice actually can help you but the
more you can build up these friendly bacteria the more you can kind of counter the effect of this
and actually will help reduce the the unfriendly bacteria don't go crazy with too much protein
a lot of people who have bad breath consume a tremendous amount of protein
a lot of carbs a lot of sugar and nothing with chlorophyll okay you don't want to do that you
want to do moderate protein just between maybe three to six to seven maybe eight ounces per meal
of protein all right number four quality of food very important especially if you want good breath
you want to have organic food you want to have not commercial meats you want to have grass-fed
all of that is going to help you even let's let's take for example uh salad dressing like
extra virgin olive oil versus soy oil or canola oil way way way better so make sure we go for
quality on that as well mint tea spearmint tea there's a lot of different ones even green tea
that will greatly help someone if they're trying to overcome this bad breath situation

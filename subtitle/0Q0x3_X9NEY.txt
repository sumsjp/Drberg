i want to talk about the importance of vitamin d with your hair there's a huge association between
hair loss and low vitamin d levels let me tell you why because right beneath your skin okay so
you can see your hair right here but right beneath the skin there is something called the follicle
and that's kind of part of the root and on that root area you have sebaceous glands which
produce an oil and like a waxy substance that goes into the hair that protects the hair there's
also antibacterial things in there and it does a lot of other things but both the sebaceous gland
and the follicle which is right deep in the skin have vitamin d receptors okay now there's various
growth stages of your hair and there's one called anagen and this is the new hair growth stage it's
the first stage from follicle to the full grown hair and this stage is dependent on vitamin d and
so that follicle that actually is an organ now you think about organs as like the heart the liver the
kidney but your follicle is an organ too and this little organ underneath the skin has 20 different
cell types that regulate the growth of the hair and there's all sorts of hormonal involvement
immune cell involvement and certain proteins that help regulate this hair and what they found with
people that have hair loss and a type of hair loss called alopecia which is an autoimmune condition
where you have patches of hair falling out there's been a higher level of mutations with vitamin d
and i'm talking about the receptor for vitamin d it's called the vdr the vitamin d receptor
if you haven't seen my video on this i put a link down below but what happens with a certain percent
of the population is they have this variant or this alteration in the vitamin d receptor
this mutation that can actually also spread to your offspring as well but this mutation
doesn't allow a person to absorb vitamin d and so if they're taking the normal amount about md
or getting a certain amount of sun it doesn't work and all of a sudden they start losing their hair
and what they should do is take more vitamin d minimally 10,000 IUs of vitamin d and
in my video you'll see i also recommend bio salts which can also activate the vitamin d receptor
if there's a problem with this mutation anyway the point about this video is to make people aware on
the significance of vitamin d in relationship to your hair and if you are losing hair
don't forget about vitamin d hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

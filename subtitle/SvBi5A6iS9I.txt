today i'm going to talk about some
simple home tests that you can do
to determine if you may have adrenal
fatigue
now i'm going to tell you right up front
medically they don't recognize adrenal
fatigue
you know they do recognize that there
are adrenal dysfunction
diseases like addison's disease where
your body's not producing
any more adrenal hormones on the flip
side you have cushing's disease which
you're pumping out a lot of cortisol so
it's a hyper
cortisol situation but my question is
why can't you have
different problems in between you don't
just wake up one day with addison's
disease or cushing's syndrome
they start at a certain point and
gradually get worse
but medically they don't recognize these
in between conditions or shall we say
subclinical versions of these problems
and i think probably one of the reasons
it's very hard to diagnose
because it doesn't show up on a blood
test so since the adrenal glands are
intimately involved with the autonomic
nervous system i'm going to show you
several tests you can do at home to kind
of get a clue on what's going on with
your autonomic nervous system i'm
talking about the sympathetic nervous
system which is the flight of fight and
then the parasympathetic nervous system
which is rest and digest and so first
let's just mention the symptoms with
adrenal fatigue okay you have insomnia
that's a big one you have dizziness when
you stand up too fast okay
you have brain fog
you have low tolerance to stress you
cannot tolerate stress as well as you
used to you might have low libido you
may have allergies or asthma
your immune system is poor you may get
sick
easily because your resistance is on the
low side you may have inflammation
because when you run out of the adrenal
function you lose that those powerful
anti-inflammatories
and then you end up with inflammatory
conditions so anything that says itis
is an inflammatory condition and you may
have poor focus because with the
adrenals you're kind of scattered you're
all over the place you're solving
problems 24 7 and so it's very difficult
to put your attention on one thing over
a period of time without shifting to
another topic so that relates to
completing things you might start a lot
of things but you just don't complain
because you get distracted now the
adrenals are two little glands sitting
on top of the kidney deep inside your
abdomen
and they respond to stress they help
your body
respond to stress states so they adapt
all these different body functions
to a stress situation now the problem
nowadays is that a lot of people are
under a chronic stress they're not
necessarily being chased by a tiger but
they are feeling like they're being
chased by a tiger 24 7 because they have
mental stress and the challenge is if
you have all this mental stress without
the physical way of releasing the stress
you're not running away from anything
you're just sitting there
the stress can build up and it can
affect your sleep it can affect a lot of
different things so let's go through
seven
home tests okay the first one is called
raglans very simple test
you need a blood pressure cuff and you
need a piece of paper and a pen okay
what you're going to do is you're going
to take your blood pressure lying down
while you're relaxed and you're going to
record that and then you're going to
stand up right away and recheck your
blood pressure now normally the top
number called the systolic should go up
by 6 to 10
points
but with adrenal fatigue
it's going to either
go down
or it's going to go really really high
and i've seen it both situations so when
you stand up you should normally have
this certain amount of adaptation
and so if there's no adaptation
mechanism like adrenals are weak your
blood pressure might crash down like i
know 10 points
20 points
i've seen it 30 points so you when you
stand up when your blood pressure drops
that much that is a major adrenal issue
so you can kind of get an indication of
how bad your adrenals are
by what happens to your blood pressure
so that's one test okay the second test
is the iris test another name for that
if you wanted to know is called this
paradoxical pupillary response test
so you're really looking at the
autonomic nervous system control as far
as the muscles that allow light in the
eye now if you ever look at the eye when
you go from a dark room to maybe a
bright light
your body's going to restrict the excess
light going into the eye if you're out
in the sun and you're looking up
your
pupil is going to constrict okay so it's
going to lessen the amount of light into
the eye so you're first going to get
your eyes used to the dark okay for
maybe
i don't know about maybe a minute or so
okay and you're going to be next to a
mirror so you don't want to shine the
light directly in the eye
shine it slightly to the side
and
when you shine the light into the eye
you're looking with your other eye what
occurs with the eye that you're shining
lighting to normally when you shine
light into the eye it should constrict
and the constricted pupil the little
black little hole in the center
should maintain that constriction for at
least 30 seconds okay but if the adrenal
glands are weak
because you have the sympathetic nervous
system and the parasympathetic playing
tug of war
on your eyes
then you're going to notice that you're
not going to be able to maintain that
constriction you can see a couple things
you might see
that the eye kind of goes up up and down
like
back and forth okay i've seen that or
you might see that
it's constricted then within 10 seconds
it starts to vasodilate get bigger
so if it's not maintaining this
constricted state while you're holding
the light okay into the eye then there
could be some adrenal weakness involved
all right test number three is pretty
simple this one you're just going to
hold your breath okay you're going to
completely hold your breath you can put
your your um your fingers over your nose
and you can just hold your breath
normally if the adrenal glands are are
good you should be able to hold your
breath for at least 40 seconds
but
the worse your adrenals are the less you
can hold your breath you may find that
you're only able to hold your breath for
10 seconds or 15 seconds or 20 seconds
and you're gasping for air
that could indicate that the adrenal
glands are weak because if your body's
in a stress state um you just cannot
hold on to uh air that long test number
four basically you're going to just
observe how you recover after exercise
okay because
adrenal fatigue cases don't
recover after exercise too well now you
can check your pulse rate before during
and after the exercise
and if the adrenal glands are weak the
pulse rate just will not come down it
kind of stays higher for a longer period
of time or you can just subjectively um
sense how you feel after you work out
normally if the adrenal glands are good
you're going to recover after exercise
but if your adrenal glands are weak
it's going to take a long time to
recover you're going to be sore after
exercise it might take days before you
recover
so your recovery has a lot to do with
your adrenal function let's go to number
five your ability to tolerate
stress and you are the best person to
judge for that the question is can you
tolerate stress can you be there
comfortably without being irritable or
flying off the handle
okay or breaking down if you can't
tolerate stress that well
chances are your adrenals are not coping
all right number six your ability to
handle inclines like climbing up a hill
going upstairs
uh any any type of exercise where you're
doing inclines is going to be pretty bad
if your adrenal glands are fatigued
because simply you're stressing the
adrenal in fact you may find just by
standing up you get dizzy or you faint
so that's just for adrenal function and
lastly number seven a really good test
to determine what's going on with your
adrenals is just how long you sleep
you get up in the middle of the night
specifically around two o'clock a.m then
we know cortisol could be involved or
can you go to sleep
maintain a comfortable sleep and wake up
feeling refreshed that's a real good
indication to
tell you if you have healthy adrenals or
not now the best next video for you to
watch is what to eat if you have adrenal
fatigue and i put that up right here
check it out

hey guys i have another tip on fatigue
on keto okay let's see your tire doing
keto like what could that be
it could be low b vitamins specifically
b1
and b5 to handle that you would need
nutritional yeast
nutritional yeast and electrolytes
pretty much are your basic
nutrition that you should be doing when
you're doing keto and intermittent
fasting because your
cells need more of those two nutrients
or
those group of nutrients the next thing
is this let's say for example
you are tired and then you eat and you
feel more energetic
that's usually a low blood sugar
situation in which you need to add a
little more protein
a little more fat and give it more time
let's say you're tired right after you
eat okay that's high sugar
so that means that you maybe either have
hidden carbs and you're eating
something you shouldn't maybe like
you're combining some hidden
source of let's say you're doing chips
or something you're eating has sugar in
it that could do it it could be
that it's just going to be some time
before you correct the insulin
resistance situation

hi guys dr. Berg here no time for exercise well you want to try this okay it's called
the Tabata protocol and this is what it involves eight sets of 20-second workouts
if you actually calculate that that's only two and a half minutes of actual exercise
can you set that into your schedule you can ten seconds rest in between the workouts okay
real simple four times per week not even every day so here's the catch-22 it has to be super
intense full-body workout could be burpees mountain climbers battling ropes spin bike
kettlebell okay so but it has to involve the whole body of a hight intense nature only two
and a half minutes of actual workout so you can do this the results on this are spectacular I'm
going to put some some links down below and you can check it out but I want you to go ahead and
start doing this if you don't have time squeeze this into your busy schedule thanks for watching

let's talk about what would happen if you stopped eating fast food for one week now i want to go
beyond just carbohydrates and sugar i've done so many videos on that if you stop eating carbs and
sugar we know all the benefits that are going to occur i'll put some links down below if you
haven't seen that video because i mean you're going to help prevent a fatty liver you're going
to lose a lot of weight you're going to have cognitive changes all sorts of wonderful things
just for the fact that you cut down your carbs and your sugars but what else is in fast food that if
you eliminate it would benefit you well number one when you eat processed foods refined foods
you are eating foods very low in nutrients anytime you eat empty calories or foods that are void in
nutrition you end up depleting your reserves of vitamins and minerals specifically b1 calcium
zinc other b vitamins and that creates a whole series of issues right there also when you consume
empty calories or refined foods you don't get any phytonutrients so you have a situation where
you have no antioxidants and a lot of oxidation and you have a lot of damage in the body just
from oxidation alone from free radical damage because these phytonutrients protect i mean
so many things your heart the inside layer of your arteries the kidneys the eyes
the brain the nerves so without those phytonutrients or antioxidants you tend to get
things like peripheral neuropathy where you get tingling and burning in your toes you start to
have vision problems kidney problems heart issues and the list goes on and on but there's something
else i want to talk about there are a lot of food additives in fast food preservatives colorings
things that enhance the texture of the food the thickness of certain sauces and things you have
sweeteners you have artificial sweeteners but the one that i want to focus on now is things that
enhance the flavors okay and primarily i'm talking about msg monosodium glutamate also known as
modified food starch which is in so many foods so why are they putting a flavor enhancer in
food in the first place what are they trying to cover up if you didn't have msg in this fast food
what would it really taste like you probably would be shocked you probably wouldn't eat it
and as far as the topic of msg if you do research on it you're going to find very wide viewpoints
some people say it's good some people say it's bad and so you have this conflicting viewpoint
you don't know who to believe because you'll see research on both sides my whole thought on that is
that unless you really have first-hand knowledge and you experiment with it yourself or on
close friends that you know and you can see the results um you don't really know for sure however
that being said um just from being in practice for 30 years i have found that whatever
the general consensuses of the mainstream thought i tend to look in the opposite direction and
i don't trust that viewpoint because there's so much vested interest involved and so i tend to go
in the other direction but what i will tell you about msg from personal observation i don't get
the reactions that the allergies the sensitivities but what i get is incredible pleasure it tastes
good initially but then about an hour and a half later i am starving so i know for a fact
through personal firsthand observation that it increases hunger and it will cause me to keep
eating especially when you go to a thai restaurant or a chinese restaurant or just see
like doritos for example which in college i lived on doritos and a lot of other junk foods so i have
a lot of experience in this area and i also know it retains fluid because when i consume that food
i'm so thirsty and then i end up finding that i can't even get my ring off or my ankles get puffy
now currently i don't do any msg i'm talking about in my early 20s when i had a lot of experience in
doing junk foods and so here's my viewpoint if you were to cut out fast food for one week
you're gonna notice your hunger goes away you'll be able to go from one meal to the
next much easier especially if you're doing keto in intermittent fasting you're going to notice
your cravings are going to drop which then makes it very easy to stick to a plan also your fluid
retention will greatly improve you'll get rid of a lot of fluid you you'll probably pee a lot more
for about two weeks you're going to find your mind is clear your cognitive function is much better
you're going to feel like your body is overall cleaner you're not going to feel so groggy you're
not going to get the brain fog you're going to have definitely more energy and then you'll start
losing fat actual fat but that doesn't happen right away that's a little bit delayed one or two
weeks and so if you eat a lot of fast food and by the way back then no one could have convinced me
not to do fast foods i was highly addicted i had to hit bottom before i changed but maybe you are
different and a bit wiser so try to give up fast food just for one week to prove it to yourself so
you can have first-hand knowledge that it will very much benefit you in many different levels

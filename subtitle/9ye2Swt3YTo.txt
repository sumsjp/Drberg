hi guys dr. Berg here I had another question about bentonite clay another word is montmorillonite
okay so what is it it's a volcanic ash type clay product that is filled with all sorts of
trace minerals but the unique thing is it gains a super strong negative charge when
you add water so in chemistry you have all these molecules that are either positively
charged or negatively charged bentonite clay is negatively charged when you add water so
it acts as a kind of like a magnet not like a sponge but a magnet so there's this word
called adsorption not absorption adsorption which basically attracts things around the
molecule okay bentonite clay will attract up to 2,000 times its weight because it attracts all
these positively charged particles like heavy metals and other toxins that are in your liver
and your system so when you do a detox cleanse either kidney cleanse or liver cleanse it's
super important to consume this to be able to take all this toxic material and safely
pull it out of the body so it's great for liver and kidney cleanses it's also good for facial
masks you can add charcoal with it and put it on your skin and it'll actually help pull out toxins
and because the trace minerals are there it's going to actually saturate the body with great
nutrients also it's good for other skin problems like poison ivy eczema psoriasis so basically
that's the simplicity of what bentonite clay is thanks for watching hey you probably already

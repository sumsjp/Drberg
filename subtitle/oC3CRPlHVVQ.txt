hello in this video we're going to talk about vitamin B4 now does anyone ever tell you the
first B vitamin that we've ever discovered can you have any wild guesses its b1 then comes B
2 then B 3 and then before ok and the name of b4 is adenine so what does it do it basically
helps prevent nerve paralysis or a loss of nerve conductivity primarily to the heart the research
was actually done on pigeons by the way now also when you have this loss of nerve conductivity
you're going to have a loss of coordination of the muscles of the heart and there's four parts
of the heart you have to primer pumps in two major pumps their ventricles and they all have to be in
coordination so when you have a deficiency before you get this loss of coordination so if you look
at a heart graph you'll see a split sound or a delay in the heart sound the eventual end result
of chronic b4 deficiency is fibrillation and the last function of before if it prevents in our
large heart so if you don't have the nerve flow to the muscle its loses tone and in the in the chest
it starts sagging and if you look at an x-ray it looks it's getting bigger because it's lost tone
and when you lose tone the valves open up and you get leaky valves and that's murmurs okay
what causes a vitamin b4 deficiency is refined flour products in the form of bread pasta cereal
crackers biscuits waffles pancakes and also refined sugar so the way you would get vitamin
B4 is nutritional yeast okay thanks for watching so this Thursday night I'm doing another live Q&A

okay so we're at part two of breaking bad old
habits okay this video is about increasing your awareness
of carbs okay certain carbs um like this carb right here cupcakes i used to love these things
i used to eat this whole box like in one sitting no problem without even thinking of it they're
delicious i mean the packaging is incredible right so let's take a look at what's in this product
all right number one we have this thing right here you know what that is right that's the first
ingredient sugar we have flour and then we have high fructose corn syrup palm oil then we have
more corn syrup cocoa soy bean oil tallow beef fat fascinating they put that in there glycerin cocoa
processed with alkali modified corn starch so they have corn starch refined corn okay definitely gmo
a little glyphosate on that and then we have uh baking soda baking soda right here salt
corn starch so we have modified corn starch and corn starch we'll come back to that
dextrose whey hydrogenated tallow
so they're basically making taylor into trans fats i thought that was banned okay inulin that's
a fiber egg calcium carbonate that's limestone and then we have sorbic acid potassium sorbate
calcium sulfate egg whites mono and diglycerides you heard of a triglyceride this is a digless ribe
okay so then we have xantham gum soy lecithin cellulose gum locus bean gum that's all going to
give it the texture that you need monocalcium phosphate titanium dioxide for the coloring
see you got coloring in there you have to have it certain colors right
um disodium phosphate sunflower oil chocolate liqueur and defatted soy flour so those are the
ingredients in the right combination to give you the right sweetness texture color and flavor right
now here's the problem let's take a look at this nutritional label right here
okay we have 170 calories all right so now there's eight servings so all of these calories and things
right here are based on one of those servings so you have to multiply all these by eight if
you're gonna eat the whole thing which i always did and it's really difficult to have just one
but let's start off with the calories 170 okay so let's say we we just four today and we'll eat
the rest tomorrow okay 680 calories it's going to take you about an hour of jogging to burn that off
so that's probably not going to happen with most people that are consuming this type of food
so what's happening we're cramming all this fuel into the body okay without burning it off
very dangerous we'll come back to that now let's take a look first at the fat grams
is six grams it's eight percent of this is fat then we get sodium 240 milligrams 10 10
wait a second now there's no way that 10 of this is going to be actual salt and
they actually don't even say salt they say sodium there's a lot of other sodium in this
product now where could that be could there be some monosodium glutamate
i don't know i don't know maybe it's hidden as modified cornstarch and that would make it more
delicious because if 10 of this was actual salt sodium chloride it would be too salty when you
consume more sodium without the chloride it's not very salty it's definitely going to retain fluid
but not very salty okay carbs 29 grams that's 11 of this product is carbohydrates one gram of fiber
okay if we deduct that it's 28 net carbs and then we get to the sugars
if we add the sugars plus added sugar that's 19 grams now if we multiply the well 29 minus one
that's 28 grams of carbs times four that's a hundred and twelve grams of carbs okay
it's way way way too much now here's the problem when we combine refined fat with refined sugar
it starts to create a compound which is i'm going to give you a word here it's glycated which means
it's kind of stuck together and it's act it lacks like glue in the body and it plugs everything up
you know the same thing happens when you add a protein with sugar okay so that's one thing i
don't want to get into that at this point but i do want to say if you eat fat with refined sugar
the body is going to metabolize the refined sugar as a priority over the fat and the fat is
going to be left unburned unoxidized that's right so unoxidized fat increases the risk
of insulin resistance and if you've been watching my videos you know what happens with that it all
goes downhill from there now what we're doing is we're going to cram all this fuel from fat sugar
together and jam it into the mitochondria that's the machine that is supposed to burn the fuel but
apparently most people that are eating these type of foods they're not exercising a lot they're not
burning off these calories so you're going to get a lot of excess fuel cram down the mitochondria
without burning it you're going to get so many free radicals so much oxidants and the problem is
these refined fats and refined sugars don't have the antioxidants to counter that
okay so we get a lot of damage without any protection of these free radicals now
unfortunately there's about five tissues in your body that don't have a lot of antioxidants it's
because your body does make antioxidants like glutathione sod catalase and there's many other
ones but these five tissues don't normally have as many antioxidants as other tissues so
we're talking about the retina that's in the eye the inside of the artery the brain
your nerves the kidney cell and the beta cell in the pancreas that makes
insulin so what happens is you get a lot of extra damage to these five tissues
when you overload the system with that much fuel and create that much oxidation
and free radicals and this is the typical pattern of a diabetic so the real dangerous situation
in this scenario is too much fuel producing too much damage without any ability to protect itself
from that damage so then the body develops insulin resistance as a protective mechanism
but the problem with that that leads to a whole series of other issues so this video
is really about increasing your awareness about certain carbohydrates what it does to the cells
especially if you're doing all these carbs without being able to burn them off at the same time
very very dangerous and also the consequences of what happens and hopefully that
may motivate certain people to start to make changes that they wouldn't normally do
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

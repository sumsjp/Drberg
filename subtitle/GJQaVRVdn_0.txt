hello in this video we're going to talk about how fat gets burned okay now when
you think about fat burning there's no real burning going on it's basically the
release of fat from the fat cell that gets turned into energy okay I'm going
to just talk about the mechanics of actually what happens your fat cell is
primarily stored with triglycerides okay those are fats and they're in a liquid
state so your fat is basically liquid it's not a solid and what happens is
that there's an enzyme called hormone sensitive lipase it's an enzyme now
enzymes are proteins that help chemical changes occur in the body they're like
the workhorse they're like the worker bee that does the work in the body
they're kind of magical because they can go in there and change and break down
proteins and build them back up break down fat and build and back up into body
tissue so lipase is the primary enzyme that releases the stored fat in the fat
cell and it's a hormone sensitive which means it's triggered by certain hormone
okay so now that we know that lipase is the enzyme now the real question is what
triggers let's pace okay there's certain things that trigger it
and number one we're going to use this little book right here guidance
physiology on page 927 it says insulin inhibits the action of hormone sensitive
lipase okay so if this is the burning of fact or the releasing effect and insulin
is there it will inhibit this it will stop it
number two insulin promotes glucose transport into the fat cell so basically
in the presence of insulin it's going to actually cause storage into the fat cell
okay so far insulin is not good for losing weight right but here's what I
want talking about therefore when infant is not available to promote glucose
entry into the fat cell that storage is almost completely blocked okay all
aspects of fat metabolism are greatly enhanced in the absence
of insulin okay so it's really the absence of insulin and triggers lipase
that's the trigger all right so cutting out the carbs not
eating so frequently those are the two big ones
number two fasting so fasting is another trigger for this enzyme intermittent
fasting why because every time you eat you trigger insulin right another one
adrenaline from exercise so exercise will trigger the lipase enzyme to help
you dissolve fat growth hormone is another trigger for lipase growth
hormone would be intense exercise sleeping a small amount of protein and
intermittent fasting those are all the triggers for growth on them sigh red
hormones will also trigger lipase okay now sometimes people will say they have
a confusion because they say well insulin resistance is blocking insulin
from getting into the cell stair buddy will have lower insulin and will lose
weight but that's not what happens because when you have insulin resistance
and sends a signal to the pancreas forcing the pancreas to make five to
seven times more insulin so insulin resistance is actually too much insulin
because of the overcompensation that's occuring it's a real important point
that you need to know so we have this release of fat from the fat cell partly
we got triglycerides fatty acids that can be used for energy in the muscle but
also a lot of it's just converted through the liver into ketones which is
used for energy so that's where we get the ketosis so the question is would a
low calorie diet trigger lipase okay well not necessarily not if you have
carbs in your diet too many carbs and you're triggering insulin so this will
just kind of help you understand like what diets will work what diets won't
well a high-fat diet cause the release of the fat well not necessarily because
high fat does not inhibit insulin you can still be eating carbs and fat at the
same time fasting well that's not eating anything
exercise growth hormone so high fat is not the trigger it's something that you
want to consume because it's it's kind of not going to trigger insulin too much
but it's not the main trigger low fat diet is is that going to help trigger
the release of this no because there is no when you do a low fat diet that's not
a trigger to this enzyme at all it's not gonna help you lose weight with a
high-protein diet cause this trigger no because high protein doesn't trigger
enemies with a vegan diet trigger lipase no because you can be eating a lot of
carbs it really depends on your insulin level if you're doing intimate fasting
exercise growth hormone and thyroid hormone avoiding saturated fat is that
can help you lose weight no it's not going to help you lose weight at all so
the point is that this is how fast burn through this enzyme these are the
triggers and that's the simplicity of it thanks for watching

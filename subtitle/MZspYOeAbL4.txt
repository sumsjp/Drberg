hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you how to fix carpal
tunnel syndrome okay check this out okay guys so if someone has carpal tunnel
syndrome let's say she has carpal tunnel on the left wrist okay
the way we're going to fix this is we're going to work on the opposite wrist
that's right this is completely different than what most people do so
you don't want to work on the actual opposite wrist we want to work on the
muscles that attach to the wrist both on the front side and the back side and I
know you're going to be asking what if you have carpal tunnel on both sides
I'll get to that next but let's pretend it's only on the left and we're going to
actually come and massage these muscles on the opposite side and what you're
going to find is it's going to be very very very very tender on the on the
opposite side and the person is going to go why is that so tender it's just the
way the brain is sending it's sending signals more on this side now because
it's blocked on that side so we're kind of retraining the brain to to neutralize
the pain signals into her left wrist so I'm going to massage all these muscles
right here right up into this elbow very important then I'm going to get on the
outside and work on these muscles right here and you just need to stimulate the
muscles really good and what will happen is this side here I like to have them
move this wrist while I'm doing this okay and then you want to rate first
rate the pain in the side ten being really bad you'll be no pain and then
ask them how does it feel now and they might say a five and I'll say where did
it move and she might say well it's more over here now
okay then I'm going to work on the muscles that oppose that side and work
on those and I'll strip this all the way down through here okay a couple minutes
and then she'll go oh yeah it's getting better and better and then I might have
to do the the inside a little bit more okay so that's a simple technique to fix
carpal tunnel syndrome on one side all right now if it's on both sides what you
have to do is you want to do once at a time usually the side that started
first just pretend that's the worst one you can do the opposite side then I'm
also going to work on this side okay that's going to work about seventy
percent of time okay so that was pretty simple wasn't it so here's your next
step go ahead and apply this to someone else or have them apply to you and post

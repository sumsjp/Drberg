so today we're going to talk about what to do for adhd
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder it's not genetic
okay there's no evidence or proof that this is a genetic problem
in fact this might surprise you but it's not a ritalin deficiency
and from my viewpoint it's not even a mental disease
this is purely a nutritional deficiency the symptoms are low
attention focus you can't focus hyperactivity
restlessness visual learning problems difficulty reading and remembering
now there's a great credible study that i found that i'm going to share down
below it's not an observational study where
they're doing questionnaires it's actually a real study 12-week
double-blinded placebo-controlled trial so check it out and there was
significant improvements in adhd using high doses
of something called epa okay now they actually use a combination of
epa and dha at least 750 milligrams
of this combination every single day for 12 weeks
and this is very easy to find at any health food store or online
and i'm not going to get into any specific brands so you'll have to figure
that out but if you have adhd
you need to be taking this combination right here if you can find one that's
a little heavier in the epa to dha that may work a little bit better now
what is epa and what is dha well
collectively these are the omega-3 fatty acids you have omega-3 fatty acids
and you also have omega-6 fatty acids collectively these are called essential
fatty acids and what that means is that your body
can't make them they must get them from the diet here's the big problem it's
differentiating the importance of omega-3 versus omega
6. they're not of equal importance omega-3 is way more important
than omega-6 yet the ratios of these fats in an average person
is 16-1 okay so that's way too heavy on six in fact over a hundred
million metric tons and a ton is two thousand pounds
is extracted and used in our food supply every single year
versus 4 million metric tons of omega-3 this is what's missing right here
omega-3 fatty acids have anti-psychotic properties they help your
cognitive function they improve your iq there's over 170
genes that have to do just with brain
development they have the potential of increasing
dopamine serotonin and protecting your neurons so if you
can imagine having enough omega-3 for your brain to work
you're not going to have these symptoms right here now as a side note
if you have restlessness or your child has restlessness
or even hyperactivity i would add in there vitamin b1
in the form of nutritional yeast or just some natural b1
because b1 deficiencies will easily cause these
two symptoms right here if your child has this or you have this
start taking this combination at least 750 milligrams every single day plus
start reducing this right here omega-6 fatty acids
if you're not familiar how to do that i put a link down below
with another video i did so you can be aware of that you can start to cut
all those things out of your diet and once you do this come back to this video

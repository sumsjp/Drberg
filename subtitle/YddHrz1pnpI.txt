so this is a real question from someone that wanted to know what do i do if i
accidentally messed up on keto they went to a restaurant and they were served something that
was not supposed to have sugar in it but it did and they felt tired and irritable after this this
does happen especially when you're buying things and maybe you failed to read the ingredients and
then you find out later it had maltodextrin or a lot of sugar and you're wondering why it tasted
so good right and then what do you do very very simple in the brain you can use either sugar fuel
glucose or ketones and this is what you need to know the brain will always prefer
ketones over glucose which means all you have to do is either take liquid mct oil or
powdered mct oil or exogenous ketones you can get those as a supplement
and the liquid mct oil is a lot less expensive so you might want to try that but you could also use
you know other forms of ketones because all you're trying to do is elevate the amount of ketones in
your blood so the brain can suck them up and use them over sugar and you can start feeling better
immediately so this is just a little tip to tell you what to do if you accidentally
mess up hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here
avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system

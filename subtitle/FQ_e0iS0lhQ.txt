you know the medical profession doesn't recognize adrenal fatigue as an actual
condition which doesn't make sense because you
have an adrenal and the adrenal can become burnt out if you have too
much adrenal function like too much cortisol
that's called cushing's and if you have a deficiency of cortisol
and other adrenal hormones that's called addison's so why couldn't
someone develop a wear and tear or breakdown or fatigue of the adrenal
glands and the two big symptoms of adrenal
fatigue is number one chronic fatigue and chronic
inflammation okay because cortisol normally is an anti-inflammatory but if
the adrenals are weak and you run out of cortisol or it doesn't work
anymore because you have cortisol resistance
then you get inflammation out of all the actions
that you can do to restore and improve adrenal fatigue
the absolute most important thing is to get more sleep a hundred percent
of people with adrenal fatigue have poor sleep so they can never
recharge it's the sleep that helps to improve the
stress so it's not always just about the diet
in this case it's about recovering and restoring
sleep because once this occurs now the body can start to recharge you start to
heal you start to regenerate where you can actually handle a lot more
stress what is it that's preventing you from getting sleep
it could be pain or inflammation okay try to sleep
if your back is killing you or you have inflammation it's
going to be very difficult so for this you take vitamin d i would recommend
about 40000 ius of vitamin d3 and you're going
to find that the pain is going to go away
roughly could be within hours or a few days but
the more the adrenal glands are active and become fatigue the less vitamin d
you're going to have so you're most the time you're going to be
deficient vitamin d3 if you have adrenal fatigue
okay nightmares will keep you up having weird dreams thinking
analyzing things to death this is a b1 deficiency
nutritional yeast is what you need to take for that
and that will handle nightmares and help you sleep
then you have emf electromagnetic fields okay and i'm talking about
your computer your electrical devices your cell phone
but normally it'll be quite revealing to you if you actually had this tested
and found out of how extensive the electrical fields
and the magnetic fields extend from outlets next to your bed
from your computer from your backup battery to your computer
your printer your wi-fi devices i had to do a major cleanup and i was
amazed how that changed my physiology when i
did that i personally found that my energy went
way up i was able to last a lot longer uh through the day but emf is actually
becoming more and more of a problem simply because of the g5
situation which i really can't talk about that because i'll shut this video
down and just for the electrical devices that
we are around so this is a very important factor
this can affect your adrenals and prevent you from sleeping
i would get a testing device and start measuring around where you sleep
and you'll be quite shocked to find out that that could be
one of the reasons why you're not sleeping okay the next thing is your
heart if the heart is racing too much and you
have a high pulse rate because you're deficient in potassium or
magnesium that is going to keep you up if your
blood pressure is high that is going to keep you up if you have
blood pressure issues you need more potassium magnesium and vitamin d
now if you have arrhythmias that can prevent your body from getting into a
state of relaxation if you have the heart
flipping and flopping and making all these extra beats or skipping beats
throughout the night that's usually going to be a low
potassium magnesium problem which you need to work on
it could also be the emfs as well but there's three great
remedies that i would recommend if you have heart arrhythmia issues
berberine has been known to improve this quinine is another one
and you can get this as a nutritional supplement and forskolin
is another one right here the combination of these three i think could
greatly help you if you have abnormal heart rhythm
problems now you also have palpitations which
also can scare people because they think that that might be abnormal but
a great majority of people have palpitations and they're
pretty much normal unless you have over a certain percentage you can get a
24 hour or a 48 hour heart monitoring device to
determine if you have a problem or not but you'd be really surprised how many
people thought they had a problem when they
really don't because it's under a certain percentage
long walks vital vitally important as well as exercise for your sleep
i make sure i walk at least 45 minutes a day
now lowering your carbohydrates takes a huge stress
off the sympathetic nervous system the flight or fight
if you're stuck in stress mode flight or fight mode
by lowering your carb and doing fasting that can pull you right out of it just
from doing that right there so lowering your carbohydrates can help
support the parasympathetic nervous system
now this next one go to sleep when you're tired
a lot of people go to sleep by the clock and sometimes they might get tired at 8:30
9 o'clock or 9:30 but it might be too early for them so
they push through it and then all of a sudden they're awake
now they can't go to sleep they were tired an hour ago but now
they're not especially if you get past 12 o'clock
midnight it's really hard to go to sleep um it might take like a a period of an
hour to get to sleep because your body goes through these circadian waves so
you have to catch the wave so you can get it down to the delta wave
sleep so personally i go to sleep when i get tired and very frequently
it's like 9:30 i'll be in bed that seems to work take advantage of
when your body's tired and next thing is if you don't sleep
then take naps that's going to help your adrenal
fatigue and of course and most importantly if you have adrenal fatigue
we know that there's something stressing you out so isolate what that is
and do whatever you can do to improve that
and that's going to help as well thanks for watching

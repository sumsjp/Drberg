hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the best sources of calcium now the
thing you want to realize is you want to try to get your calcium from food not necessarily
supplements most people are taking calcium carbonate that's like stuck eating rocks it's
like limestone you'd be better off tuning on the cement on the side of the you know
building but here's some good food sources I'm not going to talk about milk or yogurt
because milk is usually pasteurized it's not a good product and yogurt has a lot of sugar but
kefir might be a good thing but cheese look at that one ounce of cheese has 240 milligrams of
calcium and this is bioavailable calcium - so I'm from Wisconsin adding a lot of cheese but
cheese is a really good source of calcium make sure it's grass-fed organic hormone-free sesame
seeds one tiny little teaspoon is 90 milligrams tahini that's that sesame seed butter you can get
this from any grocery store this is a really taste is very bland it's kind of like peanut
butter but I would mix it look at 1 tablespoon 263 milligrams of calcium Starr Dean's one can
is 370 milligrams and then we got kale is 94 per cup broccoli one cup is 178 pretty good look it's
double kale salmon 3 ounces is 180 so when you taking calcium realize that a lot of your food
has calcium so it's not hard to get calcium you don't eliminate as much calcium as other
things like magnesium so you'd probably want to get magnesium from the vegetables but usually
what happens is that when you consume calcium you need magnesium to work with it so in nature like
you're going to get calcium you're going to in these leafy greens you're going to get calcium
and magnesium together so they both work you know harmoniously ok so the other point I want to make
is if your stomach is too alkaline and that that means if you had like heartburn or acid reflux
or you're taking anti acids chances are you're not going to absorb calcium because using real
strong acid stomach to absorb calcium if you're deficient in vitamin D you will not be able to
transport or absorb calcium either also there's another vitamin called vitamin k2 I create a lot
of videos on that I'll put some videos down below but if you're deficient in vitamin k2 you will not
be able to mobilize calcium and starts to plug up the soft tissues in the joints and the arteries so
you get a whole bunch of issues with that but I wanted just to kind of give you some sources so
you might want to you know take note of that and thanks for watching I'll see you the next video

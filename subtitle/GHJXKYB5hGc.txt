so i suppose you've been pondering this for a very long time do your nuts have to be organic or can
you consume conventional nuts let's talk about it the nut that has the most pesticides of any nut
is actually the walnut however peanuts actually have more pesticide residues but technically
it's legume it's a it's a bean okay so the walnut is actually just super saturated with chemicals
you have cashews pistachios walnuts macadamia nuts they all have a lot of chemicals on them
but here's the big question can the pesticide penetrate the hard shell no it can't okay but
they are sprayed with pesticides after they're picked and cracked open unfortunately
yes and so those pesticides they're all fat soluble and there's a lot of oils in the
in the fat so they go in like a rocket ship so you're dealing with a nut that has a good
amount of chemicals on it so um the answer is if possible you need to go with the organic okay
uh i think it's very important however they're very very expensive
so at least at the very bare minimum do fair trade nuts they have less amount of chemical sprays
or you could actually buy them in shells and de-shell them yourself a little less expensive
a little more work oh and as a side note brazil nuts the unique thing about brazil
nuts is that they're only collected in the wild from the amazon rainforest now it is true that
there's no pesticides in the rainforest but unless they're organic they could also be sprayed as well
after they crack them open so by buying more brazil nuts you can actually contribute to
saving the rainforest a little bit more so ideally it's best to go organic
if you can't always do that make sure you don't consume large amounts also if you're consuming
like cruciferous vegetables on a regular basis the phytonutrients in those vegetables do help reduce
the toxic effect from environmental toxicities as far as peanuts go i consume the organic valencia
peanuts you're going to get less pesticides and you're going to also get less toxins from
certain funguses that can grow around peanuts so i'm going to do a separate video on that all

Hey, guys, Dr. Berg here in this video I want to introduce you to a new product I
just came out with called electrolyte powder. Okay so what's unique about this
is that it doesn't have any sugar it doesn't have any maltodextrin
it has a thousand milligrams of potassium citrate that is very very safe
on your body and you hypothetically could use this to enhance your potassium
if you're not consuming enough vegetables you could even do three or
even four servings to reach your maximum dosage of about 47 to 5,000 milligrams
but here it has the calcium potassium magnesium chloride and sodium and trace
minerals 71 ionic trace minerals all in one blend and it has a touch of stevia
with some natural flavorings of raspberry and lemon so it tastes good
putting water dissolve it up drink it up and it's used mainly to enhance your
exercise performance most electrolyte powders have sugar and it lowers your
performance this is also great to support a healthy cardiovascular
system and improve your energy so there's four main things the
electrolytes do number one they help your fluids they help hydrate you they
prevent from dehydration they help fluid move it in and out of
the cell okay so they're great it's great for like edema or swelling things
like that it's also supports the nervous system so the nerves need electrolytes
for the rhythm that prevent palpitations prevent tetany that's that little
twitching on the eye or a little or throughout the body improve and help
balance the heart rate okay it's mainly potassium helped influence the pH so
your pH is just correct so the electrolytes and pH work together
if your electrolytes are off that can throw off your ph if your pH is off that
can throw off your electrolytes and also primarily it affects muscle physiology
the contraction and relaxation of the muscle and then of course if you don't
have that you get cramps weakness or spasm okay so I put a link down below to
get more information check it out and I think I think you'd find this quite
helpful!

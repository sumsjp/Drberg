hey guys today we're gonna talk about the difference between Powerade vs.
Gatorade you go to the grocery store and you will see an entire huge aisle filled
with both of these items right here so their marketing is very very good I
don't know if you knew this but Powerade is owned by coca-cola Gatorade is owned
by Pepsi Cola and by the way coca-cola now owns Powerade Minute Maid honesty
another one called Odwalla juice I don't know how to pronounce that exactly
simple orange sprite vitamin water which by the way they bought for 4.1 billion
dollars which contains 31 grams of sugar 6 teaspoons and also Zico coconut water
alright so what are the mains differences okay from a 12 ounce bottle
well they both contain 21 grams of sugar okay
let's evaluate what type of sugar sucrose versus high fructose corn syrup
now you're probably thinking that high fructose corn syrup is worse but the
fact that they don't tell you where the sucrose comes from they don't say sugar
cane it could come from and it probably is coming from the beet sugar which is
GMO okay that means it has residue of glyphosate not to mention I've heard of
corn syrup comes from corn and that definitely has residues of glyphosate as
well now sucrose is 50% glucose in 50% fructose high fructose corn syrup is
roughly 42% fructose and 58% glucose so sucrose actually has more fructose and
fructose creates more insulin resistance than glucose because it overloads the
liver and the liver actually puts it right in the storage and because of the
high amounts of this sugar the body will start developing insulin or
so both of these are very similar but probably sucrose is a little bit worse
okay then it has dextrose which is a synthetic sugar and modified food starch
and this is another name for monosodium glutamate so this is a flavor enhancer
it makes it taste better than it really is
alright then we have the electrolytes okay we have potassium and sodium we
only have two we don't have all of them and they give you about 35 milligrams
potassium and just so you know our bodies need 4700 milligrams every single
day so this is a very very small small fraction of what you really need so on
Powerade we have thirty five and Gatorade has forty five sodium we have a
hundred and fifty milligrams and over here we have a hundred sixty milligrams
of sodium and Powerade has some synthetic b6 b3 b12 and Gatorade does
not have the added vitamins so which one's better which one's worse actually
they're both worse why because of the amount of sugar
it's sugar water with a couple little minerals with a lot of sodium so if
you're trying to hydrate yourself get something with all the electrolytes
without the sugar without the hidden sugar without the malted dextran and
you're gonna be much better off now sometimes you'll hear that hey when
you're exercising you need to replace the sugar that you're burning off as
you're tapping into your glycogen reserve but the problem is if you're
going to replace your glycogen reserve you're going to completely stop your
ability to tap into your fat reserve which probably is one of the main
reasons why you're exercising in the first place right so both of these are
not gonna help you lose weight and chances are you're gonna probably have
less endurance and you may even get tired because the amount of sugar you
spike the sugar insulin comes in pushes the sugar down you end up with low blood
sugar about an hour later and if you want some more data on electrolytes I
put a link down below check it out and thank you so much for watching
so if you like this video go ahead and share it with someone that you know that
can truly benefit from it

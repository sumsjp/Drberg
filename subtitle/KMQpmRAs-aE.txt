hey guys today I want to talk about an interesting relationship between candida
and MCT oil okay for medium chain triglycerides and that would be a type
of fat in coconut oil so there's several things in coconut oil that are
antifungal antimicrobial and that would be one would be lauric acid another one
would be MCT oil itself MCT oil has the capacity to reduce Candida in the body
now Candida normally lives in our body and it doesn't bother us
we live with it it doesn't create much harm but when it has an overgrowth as in
Candida albicans that's when you have a problem now what is Candida Candida is a
cousin to mold and it's related to fungus so it's in that family so when
you get an overgrowth of Candida your tongue becomes white you get a burning
sensation in your mouth like an acidic taste cottonmouth which is very dry dry
cracked skin and the corners of your mouth also you can actually have like a
bad taste in your mouth then you can get fatigue one of the reasons why you're
tired is that this microorganism competes for nutrients so it'll actually
start consuming your nutrients and leave you deficient in b6 essential fatty
acids low magnesium low iron and vitamin A so having this overgrowth of Candida
can create nutritional deficiencies now this normally comes after taking an
antibiotic or doing something that destroys your gut flora also Candida
releases certain types of toxic materials that can lead to even
something called auto-brewery syndrome now this is rare but it's where your
body starts fermenting carbohydrates and turning that into alcohol sometimes when
you're talking to someone that has an overgrowth of Candida there's a certain
smell of a fermentation or even an alcohol smell and that's what's
happening right here one really really important thing you need to know so if
you've checked out on this video check back in because this is very very
important candida and mold and fungus and yeast all live on carbohydrates if
you just stop consuming sugar and refined carbs and lower your carbs as an
Aikido diet you're going to starve off the candida okay it's that simple
there's several other things I'm gonna recommend to dealing with this candy
that one is MCT oil one teaspoon or one tablespoon a day you work up to it it's
going to be enough over a week or two to actually wipe out Candida as long as
you're cutting out the sugar because MCT or like I said is antifungal it's
antimicrobial the other thing that's very very important is to do fasting
fasting kind of resets your gut it stops feeding the pathogens and believe it or
not your own good bacteria and a friendly fungus start to become stronger
and more diverse now you think that starving your microbes would make it
worse but no it's just the opposite they actually they live longer they do much
better so fasting will also stimulate a condition called autophagy and that's a
condition where your body is starting to eat up
microbes and recycle them so as a therapy fasting would be great for
Candida versus consuming like six small meals a day or three meals and two
snacks not good the other thing that can help the byproduct or the detoxification
would be to take the trace mineral molybdenum this particular trace mineral
helps reduce the side effects of Candida if you want more information about

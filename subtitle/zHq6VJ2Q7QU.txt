all right the number one sign that your child is consuming
too much sugar can you guess
something related to their mood their grouchy
angry irritable whining defiant or pouty that might not be real to
you your child is probably very very calm
but if they start experiencing a lot of mood issues
it could be the sugar now when i was in practice for 29 years
i always had people that came to me with this problem over and over and i
just assumed that everyone knows about this and so they
would bring the child to the psychiatrist to get a
diagnosis completely unnecessary it's not a mental
problem it's a physical problem it's a blood
sugar problem and of course upon asking a couple
questions i would find out that they're giving their child orange juice grape
juice cherry juice apple juice thinking that
that's healthy for them it's pure sugar they would do applesauce
which basically has more sugar than even candy and it's all pasteurized
and cooked and a lot of times even add sugar in
there so it's really a refined product and then of course you
have all the fruit snacks the fruit juice
granola bars which has massive amounts of sugar
vitamin water energy drinks sport drinks filled with sugar not to mention mac and
cheese and all the other cookies and candies that kids eat
this would be the first symptom though that that child would experience because
what happens is the blood sugars go up insulin kicks in pushes it down now they
end up with low blood sugar so these are all low blood sugar symptoms
sugar in general interferes with different parts of the brain
in the production of certain neurotransmitters serotonin dopamine
other things as well that calm the nervous system
also it blocks the absorption of vitamin c
the chemistry of sugar and vitamin c is very similar
so in the presence of sugar you can't absorb vitamin c and vitamin c is
necessary to make neurotransmitters as well also
with the sugar you're going to deplete zinc vitamin b1 potassium
and magnesium all key minerals and vitamins
that calm your child down in this state the child is going to be hyperactive
they're going to have attention deficit problems
they're going to have a real difficult time learning
and studying and retaining information because they're just
their body is completely on edge if your child has any mood issues at all
always check the blood sugars first i would get them on
a special healthy eating plants called healthy keto
and i put a link down below for those of you that are not familiar with this
and you're going to notice a huge change in the
calmness of the child their ability to focus
and have self-control

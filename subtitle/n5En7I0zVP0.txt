hey i'm back and you know I've talked a lot about herbs recently now I want to talk
about a slightly different effect that certain herbs and spices have anti
glycation now what does anti glycation mean glycation is a word used to
describe a situation where you have glucose combining with a protein or
glucose combining with a fat in a certain way that makes that protein
unavailable if you think about it you have all these different proteins in the
body that are doing millions of different functions and if you have this
glucose molecule that locks in there and morphs with it and makes that protein
unavailable and then that dysfunctional protein or the dysfunctional fat creates
all sorts of problems in the body so we call that term advanced glycation
end-products and there's several concepts out that they talk about aging
being the accumulation of the advanced glycation end-products so that's the
simplicity of glycation you're morphing this sugar with a protein or fat and
you're creating irreversible damage and also massive free radical damage that
then ends up in the cascade of effects that can occur there are several potent
spices and herbs that are very strong inhibitors of advanced glycation
end-products and these are the most potent so we have anise we have cinnamon
so you can sprinkle this on your cinnamon toast I'm being very sarcastic
allspice which is actually one words not two words and another name for allspice
is Jamaican pepper okay it's a very specific type of spice very potent to
give off anti glycation properties a clove is very very high and so is
oregano but what I want you to realize is that if your diet is not right these
herbs are not going to do anything they're not going to work so you want to
obviously do a low glucose diet that's why a low carb diet also as a strong
inhibitor of a AGEs exercise is another potent inhibitor of AGEs and then of
course another very powerful inhibitor would be fasting
okay so the combination of all these would be very very good but if you're
cooking with different foods and things try to include some of these herbs and
spices just to give you a little additional help to reduce the effects of
advanced glycation end-products thanks for watching
so I just spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how
to bulletproof your immune system and there's 21 different lessons and I want
to give you this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is
sometimes people don't value it as much but I want to get it out there so I'm
just gonna give it to you free and I want to let you know that it's extremely
extremely valuable right now we're in a situation of uncertainty they're talking
about a second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that
maybe say who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room no
one is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm gonna
teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you can do to
strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements number one I want
you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands of people had this
information to protect themselves but not only that getting rid of the fear
factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean when you think about it
it's very similar to someone being bullied in school as soon as they learn
self-defense they're gonna be less adversely affected by these bullies so
why not give you the information on your immune system so you know what to do to
protect yourself you see a lot of people that are scared I see them on exercise
like in in the park they're wearing a mask while they're exercising or walking
by themselves or in a car they're wearing a mask and a shield so please
share this course with everyone you know if you want to help someone this is the
best way to help them to give them the nah
of how to strengthen your immune system we want this to go viral in a healthy
way alright number two be active on your course and actually complete the course
okay take your time really learn the
information there's questions that you're gonna have to answer but stick
with it and number three send me your success when you complete the course and
sometimes when I talk to people they end the conversation with be safe and I
thought to myself what does that mean be safe
well wear the mask and also avoid getting too close to people right well
that's cool but what about strengthening the immune
system that way you could be not just safe but you could be very very smart
because the missing link is a strong immune system that gives you the
ultimate protection I really believe that the best thing that we can do both
you and I to help people is to spread this out and get everyone to know this
information and here's what I came up with for the top three people that share
this course with the most people I'm gonna give them a one-hour one-on-one
video consult with dr. Berg myself and we can talk about anything or your
health or whatever and then for the top 100 people that share this course I'm
gonna give this group video access to a very special webinar that's going to be
live on a topic that I can't necessarily do in a YouTube video because it'll be
taken down but just realize it's going to be some very powerful information
that you're gonna learn that's going to really help you and people around you
sorry to give you that mystery but unfortunately social media is filtering
out certain topics right now and the top 100 will also get access to my virtual
keto summit at the end of August last point do you get access to this
information you have to have messenger now some of you don't use messenger and
unfortunately everything is set up a messenger so I would recommend signing
up a messenger and if you don't want to continue use it after the course just
opt-out I think you're really going to enjoy
course I put a lot of time into it the information is down below and spread the
word

today we're gonna talk about how to enhance your autophagy with coffee in
herbs now what is a autophagy it means self-eat and it's basically a state or
condition where your body gets into where it's recycling damaged proteins
and pathogens you have all the cellular machinery inside your cells you have
mitochondria which is the energy factory you have the DNA the blueprints
when these proteins become damaged they can create more damage in your body so
your body has developed a system to recycle them break them down with
certain enzymes and then create new proteins it's quite fascinating but will
also help you eliminate pathogens because they're not needed that's really
cool so that's what a autophagy is it's a repair mechanism it reduces
inflammation extend your life it's anti-cancer and anti-aging other than
that it's not that great I'm being very sarcastic it's actually awesome most
people think about inducing a autophagy when they're doing fasting my opinion is
that autophagy kicks in around 16 to 18 hours and fasting but I don't know that
for a fact that's just my opinion there's really no studies to to tell you
exactly the time that you're gonna induce a autophagy but this is my guess
exercise will also increase autophagy and believe it or not coffee can also
help you to some degree now of course I always recommend one cup not like a lot
of coffee simply because all that caffeine is going to affect your sleep
and if you're not sleeping that's gonna knock you out of autophagy so just a
small amount of coffee of course you know if you want to put some sweetener
in it use erythritol or xylitol maybe a little tiny cream but if you have a
choice between half and half in full cream I would do the cream because it
has lower amounts of carbohydrates and if you're just using a little bit of
cream it's not gonna be that big of a deal
limiting the benefits of autophagy sulforaphane this is a phytonutrient or
phytochemical and cruciferous vegetables especially
broccoli or broccoli sprouts so you could take these as a supplement and
enhance your autophagy now what about consuming sprouts themselves or a little
bit of broccoli well the interesting thing about autophagy is that not only
will a fasting induce of autophagy but a very low calorie diet will also help
autophagy and if we look at all the foods out there the foods that have the lowest
calorie and that have the highest nutrients would be the vegetables I'm
mainly talking about the cruciferous vegetables is because they have so many
different types of phytonutrients vitamins minerals they have certain
amino acids they even have a precursor to omega-3 fatty acids which is ALA
having a little bit of broccoli sprouts could enhance your autophagy and then we
have the phytonutrient in green tea EGCG which will not only induce autophagy but
it's anti-inflammatory it has very powerful antioxidants and it's very
anti-cancer then we have curcumin from the spice turmeric that can help
increase autophagy as well as the final nutrient resveratrol which is in several
things one is the grape skin it's also very high in something called knotweed
very good for to extend your life it can induce autophagy anti-inflammatory
antioxidant and of course because it's in grapes it would just make sense that
you should just start drinking bottles of wine before you go to bed and I'm
being very sarcastic again because the alcohol will affect the liver and
prevent the benefits but as a plan-b just take the grapes themselves and
squash out the inside where all the sugar is and eat the skin of the grapes
and you'll be good to go or just take it as a pill to make it easy so anyway I
just wanted to create this video to show you that not only fasting will induce
autophagy but other things will do it as well thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no sugar

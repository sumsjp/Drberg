there's five reasons why you may not be losing weight
when you're fasting now i want to clarify what this video is about
i'm not talking about intermittent fasting i'm talking about
just fasting for a longer period of time but since we're on the topic of
intermittent fasting if you're doing intermittent fasting and
keto and you're not losing weight usually it's because you're doing too
many carbs okay i've done a lot of videos on this
you just have to really lower your carbs sometimes down to 10 grams
per day or less it could also be that you're just not fasting long enough
you your metabolism is slow and you're fasting let's say 16 hours or 18 hours
you may need to do longer or you're just consuming too much fat
and your body's turning the dietary fat into ketones not your
own fat into ketones so these are the three
things to pay attention to but what this video is about
is let's say you're fasting for a longer period of time
two days three days and you're not losing weight
why how can that be well there's a couple reasons for this
being in practice for 29 years i've ran into certain individuals
that fasted for quite a period of time with hardly any weight loss and i'm just
going to tell you what we found with those people
they usually always had an extremely slow
metabolism so let's say at birth you just were overweight
sometimes kids have an infection and then they are given steroids or
medication or antibiotics that then mess up their
metabolism early on and then their parents might put them on
diets after diet after diet that slows down
the metabolism that could be one reason so number one
number two constipation if you're constipated you
could be walking around with five to seven
extra pounds of waste in your body and that could uh
act as a barrier for you to lose weight number three stress
stress activates the hormone cortisol cortisol
breaks down your own muscle protein turns in the sugar
and that sugar will raise insulin and that will keep you from losing weight so
this is a biggie right here and this also includes having an
infection so if you're fasting and you have this
severe infection you may not lose weight why because of the high levels of
cortisol even though if you have an infection
fasting is a necessary thing because that will help your immune system
number four not sleeping this will also increase cortisol
add more stress and it will mess up your blood sugars
so this will definitely keep you from losing weight
also water retention for various reasons so that could be another reason why
you're not losing weight there's a couple things that i'm going
to recommend you want to always be taking nutrients
electrolytes b vitamins trace minerals vitamin d all very important
why you need to improve insulin resistance
you have to take nutrients that help insulin resistance which is behind this
thing right here that's going to speed things up this one
right here real example i worked with this lady who
did fasting for almost three days and barely lost anything now she had
constipation and what was happening was the liver was
just all jammed up and things were not
flowing that well when you take purified bile salts on an
empty stomach of course you're fasting so it's going
to be an empty stomach you can just take three times a day
it tends to open up the ducts the bile ducts
the pancreatic ducts the ducts through the liver and allows drainage
not to mention bile itself helps burn fat that's what we recommended to this
person and then things started to become
relieved with this finally they started losing weight i'm
just pointing this out because it was quite amazing
going from no weight loss to a really good weight loss
next thing is do things to increase sleep i'll put a link down below of
what i'm going to recommend to help sleep but also
decrease stress so we want to increase sleep decrease stress
if you're stressed out you're not sleeping it's going to severely affect
your ability to lose weight while you're
fasting and lastly you just have to give it more time especially if you have a
slow metabolism all right go ahead and try
those things and comment down below before you go if

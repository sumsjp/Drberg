today i'm going to talk about bad food and drug combinations now let me just clarify i'm not
talking about bad foods and drug combinations of talking about bad food and drug combinations
okay number one tylenol plus alcohol equals liver toxicity very bad combination sometimes tylenol
comes in 1000 milligram tablets which is quite high and if you have over four of those per day
you develop liver toxicity in a major way and so if you drink alcohol you don't want to consume
tylenol within 12 hours okay just bad combination and by the way in one of my videos i talked about
a very powerful herb that protects the liver against poisons and that would be milk thistle so
if you take tylenol or drink alcohol milk thistle would be something that i would highly recommend
on a regular basis all right number two sedatives while you're drinking alcohol
not a good combination and i'm talking about valium xanax klonopin sedatives depress the
central nervous system so there's alcohol so potentially it can really drop your blood pressure
your respiration your heart rate it can actually do a lot more than that so you want to avoid those
two combinations number three certain calcium channel blockers and grapefruit now i did a
video on grapefruit i'll put a link down below if you haven't seen it but has a certain chemical
that blocks the breakdown of drugs through the liver so you don't get this breakdown of poisons
or drugs and so it can build up and accumulate and so even one grapefruit or seven ounces of
grapefruit juice is enough to create some major toxicity now statins are another common drug that
you don't want to combine with grapefruit in fact there's quite a few and i talked more about that
in the video that i did on grapefruit i'll put a link down below number four bronchodilators and
caffeine not a good mix now one chemical in bronchodilators theophylline resembles caffeine
and something else called theobromine which is a stimulant in chocolate and so when you're taking
a bronchodilator and caffeine at the same time or something with theobromine you get this massive
stimulation and it could mess up the heart the heart rhythm it can even trigger seizures all
right last one is beta-blockers don't do well with high protein foods it greatly increases
the bioavailability by 53% and so when you're told to take this certain amount you're actually taking
twice the amount which could create side effects but ideally the thing to do is to get so healthy
that the need for drugs is not even there hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

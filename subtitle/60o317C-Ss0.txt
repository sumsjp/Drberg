so let's discuss how to lose weight if you're post menopausal i've done a lot of videos on this topic
i would definitely not neglect the standard things because these normally work about 90 of the time
bring your carbs down really low you're probably going to bring them down
to 10 grams or even less per day not per meal fast longer
at the bare minimum you should be doing one meal a day but with periodic prolonged fasting these two
most the time will work now to speed things up start adding exercise as far as how often
i would recommend only once a week but make sure that exercise is intense and you're sweating okay
and you're working the whole body and then let your body recover do that for a while
then add two workouts a week on the off days i highly recommend you go for long walks to keep
the stress down so you can then sleep adding another half hour or even an hour of sleep will
help you lose weight big time and number five your favorite recommendation which is avoiding
alcohol but the problem is that little bit of wine which is carbs has a potential to really keep you
out of fat burning so you might want to just take it put it to the side maybe do kombucha tea for
a while as a transition so let's say for example you do all these things right here and you still
can't lose weight what do you do your pituitary produces many different hormones one hormone
is called follicle stimulating hormone and the purpose is to tell the ovaries
to make estrogen but you're post-menopausal so these ovaries have gone into retirement so
that's not going to happen so what happens after menopause is this hormone stays on the high side
why because we're not getting any feedback from this ovary so this hormone is on a feedback loop
it turns off when you get the ovary to respond but it's actually ignoring the pituitary
so this just stays high now the other function of fsh is that it can make fat so there's receptors
for this hormone in your fat cells and that is a big problem simply because after menopause
there's a big spike in this hormone that stays high despite the backup supply of estrogen and
other hormones from your adrenals and your fat because the more fat you have the more
estrogen you're gonna make and estrogen by itself contributes to the amount of fat that you have on
your body after menopause cortisol does go up as well and that stress hormone can turn your muscle
protein into fat increase your insulin and in the presence of insulin you're not going to lose any
weight so it's very very important to keep your stress level as low as possible and you can do
that through lots of sleep but the fact that your follicle stimulating hormone is too high could be
another hidden reason why you're just not able to lose weight so there's a couple things you can do
one is take what's called myonosatol this is a type of b vitamin now it's not technically
currently a b vitamin but it was considered a b vitamin at one time but myo-inositol taken in
a good amount can help regulate this hormone as well as luteinizing hormone from the pituitary so
this is a really good thing to take postmenopausal also royal jelly is another natural product that
you can take as well that can help lower this hormone as well bees make royal jelly
and this compound is for the queen bee to help the fertility of the queen bee and it just so happens
that they can accumulate it they make a supplement out of it and you can take it to help balance out
your um pituitary hormones so it tends to help normalize if a hormone is is too high
or too low in pituitary as it relates to stimulating the ovaries so at first
definitely implement these things right here if you're not happy with the results then add
these two supplements right here all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

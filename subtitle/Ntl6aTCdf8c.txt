so today we're going to talk about black tea okay so black tea has some pretty serious health
benefits it helps you with your blood sugars it can decrease cholesterol not that cholesterol is
bad for you but it can help you regulate your cholesterol antiviral properties antibacterial
properties it can help decrease your cavities and it can also help decrease the risk of osteoporosis
and there's a lot of research that can help decrease the risk of the metabolic syndrome which
involves the blood pressure the cholesterol the belly fat etc from high insulin so black tea
can help lower insulin it can help decrease blood sugar decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease
as well as decrease the risk from stroke now of course it's obvious that none of these benefits
are going to curve if someone's eating very poorly but if you're eating healthily and you add this
to your normal diet i think it can actually give you some additional benefits but i think the
biggest benefit of black tea is its anti-cancer properties now black tea is a fermented green tea
but it's not really fermented it's oxidized giving you a new compound called theaflavin so theaflavin
is higher in black tea than it is in green tea and that phytonutrient is really the red pigment in
black tea now what's so unique about this pigment or this phytonutrient fas stands for fatty acid
synthase now what well what does that mean well it's an enzyme that helps you make lipids in your
body and cancer cells need a lipid membrane to exist and it just so happens that this enzyme that
makes this fatty acid is overexpressed in cancer in other words cancer cells require more of this
so if you can inhibit this enzyme you can inhibit cancer and the studies that i'm going to link down
below which you can check out demonstrate that the power of egcg in green tea can inhibit fas
by 76 percent but the phytonutrient in black tea theaflavin can decrease fas by
87 so in other words both green tea and black tea have potent anti-cancer properties but black tea
is a more potent inhibitor of this fatty acid enzyme all right thanks for watching

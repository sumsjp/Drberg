now it's very interesting that there's a lot of corruption in the olive oil
business it's been going on for a very very long time so you want to make sure
when you buy olive oil you're getting the right stuff now
i've been consuming probably a counterfeit olive oil
for years because it wasn't until recently that i went to
italy and actually tasted real olive oil that
i knew the difference between the counterfeit
and real olive oil and oh my goodness when you have authentic
real olive oil it is so delicious
it's a very green bright peppery grassy fresh taste and all these years i had no
idea that olive oil was supposed to taste
like this i was consuming the flavorless and rancid olive oil
which actually had barely any flavor and i thought that's
what olive oil should taste like well that was because a lot of companies
were blending the olive oil with a cheaper low quality oil and only until
recently is the fda going after some of these
counterfeits so here are some general rules i'm going
to talk about first thing is i would not go after the large brands that you would
buy in the grocery store simply because you don't really know if
it's legitimate and ideally if you can go to a specialty
store that you can sample the olive oil that
would be the best now there's a couple things
that you want to look at you would want to always get the extra
virgin olive oil not just the virgin oil um not the
light or the pure but this doesn't necessarily always
guarantee that it's the real deal but it's going
to help you narrow it down number two it'd be good
to find the harvest date not best by this date or
bottled on this date because what these companies
do is they take olive oil and they ship it around the world
and they bottle it somewhere else after they combine
other oils so we're not interested in this date we want the harvest date
or processed on this specific date would be good to have a third party seal
and number four like i just talked about buying your olive oil from a specialty
store is probably going to be the best thing
or you can actually order it right from italy or some other
country that would you know has the real deal that's what
we did here's a brand right here that is
seriously fresh okay i mean the taste is incredible
uh unfortunately i go through this pretty fast
but you can see that it has pretty much all the things that i talked about right
here and it's empty i need to order more and
ideally you want the name of the producer
or the estate where that olive oil was originated from now i did put some links
down below of some good authentic brands that are
legitimate you can check it out and thanks for

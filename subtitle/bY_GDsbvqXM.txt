i wanted to touch on a very important hormone called dhea as it relates to menopause there
are definitely a lot of therapeutic benefits for men but i'm going to mainly focus on the
benefits of using dhea for women now what is dhea it's a steroid hormone precursor in other
words in your body you have a lot of different hormones and hormones can be made from proteins
or cholesterol and so cholesterol is like a building block for steroid hormones so you
have cholesterol which is a precursor for dhea and dhea is a precursor for estrogen
androgens and a lot of the other steroid hormones now the other interesting thing about
dhea is that it is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in the human body and
because it's a precursor for so many other hormones when you get older dhea diminishes
greatly it can drop to levels of 70 to 80 percent of what you had when you're younger now what does
it mean if you're a female going through menopause well the older you get the less estrogen you're
going to have the less androgen you're going to have and dhea is sold as a supplement you can
get it over the counter it's very easy to get it's also sold as a medication and as a side note you
can increase your dhea by exercising by fasting and calorie restriction having enough dhea also
helps protect against insulin resistance so without dhea you can actually have higher amounts
of insulin in the body and it can affect your weight your metabolism and many other things now
i'm going to get into what dhea is used for but i want to make a special point you want to start
out with very low amounts okay like between 10 milligrams and 30 milligrams per day why because
if you take too much you can end up making too many androgens and if you're female you don't want
too many androgens you want just the right amount so you may find that you're getting acne oily
skin hair growth through your body that you don't want now if you're a man and you're watching this
you usually can take a little bit more between 50 to 100 milligrams simply because
your body has a lot more androgens than women okay so what is it used for it's used in adrenal
insufficiency so if you have adrenal problems like you don't have enough adrenal function uh there's
a condition called addison's where your adrenals aren't even working this would be very beneficial
and that is because dhea is made by your adrenals as well as the gonads ovaries and testicles all
right it's also used in menopausal hormone therapy the third use is in treating painful
sexual intercourse due to vaginal atrophy and the last benefit for females is it does
increase your libido so if you want to try this make sure you start off with very small amounts
and then gradually increase until you achieve your goal now one little point before you take
dhea you don't want to take dhea if you already have too much estrogen or too much androgen so
if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome where you have too much androgen you don't want to
take this because you're going to end up with acne oily skin and more body hair all right thanks for

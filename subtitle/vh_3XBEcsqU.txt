so in the last 29 years of practice working on
40 000 people as a chiropractor there's been a lot of people that came
into my office with neck pain that had no
injuries no reason for the neck pain if this is you you have neck pain and you
have no injury keep watching because i'm going to show
you what's really behind it the problem is not in your neck
you have something called referred pain the pain in your neck
is coming from something down in your digestive system because there's
something that you ate that's causing a problem
either in your gallbladder or the ducts that go to the gallbladder
or the ducts that extend over to the pancreas
the gallbladder is on the right side the pancreas is on the left side
and you have ducts that go both ways if there is a blockage
or some type of sludge or irritation in these little ducts it will put
pressure on the diaphragm which is connected to
two nerves it's called the phrenic nerves you have one on the right
one on the left the phrenic nerve goes from your diaphragm all the way up to
this side of your neck the left side goes all the way over to the left side
of your neck so when you step on a dog's tail he
barks through his mouth right same thing with this you put
pressure on this nerve it refers pain in tightness to the right
side or the left side this is so common and hardly anyone
knows about this and it's such an easy thing to fix
it's just a simple change in your diet chances are you just consume too many
omega-6 fatty acids so that would be something
that was fried in some oil for example or could be some
something you ate like mayonnaise that had a lot of soy oil or
corn oil or something cooked in oil it could be corn chips
it could be anything related to corn cotton seed
canola or soy so those are the omega-6 fatty acids if you
have too many of these it just creates inflammation in your gut area
excessive amount of nuts or peanut butter or nut butters
why because nuts are also high in omega-6 fatty acids
omega-6 fatty acids are inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids are
anti-inflammatory like fish oils for example
so too many nuts will definitely irritate it as well
it could also be refined grains okay refined grains and sugars will
definitely just tear up the gallbladder and the
digestive area especially in the pancreas too
packaged food which is void of enzymes that
basically your body has to make all the new enzymes from the pancreas and it has
to work really hard and so too many cooked foods without
enzymes will create a an irritation in the
pancreas and it can cause referred pain to your neck
so you have the liver on the right side here and then you have these little
ducts that come right here and you have little ducts that go into the pancreas
back and forth the pancreas is releasing certain things
going this way and then the liver releases things down
here they dump into the small intestine bile is released as well and what's
happening is we're getting dilation or swelling in these little
tubes right here and that is referring to pain
on your neck so you could also take purified bile salts
kind of empty stomach a few times a day to help open this up but ultimately
you're going to have to change your diet if you're new to my channel and you

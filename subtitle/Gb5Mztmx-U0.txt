hey dr berg here again i want to point
out
a very important factor relating to
what diet a person should be on so you
started out doing the liver enhancement
right
yes yeah you did that for how long i did
it for two weeks 14 years
14 days yes and then it actually did
work for you initially right
yes i lost 6 pounds okay then what
happened and then
um i went to do the regular
salad 10 cups of salad and really strict
on that but i have a thyroid and i
didn't lose any weight after that so i
kept coming
i did the regular routine
and nothing changed so here's an example
of
this is why we have several diets in the
book
if someone is not doing good on certain
diet they're on the wrong diet
so we actually put her not on the
thyroid diet we put her in
on chapter 13 which is the adrenal diet
and what happened was as soon as you
went on that diet what happened
well as soon as i went on that diet i
noticed that i slept better
i started losing weight more interest
than than weight but i could feel it in
my clothes
right away wow and then didn't you say
you uh you were sick right
yeah i was sick um a weekend ago a
couple of days ago
and then i got better in two days and
that has never happened before
so here's the point of if you do the
diet
and you're not successful you are in the
wrong diet the diet has to produce
change so don't think that you have to
stay on one diet for the rest of your
life
each body is different we have different
glands we require different nutrients
your body requires more protein so
that's just a good point that i want to
bring up so
if by chance things aren't smooth
you're on the wrong program so
reevaluate go on the right chapter
and get success

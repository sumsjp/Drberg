so you always want to eat cooked mushrooms okay here's why because mushrooms in their structure
okay they're different than plants and their membranes and the mushroom is a fungus have
chitins in their membranes okay now chitins are also the material in the exoskeletons
of arthropods like crabs lobsters shrimp and insects and that substance is completely
indigestible you can't digest it and so when you're eating these mushrooms that are raw
you might have a stomachache also mushrooms have the precursor to making vitamin d chew so and this
is just a side note you can actually take these raw mushrooms and leave them out in the sun for a
day and you will then build up more raw material to be making vitamin d2 which will then be
converted to d3 a little side note but the main point of this video is just to cook your mushrooms
steam them so now you can actually digest this material a lot better and you don't end up
with a stomachache hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

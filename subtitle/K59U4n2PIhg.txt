so this video is mainly for diabetics as you may know dietary sugar will raise your
blood sugar right but there's something else that can raise your blood sugar in fact it's
pretty significant and i haven't really came across a lot information on this this one
point so i wanted to do a video on it but it's called gluconeogenesis now what does that mean
well it's a big word that basically means your body is generating new glucose from non-sugar
or glucose sources non-carbohydrate sources okay so your body can make new sugar from fat or
protein okay so your high blood sugar is not just about your dietary sugar it's about your body is
actually making sugar from other things in fact the amount of sugar in your blood is significantly
coming from gluconeogenesis and this is because diabetics have an enhanced gluconeogenesis so your
liver and your kidneys are just making tons of sugar raising your blood sugar it's very important
to know that our bodies don't need much sugar okay there's only a very few parts of our body that
is dependent on sugar everything else can live on other sources of fuel like fatty acid
and ketones okay but the red blood cell part of your kidney number three
t cells part of the immune system and sertoli cells in your testicles which basically are those
cells that help make sperm require glucose but everything else in the body
can use other types of fuel so we don't need much and this also means that our body has the ability
to make the sugar the bottom line is we don't need sugar or carbohydrate from our diet in any way
other than maybe some dietary fiber which is considered a carbohydrate but our bodies can't
even digest that our microbes digest that and turn that into various things so the question
is if you're diabetic why is your body doing this why is it making so much sugar well that
is because insulin is not working in your body even though there might be high levels of insulin
in the blood which is rarely ever tested you have insulin resistance so it's dysfunctional so really
insulin is not doing its job because insulin normally inhibits gluconeogenesis okay
it actually keeps it in check the real problem is insulin resistance that is what's causing
the high level of sugar in your blood so what is the solution the solution is to focus on
fixing insulin resistance if you can do that your body will make less sugar
and your blood sugars will start improving now if you're new to my channel there's something called
the ketogenic diet in intermittent fasting that you need to know about and i put a link down below
and there's a free download you can check it out and start to get on the program because
that program will greatly improve insulin resistance okay that will help you
greatly but for those people that are on the ketogenic diet and you had a blood sugar problem
and you're seeing improvements and you're not eating much carbohydrate but your blood sugars
are still high well now you know why they're high because it's not the dietary sugar your
body is making too much simply because you had insulin resistance and your body is still in
the process of dealing with that and it does take time to reverse insulin resistance it could take
months it could take up to six months to a year to fully resolve that condition the
key is to not give up to stay consistent and to understand what's really going on
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put
a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

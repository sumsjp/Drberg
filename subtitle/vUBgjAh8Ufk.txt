let's talk about black seed it's quite interesting it's been around
for a very long time in many cultures they actually found these black seeds present
in the ancient egyptian tomb of the pharaoh Tutankhamun which is king tut
so the properties of this oil in black seed is quite extensive so let's go to the list
asthma hypertension diabetes pain inflammation antimicrobial anti-fungal antiviral antibacterial
number seven anti-cancer the anti-phytonutrient called thymoquinone it actually causes the
cancer to commit suicide without creating any problem on normal cells it's called apoptosis
there's a study which i'll list below apparently black seed is a significant inhibitor of solid
tumors in mice now the other mechanism of how it deals with cancer which is quite interesting
it says somatostatin analog now let me explain what that means an analog is something that
mimics something and somatostatin is a hormone that lowers or inhibits growth hormone insulin
and glucagon but the black seed oil was the only natural somatostatin analog that i could find
out of a database of thousands and thousands of natural remedies so this right here will create
an anti-cancer effect because it blocks certain pathways that allow the cancer to get its material
its raw material to grow and then we get to number eight anti-convulsant so if someone has a seizure
this could help them all right number nine neural protection so if there's
um a lot of free radical damage or oxidation going on the brain black seed can help counter that so
it's a powerful anti-oxidant all right number 10 it can protect against kidney disease like a
kidney problem from having diabetes or a kidney problem that is developed from a person taking
tylenol antibiotics certain steroids being exposed to lead mercury cadmium aluminum and even morphine
so black seed oil is very very protective on the kidney if someone is in a situation where
they have to take certain medications that have a lot of side effects it's also diuretic
it can also help to inhibit dermatitis which is a skin problem it can help support the immune system
by increasing phagocytosis which are the cells that gobble up and clean up infection and it's
anti-gas so in summary black seed pretty much handles about every single problem that you may
experience thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

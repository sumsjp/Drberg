hey I had another question can kids do in intermittent fasting very good question
absolutely in fact they should especially if they're overweight okay if
you want to help a child lose weight in intermittent fasting is the most powerful
thing the problem is you have to get their agreement because sometimes it's
difficult a lot of kids love to snack and they have to they just cannot snack
I would start with three meals a day and at the meal you're going to have to make
some really good keto bombs or cookies I'll put some links down below and that
way they're not going to be hungry or craving now if you could eventually go
to two meals a day that would be incredible but just make sure those
meals are really nutrient-dense it's not about calories it's about
nutrient-dense so they're going to do large salads to the kale shake with
fruit things like that with a little bit of berries I'm sorry not fruit so you
start off with three meals no snacks and then go down the two mill I would not do
one meal unless the child is really really overweight so on top of that I'm
going to recommend you supplement because a lot of teenagers just don't
consume the balance of nutrients that they need now what if the child's not
overweight and they're in the sports and they're thin what do you do I would
still recommend this I would do three meals a day but I would probably add
some starts because if you don't their metabolism is so fast they're going to
just get too thin I'm talking about adding a red potato yam with butter
wild rice beans sprouted bread it's called Ezekiel bread and I think you'll
actually have a very healthy child okay thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I

symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most
likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a

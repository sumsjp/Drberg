so today we're going to answer the very very vital important question why you should sleep
with a pillow between your legs so number one it can actually reduce your low back pain or
prevent low back pain from occurring because what happens when you lay on your side is your knees
come together and it rotates your hips forward so your spine is not in alignment so if you're
laying there throughout the night several hours or more with your pelvis rotated too forward that's
going to put strain on your lower back and throw out your alignment just enough to create some
distortion in your spine now this can also tug on the largest nerve in the body the sciatic nerve
and also irritate that nerve and number three it can reduce knee pain because if your knees are
held together with pressure that can irritate the knees especially the inside of the knee where you
have the medial meniscus which is probably the most common source of knee pain where you have
either a tear on the medial meniscus or some type of weakness in that area number four it can reduce
hip pain okay and number five it can improve your breathing because if you have sleep apnea or some
type of sinus problem and you're sleeping in your back that alone can reduce the air that travels
through the back of the throat so by sleeping in the side that will increase air going through your
sinuses i would also try to recommend sleeping on your right side instead of left side you may
find that you have a better sleep especially if you have liver problems because the liver
is on the right side so if you sleep on the left side you have this heavy organ that can
somewhat compress the lungs and reduce the air that's traveling through your body so i always
like to sleep on the right side primarily and so that way the lung isn't interfered with the
heavy liver which is about three and a half pounds so try it out it may work for you now as far as
the pillow size i like to use something that is a flatter pillow not too big actually not too small
just enough to raise up the knee so my spine is level so you just want to test that out hey

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to share with you how to
heal your acne I wish I would have known this when I was going through high
school I had really bad skin so I'm going to share with you what to do
there's several factors that will affect the skin but primarily we're going to
talk about the anatomy of something called a sebaceous gland what is a
sebaceous gland it's a little gland on in your skin you have that in your hair
you have them all over the place but you don't have them over the soles of your
feet in different places but basically if this clan is now functioning you will
have acne blackheads whiteheads oily skin dry skin you can have any
combination and so let's start with the vitamin A if your vitamin A is low
you're going to have problems with this gland vitamin A controls and regulates
this gland in your skin so without vitamin A your skin can be really really
bad there's a couple factors you need to know though about what what happens at
the cellular level vitamin A can kill unfriendly bacteria in your skin and so
one of the myths that people have is that they think they have to just scrub
out these blackheads and whiteheads and scrub their face and sterilize your face
that's going to damage your skin that's what I used to do and it was incorrect
because you have a layer of friendly bacteria on your skin that's supposed to
be there to protect you when you scrub too hard you can destroy
that also when you take antibiotics you will destroy it as well so I know people
take antibiotics and their skin gets better but if you can just keep your
good bacteria in your gut healthy you don't have to go that route there's even
a condition I mean a drug called accutane which is a high level of
vitamin synthetic vitamin A which was really good for the skin but it has a
lot of side effects so anytime you take a vitamin in high potencies it comes
with a package there's a lot of problems we don't want to do that we want to take
vitamin A typically in its natural form not synthetic okay I'll show you how to
what to do so but vitamin it can control the bacterial growth
controls the oil coming of the skin the dryness and actually it can get rid of
acne vitamin A foods you know people think of carrots spinach kale anything
orange or yellow that's true but those vitamins in the vegetable family are pre
vitamin A factors they're not active forms so your body has to convert the
pre vitamin A to the active form and it's very difficult for you to but your
body to do that in many cases if you're lucky you might convert four to five
percent so you're really not getting your vitamin A source from the vegetable
you're getting it from the animal products that you eat and that's why a
vegetarian has a lot of dry skin they have vitamin A deficiencies which
is dry eyes can't see at night sinus problems things like that so the best
source of vitamin A that I would recommend a natural source would be cod
liver oil but not just any kind of oil you want to get a colorful oil that is
virgin cod liver oil because when you get traditional inexpensive cheap cod
liver oil you're basically getting a lot of problems you're getting added
vitamins you're getting a heated product that kills off all the good nutrition
it's refined it might have too much of one thing versus the other I don't like
it so there's a lot of problems with just real cheap cholera I would get a
high quality virgin cod liver oil and also as a side note you probably have
heard about the fermented cod liver oil right now I used to buy into that but as
I was studying it I realized you can't ferment cod liver oil
you can't ferment an oil only a carbohydrate so basically it's bogus and
when I bought this stuff it tastes very very fishy because it's when you try to
ferment it you're going to cause rancidity or a souring effect and it's
going to go rancid so the cod liver oil if it's fresh shouldn't shouldn't have a
bad smell but that's a really good source of not just vitamin A but vitamin
D as well which we'll get to also liver personally I don't like
eating liver but I just want you know that liver has a lot about of an A but
of course if you're going to do liver do grass-fed organic don't do just regular
liver and then the other thing is butter Kerrygold butter is a really good source
of grass-fed butter and that has its load with vitamin A that would be a good
source of vitamin A and egg yolks pasture-raised egg yolks that's what I
would recommend I have a lot of those that's really loaded with vitamin A so
vitamin A is very important and regulating the sebaceous gland and
that's the first thing you need to do I don't recommend doing massively high
potency just fractionated vitamin A pills because there's a toxicity problem
with that you're going to create deficiencies and other things okay you
have to really know what you're doing now next thing is low vitamin D vitamin
D is not just for your bones it's not just for your mood it's for your skin
and guess where you get this from the Sun and guess you also can get it from
the cod liver oil so cod liver oil has a nice balance of vitamin D and vitamin A but
Sun and despite what you've been taught about Sun Sun is actually very very
healthy for the skin and it doesn't cause skin cancer
no in fact Sun actually protects you against a lot of types of skin cancer
and other cancers because the vitamin D actually is good for the immune system
now I'm not saying lay out in the Sun and get completely leathered and like
burnt things like that I'm just talking about a little bit of Sun is really good
for the sin skin so but these two are really important and vitamin all the fat
soluble vitamins vitamin A D K there's something unique about them they have
the ability to be stored in fat and also they have the ability to go through the
fat layer of the cell and into the center of the cell where the DNA is and
they can affect the DNA of the cell and control your genes and that's why if
you're deficient in these fats either vitamins you can have a lot of
structural problems with your proteins your
body tissues okay so that's a little bit different than the other water soluble
vitamins like vitamin B things like that so vitamin D vitamin A very important
gallbladder I want to mention that because if a person has a congested
gallbladder or a congested liver or a bad liver or no gallbladder what's going
to happen is that you're not going to have enough bile B I L E bile is a fluid
that kind of helps you break down fats and fat soluble vitamins so if you're
consuming these and your skin is not getting better it could be that you just
don't have enough support from the gallbladder to absorb them into the body
so it's just something I always look at when someone's taking these things
because you need to be able to not just get it but absorb it okay next thing
androgens what is an androgen an androgen is a
hormone produced by your stress gland your adrenal glands on top of your
kidney but it's also produced by the ovary okay and the testicle but mainly
this in a female is coming out of the ovary and that during that time of the
month they might have a little acne because they have a their ratio they
have a little too much energy in versus estrogen so if that happens they'll get
acne I have videos and how to deal with that but guess what triggers androgens
sugar yeah too much sugar so if you were to have a problem with androgens or other
conditions called polycystic ovarian syndrome if you don't know what that is
that's fine but if you if you have it you know what I'm talking about
the best solution for that is to get the sugar down to zero in your diet okay and
that will help you greatly so there's two things that will increase androgens
one is sugar and the other thing is stress okay so sugar and stress really
affect your your skin then we have vitamin b5 what does b5 pantothenic acid
panasonic acid is a vitamin that has that gives you nice clear skin the
problem is people take it synthetically or they take too much of it individually
and then they create deficiencies and other things like biotin and their hair
starts getting brittle so again I'm not saying go out there and start taking
massive dosages just realize that vitamin b5 does control the skin and you
just need to look at what depletes vitamin b5 and that would be stress so
again stress is a factor that we want to start to deal with and lower that to
help your skin the other thing is insulin insulin is a hormone that
regulates blood sugars and insulin is triggered by sugar so and that's also in
the hidden sugars like breads pasta cereal crackers viscous waffles pancakes
muffins sodas juice alcohol all that will influence this gland right here now
these are really comprehensive things but if you have acne you need things
that you can do to better your skin and not be stuck in a situation where you're
taking accutane or some antibiotics so you want to be able to look at all these
to see maybe what's missing in your diet if you're a junk food junkie like I was
then you need to start consuming these foods and get the sugar out of the diet
your skin will clear up nicely the other thing that I'm going to recommend is
that even no vegetables don't have the active form of vitamin A you're going to
have to eat a large quantities to get all the other nutrients the minerals the
other vitamins that make these work and then clean out your liver because you
can't just you know live on cod liver oil you know so I highly recommend you eat
the vegetables as well the combination of that with some of these things
cutting the sugar out trying to avoid the stress as much as possible that can
greatly improve your skin so go ahead and do these things and then write your

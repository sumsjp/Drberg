so today i want to increase your awareness on the term
subclinical okay so let's define what subclinical means
it's a condition where you have very few if any symptoms
and no clinical findings that means you go to the doctor get a blood test
everything comes out normal okay whereas a clinical disease you have
symptoms and you have clinical findings you get a
blood test you find out some problem on your blood
test what i want to tell you is that a lot of health problems
especially the ones right here diabetes hypothyroidism
adrenal disease kidney disease and especially liver disease
start out as a subclinical problem and then
transition into a clinical issue so you have the beginning of a liver problem
or a blood sugar problem years before it shows up with certain testing
now you may notice some slight fatigue stiffness
inflammation but you might consider that normal when in fact it's one of the
symptoms of one of these right here so let's just take diabetes for example
before you become even a pre-diabetic you are you have insulin resistance and
there's a great test it's called homa dash ir
this is rarely ever done by your doctor but it'd be very very important if
diabetes runs in your family because this will pick up
resistance and they're going to measure your insulin levels
okay while you're fasting that's one of the things that they measure
which comes way before you become even a pre-diabetic
or diabetic where you have abnormal blood sugars
so this would be a test that's rarely done that would pick up
the beginning part of diabetes basically you can call it subclinical
diabetes now when we get into hypothyroidism i
believe doing a hair analysis from a credible
lab would give you some very important information about
the selenium status zinc status and iodine status of the entire body
which may not show up in your blood because when you're low on selenium and
zinc and iodine it can turn into a hypothyroid condition
also high levels of estrogen let's say you
have heavy periods or you're taking birth control pills
things like that that could lead to a hypothyroid condition
or if you have liver problems you had your gallbladder removed
you're low in bile that could eventually lead into a hypothyroid
condition because it's important to understand
the evolution of these body conditions what
causes these conditions and that's the best way to do it is to avoid those
things that can potentially cause these problems this right here is the
chronic consumption of carbohydrates eating too frequently this could be a
mineral deficiency or it could be stress or it can be too
much exposure to fluoride for example now when you check the blood for certain
minerals especially potassium and magnesium
uh rarely will it show up being a problem in the blood because
98 or 99 of those two minerals are inside the cell so you have to
understand that and know what tests to do because a blood test might not be the
best thing in that case maybe you want to do an
intracellular mineral test i'll put a link down below of a good
company that i've used in the past and this will pick up mineral
deficiencies which could then lead into heart
arrhythmia problems down the road a cac
scan test coronary artery calcification test where you're measuring
calcium inside the artery is a very good test to predict heart attacks down the
road not that expensive pretty quick you want
a score of a zero another good test to
look at the deeper areas of your lipids cholesterol
hdl ldl would be the advanced lipid testing which would
give you a much better picture of what's going on
inside the arteries because this is going to measure the type of ldl
that would not create artery damage and the type of ldl that would create
damage in the inside of the arteries now with adrenal disease a lot of times
adrenal problems do not show up until the majority of the
gland is destroyed especially with a condition called addison's which is an
autoimmune condition so one test to pick this up would be an
antibody test to the adrenal glands so you may have
the symptoms of adrenal issues but when you
do a blood test like nothing shows up with your hormones
and this is very very common with any hormone problems
i believe they all start out subclinically and then they eventually
turn into a clinical problem and so you really have to be
aware of the mechanism because if you don't know
that and you put all your focus on this blood test
yet you ignore these other symptoms that could be related
and really don't understand the subclinical part of it
then you could really miss a problem because you're not handling a problem
before it becomes a bigger problem kidney disease is a common subclinical
issue one indicator is creatine on a blood
test your kidney has to be pretty severely
damaged before that shows up so you may have normal indicators on a
blood test yet have this start of a kidney disease
a huge percentage of kidney disease starts with insulin resistance and blood
sugar problems so again if you understand the mechanism
and the evolution of what causes what you can even avoid these issues right
here instead of waiting to become diagnosed liver disease
your liver is very robust and 90% of liver can be literally damaged yet
you have no symptoms at all a really good
indicator for a fatty liver would be a gut so a lot of times people look at
you know having a large gut that's normal thing everyone has it it's not a
problem and not realizing that the liver is so
fatty that the fat now is spilling over in other organs around the organs in
your mid section and they're not connecting the
dots between a fatty liver and gut fat so you may not have other
symptoms but you may have a gut and that means you have a fatty liver
when i was in practice i sent five of my patients to the radiologist
for ultrasounds of their liver and five out
of five of these men that i sent over for this evaluation
had significant amounts of fat in their liver
so let's learn from the mistakes of others and avoid
these problems over here by getting on a healthy keto
and an intermittent fasting program if you're new to my channel i put a link
down below of exactly what you should be doing
thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin
keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

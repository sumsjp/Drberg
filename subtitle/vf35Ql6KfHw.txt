did you realize that your body cannot make vitamins but your microbe sure can
your microbes your friendly bacteria the good flora in your gut are vitamin
making machines on steroids they make a lot of vitamins and they make vitamin K
which actually has everything to do with stopping bleeding and any vitamin that
your body makes means that it is important
there's something about bleeding internally that is very very unhealthy so
this is one of the reasons why your body makes vitamin K to prevent that from
occurring also they can make vitamin b12 which is all about supporting your
nervous system if you're deficient it b12 you could have some permanent nerve
damage it's also about supporting your blood if you're deficient in b12 you can
become anemic your body makes a vitamin b1 it's probably one of the most
important water soluble vitamins because its effect on the nervous system the
brain the heart most people are deficient simply because they're on a
high carb sugar refined carbohydrate diet they're consuming a lot of grains
refined grains that deplete b1 and then they start developing anxiety attention
problems panic attacks and other issues if you want to know more about b1 just
take a look at all the symptoms from berry berry which I put that video down
below but even though someone might not have the classical huge deficiency of B
b1 how beriberi they could have a subclinical version of b1 so they're
deficient but not by a large amount just enough to create irritation to the
nervous system to affect the person's mood to put them in a nervous state of
anxiety but b1 is also important in memory in certain parts of the brain and
also in the heart okay the microbes also make vitamin b2 which helps you break
down proteins carbohydrates and fats to turn that into energy so it's involved
in the little energy factories called the mitochondria
also it will make vitamin b3 which has to do with helping you regulate
cholesterol supporting brain function and joint health it too is involved in
the production of energy in the mitochondria your microbes make b5 which is
a coenzyme and a lot of biochemical reactions including making protein it
also supports the adrenal gland and helping you make adrenaline and
noradrenaline also b6 is made by microbes a lot of women take b6 for PMS
symptoms also if they're pregnant and they get swelling and edema b6 will push
the fluid out b6 is also good for carpal tunnel syndrome so it's good for the
nervous system your microbes make biotin I did a separate video on that I'll put
that link down below a biotin is about the formation of protein and the
formation of certain fatty acids in the body so it's important in hair nails and
skin so if there's something not right with your gut you could be deficient in
all these right here all right full late but folate will protect your DNA it's
also involved in the formation of making DNA but your body can't make vitamins
but your microbes can these are some of the microbes that make these B vitamins
and you can get these from consuming fermented foods especially sauerkraut
that would be a really good source so your microbes help you in many many
different ways they make vitamins they make enzymes to help detoxify they make
acids that give you energy from the food that you give them which is fiber also
they make amino acids that turn into neurotransmitters that then help you
with your mood and your brain focus and your cognitive function also certain
microbes in the small intestine have the ability to make lactase which is an
enzyme to help break down milk sugar lactose
there's also enzymes within the small intestine that make that enzyme but
you get older that tends to go away so this explains why probably half the
population is lactose-intolerant but anyway it's not just about eating
healthy it's about preserving the friendly guys that can help you make
vitamins so you can be healthy thanks for watching and check out this video on
the digestive system that explains the whole thing from A to Z

let's talk about your menstrual cycle did you know that you can use the ketogenic diet to get
your period back on track or back to normal women who have missed three menstrual cycles in a row
have a condition called amenorrhea and this could stem from many different things it
could be a nutritional deficiency it could be that they're losing weight in an unhealthy way
it could be weight gain because too much fat can actually make too much estrogen
it could be some hormonal disruption or some endocrine disruption chemicals in the environment
it could be stress where you have a higher amount of the sympathetic
nervous system and low parasympathetic or it could be that you have diabetes or pre-diabetes now
here's what you need to know insulin resistance is a huge cause of amenorrhea now what happens when
you have insulin resistance you have too much insulin okay now what's the connection between
high insulin and amenorrhea well high insulin suppresses something in your liver
called shbg it stands for sex hormone binding globulin that is a compound that helps carry
protein to sex organs when you have high insulin you're going to have low shvg and that's going
to suppress your sex hormones causing you not to have a menstrual cycle all right what's the
relationship between the ketogenic diet well the ketogenic diet lowers insulin it helps fix insulin
resistance and you do it through two ways you lower your carbohydrates and you do intermittent
fasting there's quite a few other benefits of running your body on ketones in relationship to
your menstrual cycle okay number one ketones lower inflammation and directly increase fertility
all right number two ketones improve the hpa axis hypothalamus pituitary adrenal what does that mean
it means that ketones help take you out of the flight or fight mechanism they help you lower
stress all right next one number three ketones help balance your neurotransmitters especially
gaba and gaba calms you down it helps lower the flight or fight mechanism and you probably realize
now stress is not good for female hormones or your menstrual cycle or fertility when your body
is in stress mode and being chased by the tiger and trying to survive it doesn't have time to be
fertile or go through a menstrual cycle all right and lastly ketones support your brain it just so
happens your hypothalamus is located in your brain and by getting on ketones you can directly improve
the hypothalamus and that's where it all starts as far as the control of your ovaries you have a
certain hormone called the gonadotropin releasing hormone that's released by the hypothalamus and
then it tells the pituitary to release two other additional hormones called luteinizing hormone
and follicular stimulating hormone and those two hormones go down to the ovary to help you regulate
your menstrual period so if you're new to my channel and you don't know about keto
i put a link down below of exactly how to do it in a healthy way

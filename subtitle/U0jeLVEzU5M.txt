i wanted to do a video on emphasizing a certain point related to the thyroid gland
if you're supplementing iodine for the thyroid do not forget selenium it's just as important the
enzymes that allow you to convert t4 the inactive form of the thyroid hormone to t3 the active form
it involves selenium so selenium has a crucial role in maintaining normal thyroid physiology and
also i wanted to mention a study which i'm going to link down below that demonstrated this iodine
given alone in selenium-deficient animals was found to cause irreversible thyroid gland fibrosis
so potentially if you're deficient in selenium and you are using iodine not in a blend like sea kelp
but just as a supplement iodine without selenium it could make things worse and also check this
next part out which actually opposes this first concept selenium given alone in iodine-deficient
animals was found to cause an aggravation of the iodine deficiency and there's a whole series of
symptoms related to iodine deficiency in the study which you can read down below
the point of this study is that you should always take iodine with selenium best source would be
sea kelp something that has all the trace minerals including selenium and iodine
one last point one of the most important antioxidants in the body especially in your liver
is glutathione vital and it is dependent on selenium so selenium is a trace mineral
involved in a lot of enzyme reactions not just in the thyroid but in your liver as well
if you haven't seen my other videos on selenium i put them up right here check them out

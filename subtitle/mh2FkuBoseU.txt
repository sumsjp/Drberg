so i want to talk about knee pain and tight calfs now especially when you get knee pain in the front
part just underneath the patella or the kneecap sometimes they call this patellar tendonitis
now the patella is a kneecap and there's a tendon attached to the top part of that bone
which is then connected to your quadricep muscles on your front part of your thigh so this is
usually caused by tight calf muscles now sometimes it could be tight hamstrings but most of the time
it's going to be a tight calf muscle and you're going to have a difficulty of bringing your foot
upwards okay so when you bring your foot upward that's called dorsiflexion so you won't be able
to do that as well why because your calf is tight so there's an interesting 2011 study that shows
that when you have reduced dorsiflexion which is tight calves that is going to increase your risk
of getting patellar tendonitis by a factor of 16x so you want to avoid that condition because that's
going to affect your ability to run jump and do other types of motion so what is the solution
stretch the calf muscle so to stretch the calf muscle you can just go on your stairs either
going downstairs or going upstairs and put the front part of your foot on one of the steps and
then start stretching the calves or better yet you can start stretching your calves on a slant board
and after you do that for a few days i would add another exercise and i would start to do this
statically in other words not on a step or on the slant board you take a small pillow put it between
the knees and then you take both of your knees and actually draw a circle clockwise okay about
10 times and then draw a circle counterclockwise now doing this exercise you are going to
help the dorsiflexion but you're going to do it in a coordinated way then you can actually do this on
the slant board to increase even more coordinated activity while you're stretching it at the same
time now if you want more information about the stretch check out the video i put down below so

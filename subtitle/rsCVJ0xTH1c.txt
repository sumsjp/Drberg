i'm going to show you the best the
absolute best stretch for your psoas
muscle
what is the psoas muscle well it's the
only muscle that connects the upper part
of your body with the lower part and if
you have a tight psoas chances are
you're going to have low back pain
chances are you're going to have poor
posture
chances are your hips are not going to
work correctly without a psoas you're
going to have a heck of a time
getting out of bed it's virtually almost
impossible to get out of bed in the
morning
standing up from a seated position will
be difficult
uh walking running will be impossible
now if the psoas is tight
keeping your posture
erect keeping your upper body over your
lower body without going forward is
going to be an issue because
the muscle i'm going to show you what
this looks like right here the psoas
attaches from the lumbar spine as well
as the last thoracic vertebra it comes
through your pelvis
to your your upper leg okay so what it
does is it causes the lower leg to come
up towards the chest okay
so let's see if you can see this right
here so this is what it does right here
it's a hip
flexor
now your thigh muscles are also hip
flexors but the psoas is the most
powerful it's a very large muscle
and without this motion i mean think
about it you can't can't walk can't run
you can't climb up the stairs so it's a
it could be a major major problem if
it's not working correctly personally i
had a tight solus without really even
knowing it was tight
but it manifest as low back pain because
i used to run my bike for miles and
miles and miles up hills and that was
really the only exercise i was doing for
about 10 years and so you can imagine
i really built up my hip flexors
but i didn't
work on the opposite muscles the other
thing i did at the same time
was a lot of sitting i mean i would
basically sit all day long unless i was
at my office and
that's just a killer for the psoas
because it keeps it in that contracted
state
i'm just curious how many hours do you
sit per day go ahead and put that in the
comments because with myself i think i
was sitting for at least 10 hours a day
i mean that's just way too long to sit
so what happens when the psoas becomes
too tight it it really throws off a lot
of other muscles including your glute
muscles
and everything starts compensating and
you can watch people who have a tight
psoas they usually are tilted forward so
usually a person will have a tight psoas
on one side more than the other side
and it's really important to
fix that and keep them both symmetrical
it'll give you so much relief with your
low back and i'm going to walk you
through a real simple exercise that i
figured out
after trying a lot of things that didn't
work
and there's just three simple steps
and not only am i going to show you how
to stretch it out but also to strengthen
it
and also to stabilize it okay so it also
involves
several other muscles and also your
upper body
so let's just dive right in and show you
exactly how to do this
all right this is basically what you're
going to do you're going to
hyperextend okay one side at a time
we'll start with my left side
and take that psoas muscle and not just
stretch it but we're gonna stabilize it
and strengthen it all at the same time
so grab a chair at first you know you're
going to have to probably go at your own
pace but you're going to scissors your
legs and come right down
and keep your upper body
as straight as possible
and then
take your left leg
and straighten out your knee if possible
okay so now
i'm squatting down with my right leg
which is not easy when you first start
out so of course go at your own pace
okay
so we're holding on to a chair and we're
just stretching this and you're just
gonna count for ten okay you're going to
just do this for 10 seconds
and then you're going to do the opposite
side
now
when you do this
you're going to notice which leg
or which muscle is tighter left or right
and obviously you're going to spend a
little more time on the area that's
tight right and so what we're trying to
do is we're trying to get symmetry
between the left and right side as well
as
strengthening the whole dynamic because
these muscles do not work
in isolation okay they work together
so if we're doing this side and you do
this for a period of time where you're
comfortable
then what you do is do step two which is
simply you're raising your arm
okay now what we're going to do is we're
going to stretch
all the muscles and ligaments that are
in the fascia that's connected
to the opposite side okay
so you'll do that for 10 seconds okay
and then do the opposite side
over a period of time when that becomes
easier you add one more layer to this
which is you just bring both arms up
without any type of assistance from the
chair
and you just focus on your form and your
stabilization and you hold that for 10
to 20 seconds and you're really just
trying to do this until you can do this
comfortably now
over a course of like two or three weeks
you're going to find that when you walk
your pelvis your hips
your gait
is now free and open you're going to
find that your low back pain is
completely gone it frees up a lot of
tightness in your hips
and at the same time you're going to
find that your low back curve
is now in a good position where you
actually have a nice cushion in your
lower back so it's going to be overall
very very stabilized now if you haven't
seen my first video on the psoas muscle
you should check that out because i go
through a series of things to test to
see if you need to stretch it so i put
it up right here check it out

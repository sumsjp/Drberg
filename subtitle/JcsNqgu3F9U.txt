this is a very interesting topic i found the study that demonstrated
that you could actually reduce your liver fat by almost 50 in just two
weeks and i'm not kidding this is not a joke this is a credible study there's a 14-day intervention
study putting people on a carbohydrate restrictive diet this is called the ketogenic diet where they
consumed less than 30 grams of carbohydrates per day and this demonstrated decreased liver fat
by 43.8 percent so it's not actually 50 but it's close in subjects with obesity and
what is that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease now there are several other interesting things
about this number one there wasn't much weight loss on average there was only like a 1.8 percent
weight loss which is pretty insignificant and there is no change in waist circumference now
this is very good information to know because if you started a ketogenic diet and you lost
hardly any weight the first week and there's no change in your waste
you might just quit and think it's not working apparently the body gets rid of liver fat
and organ fat as a priority before it goes after other types of fat
and apparently the loss of liver fat was due to decreased something called d noble lipogenesis
what is that that means there's a greatly reduced conversion from carbohydrates to fat there's like
a 79.8 percent decrease so no longer are we getting this conversion from carbohydrates
to fat and there was also an increase in actual overall fat burning called fatty acid oxidation
by just under 5x so we had this five times greater fat oxidation or fat burning effect
in the liver amazing now there's some also very interesting additional things on this study
first of all the participants did not lower their calories the average amount of calories
per day was over three thousand so this was not a globe calorie diet there was also significant
lower markers for liver damage significant lower fasting insulin levels and lowered homa ir which
means there was less insulin resistance there was improved insulin sensitivity there was lower
liver inflammation and there was a rapid increase in folate producing bacteria and folate in their
blood so apparently in the ketogenic diet your microbes make more folate now what is up with this
folate what does the folate do in relationship to your liver well it improves liver fat
metabolism and it keeps liver inflammation on the low side and they found 94 bacterial strains
were altered after going on this low carb diet with major shifts in microbes occurring
just in one day if you're new to my channel or you're not new you've been watching my videos and
you haven't started ketogenic diet i think this right here is a good enough reason to get started
right away so i put a link down below the exact version of the ketogenic diet you need to start
immediately check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

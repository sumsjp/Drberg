i've been talking a lot lately about vitamin d but i've been neglecting
vitamin k2 so this video is on k2 vitamin k2
is quite amazing it inhibits vascular and joint calcification
it keeps your joints and your arteries from becoming
bone so vitamin k2 which is a fat soluble vitamin
activates an inhibitory protein it's called matrix gla protein and so
what this protein does is it stops it's like the brake
pads okay it stops calcium from forming in the
arteries and in your joints vitamin k2 also
helps form bone it makes your bones more mineralized okay so it makes the bones
stronger vitamin k2 decreases
insulin resistance now we know insulin resistance is involved
in damaging the arteries that's causing the calcification in the first place
as well as the inflammation the joints which is behind arthritis
and bursitis and tendinitis so vitamin k2 is extremely powerful
in not just keeping the calcium out of the wrong place
but putting it back in the right place as well
as inhibiting the very root cause of why it's there in the first place so
it's very very powerful you want to take vitamin d3
with k2 so if you're going to take 10,000 IUs
of vitamin d3 we want k2 at 100 micrograms
okay that's the ratio that i would recommend
now this is mk7 there's many different types of vitamin
k2 this video is not going to be on that
topic but let's talk about what food you
should be eating to raise your vitamin k2
liver animal liver which also includes pate right here goose pate
has some of the highest levels of k2 fermented foods have vitamin k2
especially nato which is a japanese fermented soybean product
nato has not just mk and mk is just a version of k2 mk4
mk5 mk6 mk7 and 8 so it has a lot of different types
of k2 grass-fed meat has vitamin k2
egg yolks have vitamin k2 hard and soft cheese has the mk4 version
the 5 the 6 seven eight and the nine salami has vitamin k2
make sure you get the version that does not have
sugar or dextrose i found one from the health food store so that's the one i
consume and sauerkraut has k2 it has a lot of
different types the mk 4 5 6 7 8 and 9.
and grass fed butter has k2 it has the version 4 5 6 7 8 9 as well
so it's quite comprehensive so in summary you can see how vitally
important k2 is for a lot of different things

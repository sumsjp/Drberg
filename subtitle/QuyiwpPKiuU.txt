let's talk about vitamin d and skin type and when i'm talking about type i'm talking about the
pigment in your skin the pigment is generated by melanin and melanin the pigment has an interesting
function of acting as a filter for uv light so it actually prevents uv light
and it also prevents the harmful rays that can cause cancer so the more melanin you
have in your skin the more protected you are from skin cancer now the largest organ
in the body is the skin it has about 22 square feet okay it's about 8 pounds so it's actually
quite large when we get into the types of skin you have type one and two you have type three and
you have type four five and six so in this type you have people that have like a fair complexion
people that are redheads russians scandinavians and people that live in high latitude which means
further away from the equator and then type three you have the middle latitude which is slightly
lower we have americans and central europeans okay then you have type four five and six
which is the subtropical or the tropical they're closer to the equator and so they're going to
have more sun exposure and this group includes asians indians latino americans african-americans
africans and so the darker the skin the more melanin the more natural sunscreen they have
the less uvs that are going to penetrate the skin but here's the catch-22 people in this group that
have a less risk of getting skin cancer also have a greater risk of being vitamin d deficient
so they would need between three to five times more vitamin d than this group so even though
this group can absorb more vitamin d they have a high risk of getting skin cancer and so the darker
the skin the more vitamin d you need to consume or be exposed to from sun normally the sun gives you
uv radiation which hits the skin and depending on how much pigment you have will determine how much
pre vitamin d you're going to get which is made from cholesterol this inactive pre vitamin d
needs to be activated through the kidneys or the liver but also realize that if there is
damage to your liver whether you have a fatty liver it's inflamed or you have cirrhosis or
you have kidney damage because you're diabetic it never gets converted so when you get tested
and it shows normal that doesn't actually tell you the active form because most tests check the
inactive vitamin d not the active version because if you have a fatty liver or you have some type of
a problem with your kidney and you keep checking your vitamin d and it's normal
chances are you it might not be normal so there's a big association between liver damage
or kidney damage and low vitamin d levels now there's a really cool test that i recommend it's a
home kit that you can get to measure your vitamin d levels it's not that expensive i recently called
the company and i asked them if they would give my followers a discount and i don't get any kickbacks
i get no percentage of this so what they agreed to do is give all my followers 20% off this test
if you're interested so you would just type in this coupon code drberg20 and i put the link
down below they'll send you a kit you take a drop of blood you put in this little piece of paper
send it in and they'll give you your results they also have some other additional testing
like omega-3 fatty acid testing they can check your dha i think just a few more tests
so you'll see it on their website all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

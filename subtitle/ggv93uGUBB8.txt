let's talk about the health benefits of cacao and dark chocolate now cacao is the raw bean
that's then fermented and processed into chocolate okay but there are some serious health benefits to
both of these items in fact six billion pounds is consumed on a yearly basis it is loaded with some
serious phytonutrients polyphenols and flavonols which is more in quantity than blueberries or
acai berries now there's a tiny bit of caffeine involved but you have a good amount of theobromine
which is a stimulant so of course if you're going to consume this later in the day or before bed
that may keep you up now i consume a little bit of chocolate on a regular basis not too much but
i always consume no sugar type chocolate i always make sure that it's organic because they do spray
different chemicals including using glyphosate i primarily use these two brands right here there's
other ones that you can get as well but they're usually flavored with erythritol and monk fruit
or stevia so there's quite a variety that you can choose from all right let's look at the
benefits of cacao and dark chocolate there's some seriously amazing benefits for the heart
decrease blood pressure because you're getting increased nitric oxide which actually helps the
smooth muscle of the arteries now the blood pressure effect can also happen due to the
high levels of magnesium it's also loaded with iron and potassium and copper and phosphorus and
zinc number two it can increase your hdl decrease your ldl especially the oxidized ldl number three
major studies showing the decrease in risk of heart disease okay this is the big one right here
decreasing endothelial dysfunction this is where heart disease starts it's the inside of the layer
of the artery specifically the coronary that starts to become damaged and then the
cholesterol comes and the calcium comes and builds up plaquing and a clot and so these antioxidants
protect the inside layer of the artery of course if you consume chocolate without the
sugar which is like you know sandpaper on the arteries all right number four decreasing cortisol
and adrenaline this is why many times people consume chocolate to reduce stress
all right number five it may decrease the risk of certain cancers number six decreasing insulin
improves insulin resistance okay number seven you can decrease the risk of strokes
number eight it can elevate your mood and bring someone from a depressed state to a higher level
they don't know exactly why this is it could be because of the increase in serotonin it could be
because of the theobromine but it can also be from the polyphenols okay but regardless it
seems to create a cool effect number nine it can increase your physical performance
ten it can really help the skin's circulation probably because of this nitric oxide right here
the texture of your skin the hydration of your skin and number eleven which is quite amazing
which relates to number three it can decrease metabox syndrome which is a combination of
improving your blood sugars cholesterol and blood pressure the only thing i want
to mention about cacao or chocolate is that it does have higher amounts of oxlets
and so if you're at risk for kidney stones i would probably recommend not consuming it hey before

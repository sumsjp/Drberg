hey i'm back and today we're going to talk about snacking when you're doing
keto you don't want to do it and i want to
talk about why okay so we're going to talk about keto
snacking tell you so many people are messing up on this one
and everyone now is creating these keto snacks so you have
the beef sticks you have the protein bars
you have the keto bombs you got the keto cookies
you got the chocolate you got the nuts you got a keto ice cream
berries and cream etc etc etc here's the problem guys um and girls
it's going to decrease your results significantly you're not going to get
results you're going to plateau what is the goal of keto
it is simply to decrease insulin that's the main goal
to help normalize insulin and i'm assuming you know this but i'm just
going to assume that you don't know this right now
every time you eat anything of significant calories
you will spike insulin so insulin is increased when you eat
carbohydrates and when you eat anything
so what does that mean it means that the more frequent the meals
the more the insulin the less progress you're going to make not just with
weight loss with your overall health i had this
person recently contact me and they just don't
understand why their blood sugar is high in keto
and then i find out they're doing quite a few snacks
and but it's everything's keto so that's where the real problem is so
anything that you eat now let's say for example you eat
something low with low calories like vegetables
that would be something that would be okay it's not going to spike insulin too
much especially if it's like filled with
fiber like leafy greens so that would be something as an
exception because it's low calories now the other point i want to
make is this so let's say you're doing intermittent fasting
and your first meal is at 12 noon and the second meal
is at seven o'clock in the evening but you have a snack and you know what
you might say this is my eating window so i can pretty much
graze or eat or snack within this period of time
i don't recommend it i don't recommend eating
anything within your eating window other than the first meal
and the second meal okay now what's going to happen after the
second meal is you don't want to snack after that
you want to let yourself fast from that point all the way
to the next morning to the next meal i would recommend that you work up
to an 18-hour fast to really see some significant and changes some people need
to go up to 20 hours some people need to go up to about 23
hours of fasting that's going to produce some major major
results all these keto snacks and the keto bombs a lot of them are
okay just eat them as a dessert or
during the meal okay thanks for watching hey we're back with another amazing

let's talk about leg and foot cramps at night call this nocturnal cramps what's behind these and what
can you do about them i will say that they can be extremely painful they can completely keep you up
at night and really create so much pain that you can't get back to sleep and it can start from just
flexing your toe and so you're like grabbing your toe and trying to push it back and it's
it can be a nightmare so here's the thing there's not a lot of data on this condition
they just don't know what causes it it could potentially be an electrolyte imbalance with the
deficiency of magnesium calcium potassium or even sodium but many times the person will start taking
electrolytes and they don't feel any difference it can also be a problem in your ph your body is too
alkaline that's right too alkaline not too acid if your body is on the alkaline side you won't
be able to transport minerals properly and that can create all sorts of problems from twitching
underneath your eye or even cramping in which case you'd want to just acidify the body but the
three things i'm going to recommend for nocturnal cramps are number one quinine now i'm not talking
about the drug quinine i'm talking about the natural version from something called cinchona officinalis
this is a natural remedy that you can get online or at the health food store
and start taking that it has a very high degree of success and so you might want to try that you may
also try tonic water which sometimes has quinine in that as well so that is my top recommendation
and there's a few other things you can try as well yellow mustard seems to work good for cramps you'd
want to take one tablespoon of this mustard before bed and the last thing i would recommend would be
simply apple cider vinegar two tablespoons in some water maybe an hour before bed can really help you
because that's gonna acidify the body and that will help you absorb minerals into your muscles

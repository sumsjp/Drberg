hi I'm back and we're gonna answer the question why is it that someone could
potentially have high blood sugar in the morning when they're absolutely eating
no sugar whatsoever that's very very weird and sometimes when a person then
eats their first meal the sugar comes down so what's going on with that well
actually this is what's happening your liver is making the sugar and the name
for that is called gluconeogenesis Genesis means make neo means new gluco
means sugar so the liver is making new sugar out of either protein or ketones
or fat another term for that is called de novo of synthesis of glucose so your
body is making it without it coming from the diet now the question is why does
that occur now just so you know a little bit of that is a normal body response in
other words everyone has a little bit of this going on due to several hormone
fluctuations that occur as a circadian wave throughout the night and the day so
it involves growth hormone adrenaline and cortisol and to a very small degree
you're going to have blood sugar fluctuations through the night into the
day and when you have too much of that it's called a dawn phenomena where you
wake up and your blood sugar is too high that's because you have insulin
resistance insulin resistance makes this condition a lot worse it exaggerated s'
the condition where you're waking up and your blood glucose is a hundred and
twenty and it really has to do with insulin insulin is a hormone that stores
fat it's also supposed to block this from happening right here when you have
insulin resistance you're not absorbing insulin in the cells so in certain
places of your body you don't have enough insulin in other places you have
too much so this really is an insulin deficiency because insulin is supposed
to suppress the production of glucose alright that being said let's just talk
about normal blood sugars normally you should have a blood sugar about eighty
now what does that mean that means that if we take all of your blood in your
body the amount of sugar that would be dissolved in all of your blood if you
had your blood sugars about eighty would be one level teaspoon of sugar five
grams of sugar for every ten points that your blood sugar goes up from 80 to a 90
that's an increase of a half a gram so when your blood sugar is 120 that means
you have an extra two grams of sugar in all of your blood it's not an outrageous
amount of sugar so this would be a little less than a half a teaspoon of
sugar so right there you should know that this is not a serious situation and
you're not going to start to create a lot of problems throughout the body
because your body is making it there's an imbalance how can we correct this
number one you just have to realize that it's going to take more time okay
you have insulin resistance so just keep doing what you're doing and give it more
time and I'm talking about doing keto and intermittent fasting by the book it
over time you'll see it'll get better and better and better you could also
take things to speed up the process like potassium magnesium zinc and vitamin b12
all of these will help you speed up the resolution of insulin resistance and the
last thing you can do and you can do this in the morning when you wake up you
can go for a nice walk walking for about 20 minutes should easily burn off this
extra sugar you can do other workouts as well alright thanks for watching

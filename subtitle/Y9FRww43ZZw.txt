in this video I'm going to talk about the relationship between rat poison
vitamin K and strokes so there's a medication that a lot of people are on
it's called coumadin and what that is is it it has a function of blocking vitamin
K which basically will stop that stop the clots in their body and prevent
strokes it sounds pretty great I mean it seems helpful of someone stroking etc
like we don't want to stroke right but my problem is how it's done the
ingredients in Coumadin are the same ingredients and rat poison in fact if
you feed it to a rat it causes the rat to bleed internally because it stops the
clotting mechanism so it's kind of like a poison and they're giving it to people
right the problem is vitamin K is in a lot of leafy green foods and they can't
recommend these patients consuming vitamin K vegetables so they can't do
the kale they can't do the wheatgrass juice you can't do some of these
vegetables so the exact foods that are designed to heal them to help them they
can't do that so that's a huge problem alright so Mike whole question is this
why what causes this this stroke what causes the clotting not the stroke but
what causes the clotting in the first place that makes them put them on the
Coumadin so I've been doing some research on a lot of patients that come
in and I always ask them a question when did you first notice that you started
clotting like an embolism in your lung whatever and what occurred it was always
connected to a stress event always 100% of the time and so then I looked up
stress hormones I looked up adrenaline and I found out there's a relationship
between high adrenaline and fiber gen which basically is the clotting factor
so when you go through stress your body clots more because if you chop off your
arm and you're stressed out it's going to go ahead and stop the bleeding it's a
natural protective mechanism I'm just basically created a video to
show to connect the dots so I hope you appreciate this video and just realize
that you know you got to get to the root you have to find a cause and you can't
just treat the symptom always so I will see you in the next video

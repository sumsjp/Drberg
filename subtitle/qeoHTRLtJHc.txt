so let's talk about the importance of vitamin E in muscle function especially
when you exercise now vitamin E is typically known as an antioxidant
especially for the inner surface of your arteries in fact having enough vitamin E
in the layer of your arteries can prevent the accumulation of platelets and
clotting factors and all sorts of things that could build up that could
potentially clog your arteries but it's there to prevent the oxidation okay of
certain things like high blood sugar chemicals that destroy the layer of your
blood vessel because as soon as you have damage there you start having
cholesterol and calcium come in to patch this up and then things start getting
out of hands vitamin E deficiency is usually one of the first things to occur
on the chain of events because if you don't have enough vitamin E things start
to oxidize and build up vitamin E will also support the retina and the
complications from diabetes that affect the retina like retinopathy which
basically are dysfunctions of the retina or diseases of the retina when you get
diabetes you have a high amount of sugar flowing through the bloodstream the
vitamin E will also help peripheral nerves and supporting them and
preventing the damage that can occur from other things one of the most
important things that vitamin E can do is support the skeletal muscle membranes
okay now think about this when you exercise you're actually adding stress
to the body you're tearing down muscle tissue another tissue connective tissue
and then your body repairs so you tear and repair you're actually tearing down
at the microscopic level your membranes and vitamin E is very essential in that
repair action if you don't have enough vitamin E either it's not going to heal
right or it's going to heal with scar tissue so we're gonna get a slow
recovery for deficient in vitamin e we get muscle
weakness we get muscle myopathies which is a dysfunction of muscle and that
could be a lot of different things if you're taking all the electrolytes for
cramping and your legs or anywhere in your body it's not working
take vitamin E and I'm not talking about taking a synthetic version of vitamin E
and talking about a natural complex of vitamin e not just the tocopherols which
there are seven of them like alpha would be one of them but also the tocotrienols
all those together would form the vitamin E complex that makes vitamin E
very functional if you take just one synthetic fractionated part of the
vitamin E complex you may not see the benefit reducing cramps can be improved
with vitamin E also if you have muscle stiffness and muscle spasm on one side
note in absorption of vitamin E is you need a good liver and you need a good
gallbladder if you don't have a gallbladder or you have a dysfunctional
gallbladder or even fatty liver you could be deficient in bile and because
vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin not having a bile can prevent the absorption
of vitamin E in that case you would want to take some bile as a extra thing to
help you absorb vitamin E the other ways that you could be deficient about a mini
of course not consuming enough vitamin E in the diet but also having some type of
malabsorption problem because you had some type of pre-existing damage in the
colon itself so now there's scar tissue you had history of antibiotics or
whatever and now you have gut damage you can't absorb it so that's another
challenge you're gonna have to overcome all right number three reduces the
ability of your muscles to contract now that has to do with the strength of the
muscle I remember in practice people coming in with weak muscles and a huge
difficulty of exercising without becoming
really fast I would always recommend a complete vitamin E complex and it's
amazing how much more endurance they'll have so if you have a reduced ability
for muscles to contract because your vitamin E deficient you're gonna get
muscle fatigue so you're not going to have the endurance of exercise your
performance with exercise will be poor you have tearing going on or breakdown
in the muscle tissue but without enough repair so then you develop scar tissue
and this is one of the reasons why people will rub wheatgerm oil or vitamin E
on a scar because it can break down some of the scar tissue vitamin E
can help reduce cramping especially of your heart apparently has something to
do with increasing the amount of oxygen to the tissue to allow the muscle
physiology to contract correctly and relax correctly and one additional thing
about that if you're also deficient in vitamin b1 you'll develop a lot of
excess lactic acid as in restless leg syndrome but that lactic acid could
be anywhere in the muscle you do need vitamin E and vitamin b1 and it just so
happens that both of them are usually depleted when you're on a high
carbohydrate diet I'm talking about refined foods refined flour products
okay like the bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits pancakes things like
that and high fructose corn syrup which is refined sugar and what food is high
in the vitamin E complex you have wheat germ okay you have leafy greens
sunflower seeds almonds vitamin E is in a lot of additional foods but if you
exercise on a regular basis and you want to improve your strength and decrease
the fatigue and improve your endurance definitely apply the information in this
video and if you want to know a little bit more about vitamin E I put a video
up right here

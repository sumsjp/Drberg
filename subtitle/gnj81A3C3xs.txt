welcome back today we're going to talk about the thyroid i have some interesting information i'm
going to try to keep this really really simple if you have a thyroid problem this video is for you
i've done a lot of videos in the past on the thyroid this one comes in at a
slightly different angle okay so we have two different situations with the thyroid we have
a thyroid condition we have not enough hormones it's called a hypothyroidism and then a condition
where you have too many hormones that's called a hyper thyroidism okay now with a hypo 90
of the time it's going to be hashimoto's that's an autoimmune issue with a hyper thyroid issue
80 of the time it's going to also be an autoimmune condition called graves disease okay so that's
the first thing you need to know um most of these conditions are autoimmune conditions so
they're really not thyroid as much as their immune issues and so let's just kind of go through this
with a hypo okay not enough thyroid hormones and we're talking primarily about hashimoto's
it occurs eight times more in women now with a hyper graves um you also see almost eight it's
like 7.5 times more common women between the ages of 40 and 60. okay so that's the first
clue another clue is that one of the triggers for a hypo hashimoto's is that a woman who gives birth
in three to eight months postpartum past their their birth has higher incidence of hashimoto's
so what does that tell us right there estrogen is involved and we already know that estrogen blocks
the conversion from t4 to t3 now if we switch over to graves there's a seven times higher
risk of developing this condition a year following your delivery again involving estrogen so estrogen
apparently is a big trigger when you get a a total t4 and a total t3 measured on your blood test
that is not the best test you should get a free t4 and a free t3 test you're going to have more
accurate data now when we talk about tsh thyroid stimulating hormone okay which by the way that
is not a thyroid hormone it's a pituitary hormone your pituitary makes a lot of different hormones
and that's one of them it controls the thyroid from above from somewhere in your brain a lot of
doctors will use the normal value of 0.4 to 5 as being normal but there's some more credible data
that states that that normal value for thyroid stimulating hormone should be 0.45
to 2.5 okay not all the way up to 5. that would be a more of a normal range that i
would focus on so if it's above that then there's a problem and also realize that the higher the
tsh goes now the next point i want to bring up is the relationship between t4 and t3 t4 is a pre
thyroid hormone and then t3 is the active thyroid hormone so it has to be converted and there's a
huge problem with a lot of people with the conversion and so you need certain things to
help you convert which we'll get into in a second but if you have a thyroid problem and you're on
synthroid you're taking t4 realize you're taking the inactive version your body has to convert it
and what you may not realize is that 20 percent of t3 is produced directly from your thyroid gland
and the rest is the t4 so if you're given t4 only and not t3 you could be a bit shy on getting the
full benefit of the thyroid hormones thus the reason why you still have these symptoms and the
other reason why you may have still have symptoms and you're on synthroid is just simply because
they're treating a secondary problem or you have a problem with the conversions so what would you do
if you have a hype o hashimoto situation here's some ideas i would recommend taking selenium
zinc both of these help the conversion from t4 to t3 they're also very powerful antioxidants
and the inflammation that's generated from these autoimmune conditions block the conversion these
cytokines block this conversion so this these two will help reduce that inflammation and help
the convergence now vitamin d is just a given vitamin d helps autoimmune conditions in general
and it's going to lower the inflammation seek help would be beneficial not just with the iodine but
it also has selenium and zinc and a lot of the other trace minerals and then purify bile salts
bile salts help convert t4 to t3 and so they will increase more thyroid hormone production
and if you have a liver problem a fatty liver a gallbladder problem thickened bile you're going to
be deficient in bile salts and that could be the reason why you're not converting thyroid hormones
now let's shift over to graves vitamin d is essential i would recommend if you're going to
take vitamin d for any autoimmune issue it should be minimally fifteen thousand IUs twenty thousand
IUs up to forty thousand IUs or even more and the next thing i'm gonna recommend is vitamin b1
why because b1 can lower your estrogen dominance if you have a hyperthyroid condition one of the
things that happens is you use a lot of b1 and so you're usually going to be very deficient
and you're also going to be deficient vitamin d but you're going to be really deficient in b1
and if you're deficient in b1 you can have a lot of the symptoms that will mimic a lot of other
conditions so you want to take bottom b1 in fact i would probably take it with the hypo as well
but for hyper cases like graves you don't want to take purify bile salts because
that's going to give you more thyroid hormones it's going to help you convert more
you already have too much so you don't want to take that all right so that's all i wanted to
communicate about the thyroid in this video thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

all right this is an interesting topic how important is organic when you're doing
keto so first of all what is organic well it means that you're not using synthetic fertilizers
pesticides antibiotics certain food additives you're not irradiating your food you're not using
sewage sludge and i'm not kidding they use sewage sludge in certain animal feeds and if you're doing
organic you're not using genetically modified seeds now you also have livestock that's organic
that means you're using feeds that are not using pesticides certain fertilizers certain antibiotics
etc etc and there's different levels of organic you have 100% certified organic you have just
organic so these foods might be like 80 percent organic or 50% organic or 98% organic there are
different levels of organic now if something's organic doesn't mean they're not using some type
of pesticide but that pesticide typically is less toxic so maybe they're using a detergent
instead of a pesticide maybe they're using lime sulfur or hydrogen peroxide all right so now let's
just take a look at several things number one the benefits of keto just because something is organic
doesn't make it keto just because something's keto doesn't make it organic it's apples and oranges
two completely different things keto is all about low carb it's about lowering your insulin
it's about getting your body to run on ketones there are huge benefits of doing just keto
regardless of whether you're doing organic or not of course there's always an ideal situation
right you have all organic food you grow your food in your garden or you get your food from
a farmer's market that way you have the healthy version of keto which is high quality ingredients
which means nutrient dense and none of the bad stuff then we come down the scale all the way
down to fast food right but it can also be dirty keto okay so you're still maintaining
that low carb but the ingredients are pretty crappy well that's better than not doing keto
okay and i even think it's it's better than doing organic ingredients but high carb i really do
so if you have a choice between fast food keto and organic food but high carb i would actually
do the fast food keto because the benefits of low carb are so huge and then we have a few things in
between we have conventional factory farming foods uh farm-raised fish then we have grain-fed animal
products and that's probably a step up a little bit above fast food if you're going to do keto
but that also depends on your ingredients a lot of the fast foods out there are very high in
soy oil corn oil canola and so that adds a layer of highly inflammatory food and then we step it up
to organic keto foods right from the grocery store and that's becoming more popular but there's also
the factor of where are they growing these ingredients let's say they're growing this food
this organic food on empty soils and so there's very low nutrients in the plant there's a huge
difference between buying organic food at the grocery store versus growing it yourself and
that's why i put this scale here we have different levels of health i just wanted to kind of
graph this so you can see the different levels because we also have the wild caught fish
the grass-fed beef which is different than organic and realize there's huge benefits in just doing
keto but there's additional benefits if you can take it up a notch and add the organic in there
the wild caught foods the grass fed and even going to the farmers market or growing food in your own
garden thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

can the consumption of diet sodas lead to a fatty liver well yes it sure can and this is fascinating
i'll put the link down below of the study that i just read aspartame it's an artificial sweetener
if you're consuming a lot of it several things can happen okay so the byproduct of consuming
aspartame is phenylalanine aspartic acid and methanol turns in the formaldehyde okay so
both methanol and formaldehyde depletes your glutathione this is like the major antioxidant
of your body okay major it protects the brain it protects the liver it helps you in detoxification
very very important and so this depletion of glutathione happens in your liver your red
blood cells and your brain so here are a few things that can happen you can start getting
an increase in liver enzymes like alt and ast that's not good that indicates liver damage
as well as muscle damage also you can get hyperglycemia that's high blood sugar
and that leads to diabetes you can get liver lesions liver necrosis
liver inflammation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease other than that you'll be perfectly fine
and i'm being very sarcastic but there are over 6,000 different foods with aspartame i mean you
would think that an artificial sweetener wouldn't do that but apparently it's it's acting just as
bad as sugar and on top of that it can really alter your microbiome or the friendly bacteria
in your gut which can lead to a whole series of additional problems so if you are consuming diet
sodas i would go to something like stevia sweeten sodas because they won't have the side effects
and they won't harm your liver hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate

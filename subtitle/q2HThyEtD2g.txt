all right i'm back for another short video i'm going to answer a question someone had
why do i feel worse on apple cider vinegar now the feeling worse could be stomach pain
nauseous or whatever so there's two main reasons why you don't feel good on apple cider vinegar
number one it could be that you have an ulcer number two it could be that you have gastritis
which is inflammation of the stomach lining the good thing is that both of those conditions can
be improved and they both require the exact same protocols so number one zinc carnosine
is key 50 milligrams three times a day spread it out doesn't have to be with food number two
chlorophyll i always recommend wheat grass juice powder because the chlorophyll in wheatgrass juice
powder is an excellent thing for the inner lining of the skin to the entire digestive tract it's
also good for your sinuses as well number three out of all the vegetables cabbage is the best
vegetable for an ulcer as well as gastritis and you can do this with adding cabbage to your salad
coleslaw and sometimes sauerkraut but cabbage is the absolute best thing for an ulcer
and especially gastritis it seems to be digested very well now the next remedy is called dgl
licorice it can significantly improve the symptoms of gastritis and an ulcer and the last thing and
don't forget this a very good probiotic especially if you have gastritis it seems to work very very
well and i've gotten really good results from that now there's another complication to this
problem that i want to bring up if you have gastritis an ulcer and you have sibo
that complicates things it makes things a little bit difficult because sibo small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth occurs when you have good bacteria in the wrong place the small intestine
so it's competing for nutrients it's creating bloating and the last thing you want to do is
add probiotics or fiber as in cabbage so you can't do that you have to do more carnivore
now one of the real good things to get rid of sibo is to take an acidifier
like apple cider vinegar or retain hydrochloride but you can't do that if you have gastritis or
an ulcer so you're really going to have to do a bit of a carnivore for a while
and you're just going to do fasting because fasting is going to be very very important to
allow the digestive system to reset it's probably going to be the thing that's going to help you
the most and i just want to bring up one more thing as you reduce the symptoms from gastritis
and ulcer which sometimes takes a while make sure you get unhealthy keto in imminent fasting to
prevent it from coming back again but the majority of people have huge benefits from apple cider
vinegar it has massive benefits for your blood sugars specifically helping insulin resistance
now despite virtually zero research and studies an apple cider vinegar helping your digestion
i've been using it for 29 years and i can tell you right now it really helps people with digestion
if they have low stomach acid if they don't have enough enzymes if they don't have enough bile to
digest apple cider vinegar is one of the best things to help reduce bloating indigestion so
we know it helps digestion the best time to take it is before a meal but a lot of people take it in
the morning and at night so you can pretty much take it any time i would recommend at least one
tablespoon in a glass of water if you're going to mix it as far as the ratio goes
now you can also do it in a powder or a tablet and i would recommend between four and five tablets
which should be equivalent to about one tablespoon and you can also add betaine hydrochloride which
will also give you some additional help as well thanks for watching before you go if you have
a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

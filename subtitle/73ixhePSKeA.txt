today we're going to talk about the best vitamin E and no I do not have any
products to sell you with vitamin E you're gonna have to research and find
the best vitamin E complex for you I want to focus on the type of vitamin E
the vitamin E complex and in nature of vitamin E always comes in a complex is
composed of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols and when I mention the
word for I'm talking about the four different forms
Alpha Beta Delta Gamma the type of vitamin E that most people need more of
are these right here tocotrienols they usually do not need the two cough
roles you can very easily get this from the diet this one is more difficult to
get from the diet however let me just explain more what these are specifically
first of all they're different than the tocopherols in that they are 5000 times
faster at handling free radicals vitamin E in general is a lipid antioxidant it's
a very powerful one and one of the main function is the protection of lipids so
where do you have lipids in your body the cell membrane do you realize that
you have 38 trillion cell membranes in your body that need protection in fact
every cell has a double lipid layer and 90% of the thousands of antioxidants in
the cell are vitamin E without vitamin E all sorts of things could happen to the
cell membranes the free radical damage and oxidation can damage the cell wall
itself and put a hole through it and allow things to go in there yes it's
important to have any oxidants for your DNA and all the different structures
inside the cell but the lipid membrane is one of the most important things to
prevent anything from going into the cell so you can look at toke
trials as these little antioxidants that are spinning extremely fast like 50
times faster than the tocopherols to clean up and neutralize all this free
radical damage depending on your past health and your current health and what
condition you have and how much stress you're under and how much inflammation
you have and how many oxidants you're being exposed to if you're smoker
all these factors contribute to the importance of vitamin E complex vitamin
E especially the tocotrienols are anti-cancer cardioprotective they'll
give you a liver protection I just did a video on this and how they can keep
inflammation down to prevent cirrhosis and even the fatty liver they support
the cell membranes of the skin the brain the joints the nervous system especially
the inside of the arteries to prevent the formation of a thrombus or a clot
where do you get tocotrienols you can get it from rice which I don't recommend
you can get it from palm oil or you can get it from annatto okay I believe this
is one of the best sources simply because it's composed of mostly the
tocotrienols and not the tocopherols there's been
some research that the tocopherols can compete for the tocotrienols and limit
the function of these right here well in summary if you're gonna get a vitamin E
make sure you get the whole complex including both these and these or you
could just get these from your diet and get a product that's made from this and
that way you can get the very important benefits from this part of the vitamin E

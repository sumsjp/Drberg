so i'm going to talk about why you should probably add more mushrooms to your diet okay
there's several reasons first of all is a mushroom a vegetable no it's not it's a fungus okay it's a
fungi and fungus and mushrooms are very very keto friendly let's break it down we've got 92 water
okay in mushrooms four percent carbs two percent protein and less than one percent fat
so in one cup of mushrooms we only have two grams of carb and one gram of fiber so really we only
have one gram of net carb so again mushrooms are extremely uh keto friendly but it's not just the
low carbs that we're interested in they have a lot of other things very rich in the b vitamins
especially b2 b3 b5 folate very high in selenium which is a powerful antioxidant that is vital for
your thyroid and a precursor for glutathione for the liver which is the most powerful antioxidant
also loaded with zinc which i've done a million videos on that great copper source okay copper is
part of the vitamin c complex which is important in making collagen and also in your immune system
and it has a good amount of potassium also if that mushroom is exposed to uv light there'll
be some vitamin d in a in a form that's like a pre-vitamin d that has to be converted but
there's some vitamin d in that mushroom but i think the biggest benefit of mushrooms
go way beyond just the nutrients it goes into the antioxidants the chemicals in these mushrooms are
incredible i mean it has beta glucans which are anti-tumor there's many many different chemicals
in mushrooms that give some very cool effects to support your adrenals for stress to support
vitality to support your immune system to help you reduce inflammation and the list goes on and on
funguses have been around for a very long time even before plants and funguses are more related
to animals than they are to plants fungus even has the ability to break down plastic in our
environment not in years but even by weeks so they have adapted to many different harsh environments
in their survival and have created different compounds that can benefit us as well and on
the spectrum you have mushrooms that are poisonous that can kill you yet you have mushrooms that can
heal you and are used for medicine and there's a couple other very interesting things about
fungus number one you probably heard of good friendly bacteria it's called the microbiome
or probiotics or flora well you actually have friendly fungus you have friendly yeasts which
are a type of fungus that greatly benefits your immune system helps you make vitamins
helps make nutrients more soluble to be absorbed in the soil we also have a tremendous amount of
fungus that's not researched as much as bacteria but fungus and bacteria work together
to take the rocks in the soil to take the clay to take the sand and to break it down
into certain minerals that the plant can then uptake and in exchange the roots of that plant
give off certain things like even sugars and other types of carbohydrates and amino acids
to the fungus and the bacteria so they can work back and forth and so it's a very
interesting topic especially for someone that's creating a garden and wants to make sure that
plant is very very rich in nutrients you really need the fungus not just the bacteria so those
are just a few reasons why mushrooms are very uh not just keto friendly but extremely
healthy for you hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

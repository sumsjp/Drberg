hi guys in this video we're going to talk about how to lose the cellulite
okay the stuff that's on the side of your hip and your butt the stuff that
you hate let's just talk about what is this thing cellulite first normally you
have the skin you have this outer connective kind of like a sheath of
connective tissue it's called fossa right underneath the skin that keeps
everything held together it's like saran wrap and then you have a fat layer okay
these little fat cells underneath and then you have the muscle so you have
these layers what happens in satellite is you have an enlargement of the fat
cells the fat cells get bigger they fill up with fat then you can over stretch
fascia so this spiderweb thing is supposed to
hold it starts to separate in the fat kind of bulges up through it giving this
dimple effect okay then behind it you have atrophied muscle which makes the
whole thing kind of jiggly and hang off the body so with the combination of
atrophied muscle fat cell enlargement and broken-down fascia that's what's
happening so now let's talk about how to reverse this thing because there are
things that you can do like if you had a pregnancy and you basically gained a lot
of weight and then lost a lot of weight and then you wanted to diet and gain a
lot of weight and lost on the way you're eventually gonna get cellulite because
you're just you're you're creating in this this this over stretching of your
fossa and that can do it as well but typically what happens during menopause
is these hormone shift you're maybe more inactive and everything just starts
going downhill so number one we want to shrink the fat cell we need to get the
fat out when you lose weight when you lose fat you're not getting rid of the
fat cell okay you're just shrinking them you can't get rid of your fat cell
you're just making them smaller so to do that you have to deal with the main
hormone that controls how much fat goes in there and that's insulin you have to
lower insulin you cannot fix cellulite without lowering insulin first okay how
do you lower insulin I'll put a link down below but typically you're gonna
have to change the eating plan you have to cut out the carbs are gonna have to
do fasting so I listed exactly what you
need to do you need to watch that video that will decrease this fat for sure
okay because because this is bigger this fat is also producing inflammation too
so it's probably very very sore in your hips and thighs as well but once you
reduce that the soreness will go away so we want to lower insulin number two we
want to tighten up this fascia this fascia is controlled by hormones specifically
growth hormone growth hormone is the anti-aging hormone that is involved with
all proteins in the body not just the hair skin nails but the facha around
your hips your buttocks and around that fat if you try to lose weight unhealthy
you never fix the growth hormone factor and you end up never getting rid of the
site light so we want this is all this is about really getting the liver
healthy it's about triggering growth home as much as you can it's not about
taking hormones it's about you have to do some type of exercise you have to
there's no way around it you have to physically move those muscles in there
to activate it but the best is a combination of a little higher intense
full-body exercise specifically you know in the hips and thighs but then lots of
rest the key is recovery and sleep so we want to increase the sleep increase the
high intensity lots of rest make sure you don't over train and then you can
get these this fashion back and the muscle as well moderate amount of
protein you want to consume high quality amino acids I like eggs egg yolk don't
do low fat protein powders you want to add more fat if you do a protein powder
add fat to it intermittent fasting vital because intermittent fasting triggers
growth hormone if you're doing five six meals a day spread out or snacks you're
never going to increase growth hormone and then the third thing is cortisol
cortisol is very destructive on the muscles so more cortisol from stress
will just prevent everything from working
it keeps the insulin high it keeps growth from wound down so we really want
to handle with this this you may want to support the adrenals directly if you
need to have because the jury knows control cortisol but typically what you
to do is you have to cut the stress out increase the sleep very vital and then
also vitamin D I get get son if you can more son it would be better and a lot of
walking walking will also lower cortisol so the combination and the days off that
you don't do the high-intensity go for a walk very important and then the last
thing is estrogen estrogen if you ever notice more women get cellulite than men
because of the estrogen component estrogen makes fat unfortunately
estrogen puts the fat around the hips so what how do you lower estrogen you you
want to consume cruciferous vegetables you want to get your liver really really
healthy very very important to do that but the last thing I want to mention is
that this condition is not a little thing
it's a major problem that's been there chronically for it takes so many years
for this to end up like this so just realize it's gonna take some time to get
this back it could take one to two to three years before you start getting
your your tissues back to where they should don't think it's gonna happen in
a week and give up just think long term because to rebuild this stuff at if you
especially if you're menopausal it's just gonna have time but you're gonna
see changes over time so and you'll see improvements and definitely do it before
and after pictures so you can visualize that so you're not looking yourself in
the mirror every second and not seeing the it changes as fast alright go ahead

someone had a question about what you do
if you have an arrhythmia
after you break a fast with a meal so
let's talk about that
so an arrhythmia is an abnormal
heartbeat it could be a palpitation
it could be a skip beat and of course
what i'm going to tell you is my opinion
and
check with your doctor before taking any
of my advice
okay but this symptom could occur
especially if you're
not doing keto but you're just doing
fasting so let's say you're doing a long
fast over 48 hours
and you do this big carbohydrate meal
you may notice some body problems simply
because
you're going to spike insulin and
insulin moves the electrolytes
from the blood inside the cell so we get
a shift
of all these electrolytes potassium
magnesium
sodium chlorides and phosphorus
and when we have the shift we end up
with a deficiency in the blood
of these electrolytes and you can have
heart issues you can feel dizzy
especially
if when you're doing the fast you're not
taking any electrolytes
these electrolytes aren't usually stored
in the body very well
except for sodium tends to be stored but
not potassium magnesium
and these other electrolytes so here you
are doing this long fast
and you're kind of deficient in the
electrolytes and as soon as you take a
high carb meal
it can create this shift of even a
greater deficiency in electrolytes and
that's when you start noticing
uh problems now there's a medical term
for a longer version of this where
you're
basically starving or you're not eating
for a long period of time
and then you eat too fast and it's
called the refeeding
syndrome but that's a little bit
different because you're actually
starving
and then you eat too much food and this
is actually dangerous this is why they
always tell you to eat
a little bit of food and gradually eat
more over time but this problem can
happen
if you're doing fasting 48 or 72 hours
or obviously even longer so number one
you want to stay on keto and don't do a
high carb meal
okay number two
you want to take electrolytes while
you're fasting
and that way you won't be deficient and
also
realize the longer you fast the
smaller your meal should be when you
break the fast
so you want to break the fast with a
kind of a real small meal
a keto friendly meal and then wait a
little bit and have a little bit more
food
weigh a little bit more and have even
more food and the reason for that
is we just don't want a sudden shift of
these electrolytes
inside the cell as well as being put
into
stored sugar as glycogen as well so you
want to keep your electrolytes in the
blood at a certain level
and not have that drop all right thanks

so if you have hpv you may want to use dim now what the heck is dim and what is hpv
human papillomavirus then we have dim which is this really long word that describes a compound
in cruciferous vegetables okay now the question is why do they use this dim and what does it actually
do well certain phytonutrients are very unstable so it's really hard to put them in a supplement
and so this actually then converts into this right here which is much more stable and you can
dehydrate it and you can use it in a supplement it's really good for people that have estrogen
dominant issues okay so i've done all the videos on it but today i'm going to talk about what it
can do for human papillomavirus now i don't know if you know this or not but 80 percent of sexually
active adults have been exposed to this virus so this is a lot more common than you might think
in fact hpv is the most common std sexually transmitted disease and it is the cause of
cervical dysplasia which is abnormal cells of the cervix it can trigger breast cancer
genital warts and cancer of the throat the mouth and the tonsils so what's interesting about this
is you have the national cancer institute is doing some hardcore research on dem
treating hpv with seems to be some really good results now you're probably wondering
where do you get these ideas dr berg for these videos well actually this came from a patent
okay i spent a lot of time studying patents because they have a lot of great
summarized data right there on various remedies and they have all the research there so it can
help to kind of consolidate everything in one document so i can actually get interesting
relationships and connections with various remedies so apparently someone is doing a
patent on using this for that but they're not just including these positive effects they're
also including some interesting research that shows a potential improvement for other types of
herpes infections like the ones that create cold sores and shingles so if you have a cold sore or
you get shingles you may want to try this as a remedy so anyway i wanted to create this video
on another reason why cruciferous vegetables can help you with things that go well beyond just
detoxification of your liver they can help to dismantle the effects of certain viruses and
lower your risk of getting cancer and warts and and other issues all right thanks for watching so

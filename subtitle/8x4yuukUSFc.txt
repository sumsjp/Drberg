so i am a poster child for right-sided shoulder and neck pain i had this problem for over a
decade and had no clue what it was i've done videos on it but a lot of people new to my
channel have not seen those other videos so i wanted to do another video for anyone who has
right-sided tightness or pain okay either in the head the neck the shoulder or in your back on the
right side between your scapula and your spine okay it's called the rhomboid on the right side
if that's tight if it's painful or this right trap is tight or painful this video is for you now i
know some people are going to say well i have it on the left side i will cover that so we have this
thing called the liver which is on the right side hint and you have all these little uh tubes that
drain through the liver that form these little ducts they're called bile ducts because your
liver generates bile and it all just flows down and it goes right into the gallbladder where it
concentrates right and then when you need it when you eat the gallbladder contracts and
it goes into the small intestine and it helps you break down fats okay with the help of the pancreas
the pancreas then will release lipase which is an enzyme to break down the fat and take it to
even a smaller level so then the intestine can absorb it so there's several different places
where this process can break down number one if you have a fatty liver or you have a liver that's
uh cirrhosis is scar tissue because then you can't have things flow that well and things get kind
of backed up you can also have a bile that's very very thick like sludge okay that just doesn't flow
so the concentration of bile is not there to break down the cholesterol so we have we're
very heavy on the cholesterol very low in the bile and it turns into a sludge and it backs up
when it backs up the bile goes up in the liver and it starts to irritate the liver because bile is
like a detergent and then that irritation creates inflammation and it will definitely cause pain on
your right rhomboid area or right trap now what if there's a problem the gallbladder or the ducts a
little bit lower well that can create a backup and congestion underneath the right rib cage
and you have a little nerve there called the phrenic nerve and that nerve goes all the way up
actually on both sides but if it's if you have compression on one side
it's going to pinch and create a constriction on the right side through here and even cause
that vertebrae to twist because there's a spasm in that area so you keep going the chiropractor
you adjust it but it keeps popping out because the gallbladder is continually irritated and it
can even cause pinching of a nerve that goes down your right arm too so anything on the right side
think gallbladder even headaches on the right temple if the duct in the pancreas
which by the way joins the bile duct right close to the small intestine if there's some blockage
you can actually get a backup into the pancreatic area okay that's when you're going to feel the
pain on the left side okay it could be anywhere on the left side so if you have this discomfort
on the left side think more pancreas but it's still the same problem it's either a sludge
in these bile ducts or it's a stone and by the way it's very very hard sometimes to detect this even
on an mri because sometimes the sludge just does not show up there's no big stone and it's really
hard to detect uh this very thick bile the best thing and least expensive thing to do is just
to take some purified bile salts and then that will start to loosen things up and it'll start
draining and you'll feel better then you really know that there's a connection now what causes
these problems the biggest thing is unsaturated fatty acids as in omega-6 fatty acids corn oil
canola soy cotton seed okay those oils it's in dressings it's in condiments it's
in a tremendous amount of foods right especially if you go out to dinner you're going to be getting
some of these oils and then that's going to go into the body it's going to create a lot
of inflammation in your liver in fact the reason why i'm writing all these things down is because
i will experience pain right here if i actually consume any of these items actually at least one
through four all right so number one it's too many omega-6 fatty acids number two too many
nuts why because nuts are heavy in omega-6 fatty acids right they also have other things as well
like oxalates and other things that can irritate the bile ducts number three chemicals in the food
i'll give an example sometimes when i'm traveling i can't seem to get organic coffee so if i'm
consuming some coffee that's not organic it's usually going to have chemicals pesticides and man
will i feel it underneath my right rib cage and i will get this little thing right through here
okay so i don't drink a lot of it before refined carbs will definitely irritate this area
okay and five if you're new to keto a lot of times people will do heavy amounts of mct oil
they might do a lot of keto bombs and the liver is not ready to handle all these fats
so then they start getting bloating underneath the right rib cage and pain right here simple solution
cut down on the excess fats don't start adding coconut oil or mct oil you're not ready for that
let your body adapt to this higher fat diet and in the meantime you can even take some purified
bile salts to help with the digestion of these fats the other thing to do is to start increasing
omega-3 fatty acids like the salmon sardines cod liver oil very healthy cut down the nuts
do organic do the healthy version of keto if you're new to my channel i put a link
down below increase the amount of vegetables because vegetables don't irritate this bile duct
they actually help the flow of bile through these little tiny tubes and most importantly doing
fasting doing regular intermittent fasting and doing periodic prolonged fasting because if you're
fasting you let the liver and the gallbladder and the bile ducts and the entire digestive
system finally heal and rest so it can rejuvenate all right if you want more information i put some
links down below for more data on this topic hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

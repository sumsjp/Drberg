so let's talk about cereal as a kid I consumed probably more cereal than
anyone that I knew I would go to the grocery store with my mother and go
there just to pick out my own cereal to get the little prizes in the cereal and
I had zero awareness what was in that cereal but that continued all the way
until college in fact I was consuming cereal all through college had no
awareness that it wasn't a really good thing to do now the worst time to feed
someone cereal is when they're an infant infant rice cereal which is very popular
has inorganic arsenic in it okay now in the soils where they grow grains and
plants there's always going to be some arsenic in very very small amounts and
it's called organic arsenic and our bodies can deal with it very easily so
it's not really a problem but inorganic arsenic is different that usually comes
from some type of pollution from some waterway that's fed into where that rice
is growing in other plants so this is not healthy for an infant in fact I
found this very interesting study I'm going to put down below that talks about
the exposure to cereal to infants increasing the risk of autoimmune
diseases and I'm talking about type 1 diabetes get a problem when you feed
this cereal to a babies they don't have the enzymes yet to digest that cereal
I'm talking about amylase that's developed months later so you're giving
this food that they can't digest with this heavy metal not to mention the
tremendous amount of sugar rice cereal is screaming high on the glycemic index
it's way up there it's gonna turn into sugar and that alone can set your child
up for all sorts of blood sugar issues down the road of course the other thing
that you know about already is cereal has massive amounts of added sugar I
mean in some of the cereals one cup is equivalent to the sugar of on twinkie
so when you look on the boxes of the cereal it may say it's heart healthy
because it has whole grains the problem is that the whole grains have feit taped
ok phytate is a chemical in grains that will block the absorption of zinc in
other minerals and zinc is vital in the growth of that child now we have the
gluten in the wheat products and many kids have an allergy to gluten tears up
their colon they start developing inflammatory conditions early on that
then lead to allergies and a lot of gut problems down the road when you buy
children cereals they have about 40% more sugar than adult cereals I'm not
saying that adult cereals are much better
most cereals have at the very minimum at least 2 plus teaspoons of sugar per
serving and that's added on top of the grains which also turn into sugar and
then we have the problem of the GMOs okay so these grains whether it's wheat
soy corn other grains even beet sugars have been exposed to glyphosate and this
is the herbicide in the GMOs creating problems with their immune system then
we have the fortification of that cereal you'll see that it's fortified like
fortification is like a really good thing right well they give synthetic
vitamin a they have zinc niacin and iron but these vitamins and minerals are not
the type of vitamins and minerals that you would see in in plants and they have
a different effect on the body to the point where they can accumulate and
cause more of a problem what should your child consume I put some links right
here to cover that topic thanks for watching

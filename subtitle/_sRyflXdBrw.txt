now you can tell a lot about the body by
the ph of your saliva and your urine and
you can get very inexpensively these
little ph strips right here i don't know
if you can see that right there oh back
here okay there you go
so basically what you do
is on the front here you see you have
the different phs
and you just like strip that off and you
put your mouth
and then you can match your ph to
whatever it should be okay same thing
with the urine now what you need to know
is this ph goes on a scale
from 1 to 14. right in the middle is 7
that's neutral
so anything above 7 is more alkaline
than anything below seven is more
acid
and the other thing you need to know is
that when you're talking about body ph
you're talking about a lot of different
phs and so when someone says oh yeah
everyone needs to be more alkaline you
have to ask them what part of your body
you're talking about they're probably
talking about the blood okay they're not
talking about the stomach so each tissue
in your body has a different ph and so
the reason why i like measuring the
urine in the saliva is that it's very
easy you don't have to withdraw blood
you just need to get one of these which
is only like six dollars or maybe 10
bucks and then you can check these
things periodically to see what's going
on the other point i want to bring up is
that this only gives you one little
indicator or
clue about what's going on with your
body there's a lot of other pieces of
information you're going to align to
that to see if you really have this
thing so just because your saliva or
urine is too acid or too alkaline
doesn't really give you the full picture
or a really accurate diagnosis but it
can give you a clue of what's going on
inside all right so the first thing
we're going to start with is the urine
ph okay so normally the ph of urine
should be slightly acid it should be
between 4.8 okay
to 7.8
however
i would say an average around five to
six but it can go a little bit higher
okay so what is urine urine is filtered
blood okay and your kidneys do a great
job of recycling everything it can it's
very very efficient so it's going to
take proteins it's going to take
vitamins it's going to take
minerals etc and and conserve them and
pull them back in the body but if you
can just see what the ph of your urine
is you can get some pretty cool
information about what's going on inside
so if your urine is too
alkaline okay let's say it's an eight or
a nine it could be because you're
drinking too much alkaline water some
people have bought this machine to
alkalize their water and i've seen
people with a urine ph of a nine
by just drinking too much of this water
so that's like way way out of range it
could be because you test yourself right
after you ate okay and that can also
throw off the page so you don't wanna
check yourself right after you ate it's
best to do it
uh like two hours before you eat however
if you're doing it right when you wake
up
chances are your ph is going to be
really really really acid so you really
don't want to assess this as the first
catch the urine catch of the day so
don't just check this right after a meal
check it like before a meal now if it's
too alkaline it could mean that you're a
vegan and you pretty much eat a lot of
alkaline foods being too alkaline could
also mean that you have an infection
okay a bacterial infection because this
bacteria gives a byproduct of
excessive ammonia which is very very
alkaline but just realize that because
you're too alkaline it doesn't mean you
have an infection i'm just listing all
the potential things that can contribute
to excessive alkalinity now
relationship to this condition called
gout if the ph of your urine is too
alkaline and you have gout
you have an increased risk of releasing
these uric acid crystals into your big
toe
so you'd want to acidify your body to
reduce the crystals so you really can
only have a gout attack if your urine ph
is too
alkaline all right next thing that can
make your urine two alkaline is if
you're on a diuretic
or if you are taking antacids or it
could be that you just vomited that can
make your
ph change and when we talk about kidney
stones for example
kidney stones tend to develop
when you have alkaline urine
so if you keep your
ph of your urine more acidic and you
drink enough fluid it
majorly decreases the risk of getting a
kidney stone because when your fluids
are too alkaline
calcium doesn't tend to
mobilize it tends to come out of
solution and forms crystals i mean you
may have seen this in your house if you
have well water for example or hard
water and you see these little calcium
crystals
depositing on your faucet
that means that the water is alkaline
and that calcium is coming out of the
water and accumulating on your faucet
now one more thing about having
excessively alkaline urine that also
exists when someone has kidney failure
all right now let's shift gears what
happens if your urine ph is too
acid now remember i'm talking about
above the normal ph range of what uh
urine should be so if it's too acid it
could mean that you're consuming
too much
meat okay
it can also mean that you have
uncontrolled diabetes and that's because
you might actually develop a condition
called
ketoacidosis
because ketones are acid now typically
when you're on a ketogenic diet you're
not going to see a major
excessive acid in the urine but if you
are on the ketogenic diet plus you're
doing fasting especially prolonged
fasting
you're probably going to see a very
acidic urine and that usually is nothing
to worry about
that's normal but some people might be
concerned
and if you are concerned you can just
consume a little bit of baking soda just
a little bit just to help neutralize
that but i wouldn't necessarily be
concerned about that because you're
going to eventually eat and then the ph
is going to come back to normal
so fasting
or even starvation
can increase the acidity of your urine
now you also see dehydration when you
have an overly acidic
urine situation
and lastly
if you check the first urine catch of
the day you're going to see
it being very very acid so i wouldn't
worry about that but i'm just letting
you know that it's going to be
excessively acid if you check your urine
because all night long you are fasting
all right so now you have a little more
awareness on
how to evaluate the ph of your urine
okay now let's switch gears to the
saliva
now normally the saliva should be
not as acidic as a urine it should be
just slightly acidic
or neutral okay so the normal range of
saliva is between 6.2
okay
and
7.6
now one purpose of saliva
is to help
flush out
the carbohydrates in your mouth
and the acids
that contribute to feeding bacteria
okay
because the bacteria in your mouth
love and live on
sugar and other carbohydrates
so the saliva that is constantly being
produced is washing it out
to limit the amount of food
for your microbes it's also eliminating
some of the acids that are a byproduct
of bacteria because when the bacteria
and yeast ferment
sugar and carbohydrates they produce
like lactic acid and other acids that
can then cause
decay so that's one purpose and the
other purpose is to help buffer the
acids because in this lava you actually
have
alkalizers that help buffer the acid
there's also a lot of other things in
saliva you have enzymes to help break
down carbohydrates and i also will put
another video down below talking a
little bit more about saliva if you're
interested all right so if you take this
right here and you check the ph
of your saliva
and it's too alkaline okay that means
the ph is going too high
that could mean you have too much
bacteria in your mouth and when the ph
is excessively alkaline in your mouth
you are at risk for getting tartar
and tartar is more of a advanced
dental plaque situation it's crystals
building up because you have number one
bacteria and number two your ph is
alkaline so remember when i talked about
calcium
um kind of coming out of solution when
you're too alkaline same thing applies
here so you're getting calcium deposits
on your teeth you get calcium deposits
in your kidney as kidney stones
and you can get calcium deposits in your
joints as arthritis or calcium deposits
in your heart
as plaquing so calcium deposits have a
lot to do with
ph
and by the way if your blood is
excessively alkaline uh you might have a
tendency to get tetany that's like a
little twitching twitching or a muscle
cramps whereas if your blood is too acid
that is going to affect your energy
level you're going to be tired and it's
also going to affect your breathing
however i don't want to get into the
blood ph because that is very very
difficult to test all right so let's get
back on topic and by the way
the bacteria
use this calcium
to
protect themselves
against
extremes in ph so if your urine is too
alkaline
that bacteria can still survive
so bacteria doesn't like extremes it
will live in a certain ph but it tries
to survive by doing things to protect
itself all right so the next thing that
occurs with an excessively alkaline
saliva is gingivitis so gingivitis is a
mild form of periodontitis which is
inflammation around your gums and so if
you have tartar that's accumulating in
your teeth that is just underneath the
gums that's going to create inflammation
but a mild form of inflammation in your
gums it's called gingivitis so now what
about
if the ph of your mouth is too acidic
what does that give us some information
about well it could tell us that you're
eating way too much sugar
because bacteria
also can thrive
when the ph of your mouth is too acidic
and you're feeding your bacteria sugar
so if you're doing a lot of
carbohydrates or you're
i don't know chewing a lot of sugary gum
or you're chewing candy that's sticky or
you drink
sodas or you drink a lot of juice
all that sugar is going to feed the
bacteria and then the byproduct from
that is going to be a lot of acids
and then all that acid is then going to
cause
demineralization the calcium from your
teeth is going to leech out
and that is what we call a cavity so if
you have kids for example
you should be using this to check their
ph and educate them about what that
means
you can just tell them like wow your ph
is too acid because you're feeding your
bacteria in your mouth all this sugar
and that's going to lead to
a cavity so that might motivate them to
stop eating sugar now if your ph is too
acid you might have
chronic halitosis because of the
bacterial connection they produce
excessive certain gases and you might
have more of a severe
infection in your gums
that's called periodontitis so
with
excessive alkalinity and excessive
acidity in your saliva
you can have bacteria all right so now
the big question what do you do to
correct the extremes in phs whether
something is too alkaline or too acid
now there are a lot of videos i've done
on maybe taking apple cider vinegar or
eating certain things to bring the ph
back
but ultimately that the best thing you
can do
is just to focus on eating healthily
okay and what does that mean
well for that information i'm going to
send you to another video but by eating
correctly
that is going to be your best bet to
correct
the different ph's that occur at the
different places in your body versus
doing other things to try to like patch
up this problem
so for what to eat
this is the video that you need to watch
next

so let's talk about motivation and weight loss there's a lot of people that just don't have the
motivation to get started to lose weight now i've done a survey on this i found some interesting
information so i want to share with you the number one reason why people want to lose weight
is they want to look better in their clothes shocking right number two they want to be around
for their grandkids so they want to extend their lives number three they want to feel healthier
number four they want to reduce their risk for getting a health problem so it could be they
want to avoid getting diabetes or cancer or some other health problem number five
they want to be able to get it from a seated position or when they're kneeling on the ground
because when they get up they're so heavy that the knees are bothering them okay number six they want
to reduce their medications so all these answers are the survey results of about 2 000 people
and i did this a few years ago but these are the main reasons why people want to
lose weight now there's many things that stop a person they have bad habits they like snacking
they like sweets they like carbohydrates i've done a million videos on these topics but i want
to tell you um two stories real quick on two patients which is actually quite fascinating
because when i was in clinic i had the opportunity to talk to a lot of people and i was specializing
weight loss so i had a lot of people come in that were grossly overweight and i'll never forget
this one lady came in and she was literally over 350 pounds and i was always curious why
she didn't start a lot earlier why is she starting right now at what point did she decide
that's it i'm ready to start what motivated her she was walking down the street and she looked
down and she saw a shadow of someone that was very very large and then she realized that was herself
so i said wow that's incredible so didn't you at the time look at yourself couldn't you see
yourself in the mirror she goes no i never looked at myself i had no idea i was this big
and that was interesting because after that i would ask people that question and there's
quite a few people who had this were in the same situation they weren't really aware of their own
body and how much weight they have gained until one day they they see a shadow of themselves or
a reflection in the mirror and they're like what the heck happened so that's what motivated her
so before i get to the next story i want to tell you the absolute best motivator to help you lose
weight okay it's pretty expensive go to the store and buy a full length mirror and hang it up in
your bathroom and every single day while you're naked look at yourself front and center to the
side and to the back if you do that every day i promise you you will have the motivation to start
a weight loss program all right second story this lady came in very much overweight and she started
talking about her history of being overweight and at one time she had a very nice body and she was
very attractive but here's the thing she didn't like all the attention she got you know she had
walked on the street and people would whistle at her and she hated that and that's when she decided
to gain weight why to avoid getting attention become grossly overweight problem solved right
well that solution became a problem as she got older because she started getting high
blood pressure she's a diabetic right now and so that was her motivation to come see me but it was
interesting to find out the original reason is just avoiding attention so i said to her
what's going to happen now that you lose weight and you start looking better and you start getting
attention is that going to be a problem she goes no i'm actively and aggressively looking for
someone i want a relationship i've been lonely my entire life and i'm ready for a relationship
i said great okay so let's let's get started all right the next point i want to bring up is
when someone starts a weight loss program a lot of times they'll start with the exercise before
the diet so what's more important the exercise or the diet well exercise only gives you 15 of
the results with weight loss diet is 85 percent i would highly recommend starting with the diet
first then start the exercise if you can do both that would be great but if you just start with the
exercise without the diet you're going to be frustrated you're not going to see the results
and it's going to be hard to continue because the diet is so important with weight loss but let's
say for example you have a hard time with the diet you just can't change your diet at this time but
you want to lose weight what do you do you do intermittent fasting one meal a day even though
you're not doing keto doing intermittent fasting will be better than nothing and it will help you
and a lot of people will lose weight then over time you can gradually phase into healthy keto
and intermittent fasting all right there's your tips thanks for watching hey before you go real

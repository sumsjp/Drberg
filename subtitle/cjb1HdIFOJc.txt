how does someone really know if information on health weight loss or whatever is trusted credible
and reliable that's the topic of today now of course most people go online they do a search
and usually whatever is first they pick that as the most credible or reliable information and
so that's what i did i actually went online and i typed in the best way to lose weight
and then what i did is i ordered their booklet and so what we're going to do today is we're going to
go through it and i'm not going to mention who it is whatever i'm just going to kind of go through
it and i want to evaluate it from two viewpoints one from my viewpoint and two from a consumer's
viewpoint what you're going to find out there is so much information and data in this booklet and
really no emphasis on the most important things versus all the other stuff that may not matter
what is the most important thing to know about this do i have to read the entire article an
entire book and then do everything or do i just focus on one thing or two things that is a big
issue so what makes something credible is that the number of studies that are backing it up the
problem with studies is most people don't read them they're relying on second-hand information
and also there's a ton of manipulation and bias in the area of research what about testimonials
i like testimonials especially if they're video or picture because that doesn't lie i think even
though it's anecdotal i think they're credible also reviews they can be faked but if i see a
comparison with two different products and one has a lot more views i'll have a tendency to buy that
product over this product over here and before i get into it i want to share with you a very
interesting observation that i made just being in practice for 30 years whatever is touted as
the most reliable information the most credible the most trustworthy information especially if
it's in the area of mainstream i usually look in the exact opposite direction i have found through
experience that it ends up not being the most reliable information and what happens if someone
has a fixed idea and knows everything about it it's almost impossible to teach them anything
because they won't look at the information they already have their mind made up so when
you evaluate something you have to look at the information yourself you have to ask yourself does
it make sense you have to differentiate is it fact from opinion so let's go through this this booklet
i read the whole thing and the first thing we're talking about there is no secret that
two and three american adults way too much the question is why as it turns out there isn't
one simple answer darn it i was looking for that simple answer it starts with a combination
of genes and environment we live in today okay so right there talking about genetics okay and
a little bit later they they said that scientists have found 127 different genes related to obesity
but that's pretty much it so now the point is okay what can you do if you have a genetic weakness
there's not much you can do so right there if it's genetics and i'm a consumer reading this
i'm like oh i guess i just have bad genes and there's nothing i can do about it right and so
then they talk about stubborn hormones they talk about leptin okay which has to do with appetite
and then they get into consuming high calorie foods and too little exercise okay i mean
we've heard that a million times right we know that going on a low calorie diet this does not
work so then they get into the power of genetic influences could be up to 40 of your bmi which
you know what that's just opinion that's not a fact i totally actually disagree with that
but if i was a consumer i'm like oh geez i might have to go check my genetics there that could be
why i'm not losing weight so any diet that i do and it doesn't work i can just blame it on my
genes right all right next part here we're talking about calories and portion control
having again it's like eating less calories
it says right here in in one study researchers offered volunteers four different serving sizes of
macaroni and cheese okay when served the largest portion the volunteers polished off 30 percent
more food than when given the smallest portion they didn't report feeling any more full than
when they ate the smaller size now let me just say something about this right here this information
is just very confusing because what they're omitting is the fact that if you eat any carbs
at all especially macaroni and cheese you're going to stimulate insulin and insulin is going to cause
hunger so as far as portion size whether you have a big bowl of macaroni and cheese or a little
bowl it's still going to make you hungry and this gives us no good advice or information and
then here on this page it talks about metabolic syndrome okay that's like when you have high blood
pressure high cholesterol you're pre-diabetic and you have visceral fat right here but
nowhere in there do they talk about what causes that high levels of insulin so you're omitting
that piece of data they're talking about you should lose weight to improve your metabolic
syndrome just like right here lose weight keep it off and maintain a healthier weight my whole thing
is let's get healthy first so you can lose weight but that's not their motto all right next page we
have some tips brown bag it at least three times a week add two healthy foods to your shopping list
rethink your drink all right these are all tips that are pretty low on the list of importance
all right next page it says avoid ultra high calorie foods and they're talking about fats right
saturated fats well we know fats are necessary to be able to satisfy you so if you're going low fat
lean which we'll get to in a little bit you're just going to be
actually more hungry because there's nothing there to satisfy you especially if you're doing
snacks okay this next part they're talking about strict calorie counting isn't the best strategy
okay well that's good and then we get over here it says beating hungry with a high quality diet
so there's a quote here it says eating processed carbohydrates raises insulin levels and insulin
drives calories into fat cells for storage well thank you right here is the most important
sentence of the entire book but there's no other mention of this okay so they're actually telling
us that you know process carbohydrates gonna raise insulin and you're gonna store fat but the next
part of the page it's it's giving you all these carbohydrates you should be eating
it says right here good carbohydrates although processed carbohydrates can lead to weight gain
not all carbohydrates are bad in fact carbohydrate heavy foods such as peas beans lentils fruits
vegetables and whole grains can be a healthy part of your weight loss well not if you're
the average person in america not if you have insulin resistance not if you are over the age
of 40. you have to stop the q-tip when there's resistance here's the thing even when i wrote my
first book i recommended consuming fruits this is probably i don't know maybe 10 years ago and
i was eating apples every day those apples were keeping me overweight i think i weighed 211 pounds
i'm 180 now and all i did is remove the apples i mean so an apple has like 19 grams of sugar
and then they're recommending whole grains not a good idea all right next page here we get into
consuming fiber foods again more grains one of the easiest ways
to sneak more fiber into your diet is to increase the intake of whole grains what about vegetables
they don't mention that people who on a regular basis consume whole grains tend to have lower
bmi and less body fat than those who don't eat whole grains i would love to see that study and
i'm not talking about a questionnaire study i'm talking about an actual study i will guarantee
there is no study other than a questionnaire over five years aim for at least three servings every
day for more ideas of boosting your fiber see page 10 okay and the recommending fruits right
here okay then we get into lean proteins okay you should always have lean proteins skinless chicken
breasts etc etc like the fats gonna really make you fat no no when you have lean protein
you actually immediately increase the food's relationship to insulin you increase more insulin
there's a scale called the insulin index and the leaner the protein the higher it is on that scale
so the fattier the protein the lower the insulin response so an insulin index is those
non-carbohydrate foods that trigger insulin compared to the glycemic index which is
just carbs all right so here we have another one another sentence here i like this they go
some research even hence this type of fat may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes we're
talking about saturated fats i like that they don't tell you what research and all they say
is it hints so it doesn't actually come out and say it so it might influence it
so that's just a way of saying they don't really know okay what's more in late 2015
an international panel of experts convened by the world health organization concluded that
processed meats raised the risk of colon cancer instead stick with a healthier low saturated fat
options such as chicken fish eggs tofu beans and lentils wait a second no no what if you're doing
grass-fed beef that's high in saturated fat isn't that okay so that's not the type of processed
foods that they're studied there actually is no study that i know about that's actually evaluating
grass-fed beef or organic beef it's mainly processed meats with nitrates and other
chemicals all right next part talking about power up your morning with you guessed it breakfast is
the perfect way to start your day on the right track here's why breakfast can supply lots of
foods and nutrients that are linked to less hunger well wait a second you just went to bed last night
and you didn't eat the whole night you're in this fast and then you wake up many people aren't
even hungry and then you're going to eat you're breaking the fast so guess what if you were just
to keep going you would actually not be hungry maybe until noon so i just disagree with that
okay so we have breakfast doesn't have to be a major meal work some extra fiber into your day by
grabbing a couple of slices of whole wheat toast or a whole grain english muffin or if you have a
few extra minutes pour yourself a bowl of whole grain cereal boy they're really pushing these
grains aren't they so it's more carbs more carbs what's going to happen is about an hour and a half
you're going to be hungry why because of insulin and this is what is missing in this publication
someone without the knowledge that insulin is like the most important thing is going to read this
and just be totally confused and say well yeah i already tried that 20 years ago it didn't work and
maybe it's my genes right all right next part says the art of snacking okay it says that you may have
heard that eating lots of small meals or snacks is the best way to curb your appetite the truth
is this advice has been greatly exaggerated now on the second part of the page it's telling you
when choosing snacks simply follow the same guidelines prioritize whole foods with minimal
processing and look for healthier sources of fat carbs and protein so they're they're saying that
you know maybe snacking is not a good idea but then they're telling you
to snack here's a good one it says hide snack foods if you keep your salty or sugary snacks
on the kitchen counter find them a new home tucked away in the pantry if they're not in your line of
vision every time you enter the kitchen you'll be less tempted to eat them that is not true
i know people that will search out these carbohydrates every night looking for these snacks
it's not a big deal to go into the pantry and grab them why even buy these snacks in the first place
don't buy them keep them out of the house or on on page 29 you can just if this doesn't
work you can try cognitive behavior therapy okay so they give you that option they also
give you an option of gastric bypass so here's the problem you have this document
that gives you a lot of information with some true information some false information
but they don't tell you what is the most important information and that is this right here base the
whole diet on keeping your insulin low and you will be successful all right talk to you later

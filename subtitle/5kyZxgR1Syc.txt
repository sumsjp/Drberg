hey guys dr. Berg here I had another question regarding ketosis and sugar alcohols sweeteners
okay now this is a list of mostly sugar alcohols alternative sugar type sweeteners now there are
some other sweeteners that are not sugar alcohols but so let's just kind of go through them at the
top of the list this is the highest glycemic index that's bad as we go down it's good okay so
we don't want it very high because glycemic index basically is a scale of how fast things turn into
sugar and raise blood sugar maltodextrin is the highest and this is why a lot of the electrolyte
powders have maltodextrin a lot of vitamins have it you want to stay away from that stuff it
has 110 glucose that's 100 sucrose that's table sugar okay so that's 65 high fructose corn syrup
58 but even though you might say this is lower this can create insulin resistance very fast
because it messes with your liver honey is 50 if you were going to do honey I would recommend the
two below honey versus other types of honey then we have multi tall which is 35 xylitol which is
12 this is the one that I use simply because it it doesn't have an aftertaste I get the non-gmo
yes it's definitely not zero it's very minor but if you have in small quantities I have not
found to be an issue but you may want to avoid it sorbitol which is 9 mannitol 2 of the erythritol
is one this is a really good one the problem with erythritol with some people
is it gives them bloating and gas so you might want to try and see if it's okay with you but
make sure that you don't consume very much monk fruit is zero this is a really good one then we
have studio also I didn't put a list of that zero as well so that just kind of gives you a relative
system of values of really bad and really good thanks for watching hey you probably already
subscribed but if you haven't press this little button down below and I will keep you updated

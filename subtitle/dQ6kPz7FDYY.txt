hey it's me again in this video we're going to continue with the amazing gallbladder
part 2 now in part 1 we talked about the function of the gallbladder
which basically is to help release bile to help break down fats okay and bile B I L E
is a good thing it's not waste it's a good thing to help extract nutrients
from the food that you're eating now if there's a lack of bile or if there's
congestion in the gallbladder because of a lack of bile yes you can get pain
around your midsection over the gallbladder but you can also get something
called referred pain now what does that mean well there's a nerve that goes from
the top of the gallbladder on the diaphragm there all the way up to the
right side into your neck and that's called the phrenic nerve so it's a
hidden referred pain because a lot of times you think you have pain in the
right shoulder here but really it's coming from down here so the typical
pain that will happen is right on the right upper shoulder right through here
and there's a muscle right here and it attaches to this bone right here called
the scapula into the neck and so this little muscle called the levator anguli
scapula muscle that muscle gets really tight and ropey and a lot of people
massage that thing all the time but it never releases because the problem is in
the gallbladder and so when you step on a dog's tail he barks through his what
mouth very good that's my analogy so what happens is that you'll get pain
right through here it can refer up into the neck it can go into the right side of
the jaw and cause headaches it can go on the shoulder itself and go right around
this scapula right through in here but anything right here is all gallbladder
and liver because it's backing up through this liberal amount of space so
it can put pressure on that area if that happens and the person sleeps on their
left side because this liver is a little bit enlarged it can compress the heart a
little bit and you'll feel uncomfortable so the best way to sleep with this
problem is on the right side and on the left side now when this nerve
gets aggravated and it pinches like the third bone right here that's where it
goes to it can cause a little rotation of those vertebra and and the need to go
to a chiropractor over and over and over and over again so the pinched that nerve
it can even cause pain all the way down the right side and so I'll see people
that come in with splints on the finger and pain on the hand or the wrist or the
arm and they think the problem is in the hand if there's no injury I already know
it's something right here so a little bit of let's turn this around here if
you were to press on the gallbladder very gently and if you notice relief
right here then we know it's the digestive system it's the gallbladder so
what do we do do we take the gallbladder out no okay no we actually start eating
healthy so the best food for the the gallbladder would be a healthy diet like
a lot of greens a lot of vegetable some fat you don't want to have no fat low fat
because that that's going to be a problem because you need some fat to
release it so but a lot of salads and vegetables and things like that that's
what you eat right yeah okay good so I just wanted to explain in part two this
concept of referred pain and how common this condition is yet very few people
know about it so I'm increasing your awareness on the gallbladder so I will
see you in the third part

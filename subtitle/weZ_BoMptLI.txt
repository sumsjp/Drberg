hey guys today we're going to talk about a very unconventional uncommon counterintuitive
fatty liver cleansing tip okay before I get into the tip I just want to
give you some basics about the liver the liver is about three and a half pounds
it sits over on the right side right about here it has 500 different
functions here's the problem when someone develops a fatty liver there is
virtually no symptoms at all now you start to develop a gut but it's very
rare to have symptoms until it starts becoming more advanced and then
eventually the person starts getting fatigued weak nausea abdominal pain
right shoulder pain pain in the upper right trap maybe some headaches on the
right side pain in the right rhomboid back here but what happens is you have
this fatty liver and then eventually after years of inflammation you get
cirrhosis and this is scar tissue now builds up in the liver and in this
process you basically lose function of the liver you lose the ability to
detoxify okay so you build up toxic waste you also build up excessive
amounts of cortisol because the liver is the organ to help buffer and regulate
excessive amounts of cortisol that's the stress hormone this is one of the causes
to a an adrenal fatigue problem also you start building up excessive amounts of
estrogen this can manifest as many different things one man boobs a woman
that's estrogen dominant you can have cancer so a functional liver is really
important in the detoxification and regulation of these two hormones right
here the other problem is when you have less function of the liver you get less
bile production and if you're not producing a bile
you can't break down toxic waste you can't break down fats you can't actually
absorb vitamin A D e K omega-3 fatty acids and the list goes on and on and on
now there's two different categories of a fatty liver one would be caused from
drinking too much alcohol the other one is not the other one is a non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease you can develop that from eating very poorly and the big
thing that causes a fatty liver would be fructose in the form of
high-fructose corn syrup it's in the sodas it's in the food in
fact fructose is 20 times more likely to cause of fatty liver than any other
sugars and as far as the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 25 percent of the
population actually has this but not just overweight people not just people
with a gut skinny people are twice as likely to die from a fatty liver then
overweight people probably because they're skinny and they think they're
healthy and they can eat whatever they want so they do eat whatever they want
now this next point was quite interesting there's actually many
studies on this but here's what happens when mice are fed methionine and choline
deficient diets they get a fatty liver but they don't gain weight they don't
get insulin resistance or diabetes they just get a fatty liver the thine eyne is
an amino acid in choline is an essential nutrient in the B vitamin family and the
thine eyne is a precursor a building block to the most powerful antioxidant
in the body which is called glutathione which is a software-based compound that
helps you break down chemicals and choline is a called a lipid trophic
nutrient it actually dissolves fat in the body and it can actually strip off
fat from your liver so now let's get into the counterintuitive tip I'm going
to talk about typically when you think about liver cleansing or getting rid of
a liver problem you're thinking of juicing a vegetable cleanse consuming
low fats consuming lower amounts meats things like that however when you do
that you only get a certain amount of results because check this out the foods
that are loaded with choline are egg yolks
liver grass-fed dairy and cruciferous vegetable okay math I'm you have beef
chicken pork nuts fish eggs so two of the most important nutrients in
correcting or reversing a fatty liver involve foods
higher in fat and protein so if you want to cleanse and heal a fetid liver you
don't want to go low-fat you don't want to keep your protein too low moderate
protein not excessive but you don't want to start cutting out all these foods
right here so instead of doing juicing or only vegetables you should do a
combination of the cruciferous vegetables and fattier proteins
including egg yolks and fish of course make sure they're grass-fed now there's
two goals with detoxifying a fatty liver one is to get rid of the toxins of
course because the liver has a function of detoxification so the cruciferous
vegetables are loaded with the phytonutrients to help create this
effect and by the way certain animal products organ meats fish seafood also
have antioxidants to help remove toxins from your liver it's not just vegetables
so we want to actually do something to get rid of the toxins as well as get rid
of the fat and to do this you must lower your carbs and this is why healthy keto
the healthy version of keto is necessary and that basically means the concept of
low carb with a lot of vegetables so that would be essential and then of
course in a minute fasting why because of intermittent fasting forces your body
to use up your glycogen Reserve and to run off fat so it kind of creates a
vacuum to pull the fat out of the body and that's what's needed to start to
deplete the fat in the liver I also suggest that you take choline as a
supplement you can get methionine from the protein and you can also get choline
but if you take some extra choline I recommend about 4 to 500 milligrams
you can even go as high as 3,000 milligrams if you want but typically I
always start out about 300 to 400 milligrams of choline you can get in a
tablet or get into powder and start consuming that what that will do it will
start to dissolve the fat and the liver and speed up the process so of course we
want to add the crisps I would recommend steaming or slightly
cooking these because that will release more vital nutrients eggs are essential
for the choline quality protein of course don't get this at 7-eleven go to
the health of store and increase the quality and the last point I want to
bring up which is really important is if you try to cleanse the liver especially
if it's a fatty liver with a low fat diet you will not have enough bile to
help detoxify it one of the functions of bio is detoxification so bile is not
just about absorbing fats on the vitamins it is about making sure the
liver can purge some of the toxic wastes and what triggers bile higher amounts of
saturated fats this is why you want to keep consuming egg yolks maybe even
organ meats and moderate amounts of protein to make sure you release the
bile and you don't become deficient in methionine or choline alright guys well

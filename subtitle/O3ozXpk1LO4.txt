so this video is relating to starting keto
and then all of a sudden you get itchy skin okay
that is bile salts it's backing up from the liver back into the
skin because you have something called
cholestasis cholestasis is when you have a decreased
flow of bile either because there's an obstruction in
one of the ducts that's backing things up
or there's just some sludge going on and when i'm talking about sludge i'm
talking about you have a higher level of cholesterol versus the
bile the ratio of cholesterol is too high
to the amount of bile that you have and what happens over time is that's what
turns into a gallstone so a gallstone is really a lack of bile
the key is having enough bile to keep the cholesterol emulsified and broken up
so that doesn't develop but in the process it can form the
sludge and back things up to the liver and bile is a detergent
and it can be very toxic if it's in the wrong place
especially the skin you can have itchiness
in this situation you may also notice a full sensation underneath the right rib
cage just kind of really stiff down there and
this all started because you introduced more fat to the diet and
you just didn't have enough bile to handle the fat because your body
hasn't adapted yet it will over time so you might want to
reduce some of the fat but when you start to introduce a lot of
fat and you don't have enough bile there to handle that this
can happen as a side effect the solution is very simple you just
take some purified bile salts this is what i would
recommend taking you can get it from the health food store or online
TUDCA t-u-d-c-a it's a type of bile salt
that can help this taking an empty stomach
three times a day i'd start off taking one per day on an empty stomach next day
take two third day take three i would also get some choline choline
will help as well what's going to happen when you take
this it's going to unjam the clock it's going to open up the flows
of bile through the bile ducts and it's going to give you a lot of relief
and the itching is going to go away go ahead and try it and comment down below

so today we're going to talk about early detection of silent liver cirrhosis now
here's the problem with cirrhosis which is basically scar tissue of the liver
there is real no symptoms initially for decades until the later stages so you
don't really always know that you have cirrhosis however there is one symptom
that most people do experience and that would be feeling sluggish and tired but
that could be coming from a lot of different things you might not recognize
it so the two categories of cirrhosis are compensated cirrhosis where the
body's compensating so really there's no symptoms in this phase and then over
time you develop what's called decompensated cirrhosis where you start
experiencing all these other symptoms so these are some of the symptoms that you
experience when you have cirrhosis one is spider angioma which is something on
your skin you have this little red dot with these little red like spider webs
coming out from it xanthomas which are little cholesterol spots sometimes
you see them around the eyelids they're yellow because the liver is not
functioning correctly jaundice where your whites of your eyes
become yellow and also your skin starts to become yellow that's liver damage
theater skin because you can't make collagen anymore so you get this paper
like skin on the back of your hand and you can see it pretty much all over and
then you have something called ascites which is a fluid-filled sac around your
midsection it might look like it's a fat gut but it's really fluid that's leaking
out from the liver creating like a potbelly next one gynecomastia which is
basically breast tissue Club fingernails okay so they're like a little square
little clubbed shape edema in the lower leg you see this very very often with
liver damage and you press your finger in the lower calf or the lower part of
the leg and you lead a little dent okay that's edema swelling read palms
confusion bruising itchy skin itchy feet cognitive issues so your focus your
memory your concentration just isn't there so if you do research on cirrhosis
you see that people get a list for a liver transplant
they're put on maybe some supportive medication for other diseases
but they don't really tell you what to do to prevent it or they don't give you
advice to what to do naturally but there's a lot of confusion on this okay
that I want to sort out right now because they'll say that cirrhosis is
associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease is associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome and
obesity and so you just need to lose weight and manage your diabetes symptoms
but they don't really sort out cause and effect in what comes first second and
third well I'm just gonna explain right now very simply it all starts with
something called insulin resistance okay and that's created from alcohol or if
you're doing a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it can be created from junk food
a high carbohydrate diet sugar frequent eating drugs legally or illegally or
even a virus could actually trigger insulin resistance okay when you have
instant resistance you also have high levels of insulin okay then you're going
to get inflammation so this condition creates a lot of inflammation the
inflammation will also make the insulin resistance worse then comes the fatty
liver 65 million Americans have a fatty liver that's incredible that's a large
percentage so then after a fatty liver you get scar tissue that replaces the
normal liver cell and that's called cirrhosis so you get the scar tissue so
you have a combination of fatty liver and inflamed liver that then becomes
filled with scar tissue and you lose function so in summary insulin
resistance causes the liver to be fatty okay insulin resistance is basically
what causes diabetes okay and diabetes you're always gonna see insulin
resistance type 2 diabetes I'm talking about that's the trigger of it because
it goes from insulin resistance creates high insulin over a long period of time
then what happens you get a burnin effects where the pancreas can't keep up
and then the blood sugar starts going high that's called pre-diabetes
then it goes higher and then it's a full-blown diabetes type 2 metabolic
syndrome is basically high cholesterol blood sugar problems belly fat all
symptoms coming from insulin resistance they kind of put it in this syndrome
like it's a it's like a disease by itself when in fact it's just a bunch of
symptoms that are caused by this right here okay obesity it's caused by instant
resistance high levels of insulin and then cirrhosis is also caused by instant
resistance so this is really at the core of this right here so if you start
having some of these symptoms I'm gonna recommend that you start focusing on
this right here improve insulin resistance and then see if these don't
improve as well I put a link down below for more information on this and what
you need to do thanks for watching so I want to know about what you think about
this video so please comment below and tell me what you think

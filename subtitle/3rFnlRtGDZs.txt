all right today we're going to talk about the most important white blood
cell now this is my own viewpoint and I'm going to tell you why now there's
quite a few different white blood cells but the T regulatory cell I believe is
one of the most important ones another name for the T regulatory cell is the T
suppressor cell same thing and you'd probably see it as T reg T reg for
short and if you wanted to know the full name of it this is another name then you
can look for not that you would ever be interested but what's unique about this
white blood cell is that it pretty much does the opposite of what all the other
cells are doing it is suppressing the immune system it is producing
anti-inflammatory cytokines it keeps the balance okay it keeps the immune system
from overreacting it ends the immune infection it lowers
mucus pretty much almost all the other immune cells are producing more mucus
producing inflammation killing things this guy is all about chilling things
out so really it does two main things it suppresses the immune system and number
two which is very important it regulates self tolerance now what does that mean
that means it prevents your body from developing antibodies to itself
they're called Auto antibodies so it basically prevents autoimmune conditions
so to do that it has to identify the good guys from the bad guys
and it you can't get confused so without this cell you would develop antibodies
against your own tissue and have a lot of inflammation so if there's a problem
with the cell the person develops irritable bowel disease type 1 diabetes
which is an autoimmune Ms rheumatoid arthritis asthma and even the cytokine
storm which is the actual reason why certain people are dying of COVID-19
those people that have a very weakened immune system so apparently when you
have a weakened immune system the is the weakness right here and then the
other parts of the immune system are in hyperdrive they're doing massive
destruction creating a lot of collateral damage to the tissues in the body that's
very very interesting but then how can we strengthen this cell right here well
it just so happens there are several nutrients and things that are intimately
involved with this cell right here if you are vitamin A deficient this cell
will malfunction you won't have enough of T regulatory cells in your body and
it's interesting because vitamin A supports the mucous membranes in fact
that's where certain inflammatory reactions can occur - right below the
mucous lining there on the inner skin so vitamin A is a real key factor in
supporting the immune system and then we have vitamin D vitamin D by itself is
anti-inflammatory but if you're deficient in vitamin D these cells just
do not work correctly now the T stands for thymus because they're produced in
the thymus gland and they get their training in the thymus gland so anything
that goes on with the thymus gland that shrinks it or causes it to atrophy will
cause a problem with this cell right here and it just so happens that by Miss
atrophy occurs when you're deficient in zinc also if you have a lot of stress
and you activate cortisol for too long that can also shrink the thymus not to
mention as you age the thymus shrinks so that's the relationship between age and
your immune system you get more inflammation you're more at risk for the
cytokine storm then we have something called DHA this is an omega-3 fatty acid
if you're deficient in this these don't work that well probiotics now if you
think about it children that have had a lot of antibiotics early on really have
a problem with increased risk of asthma diabetes type 1 irritable bowel syndrome
a lot more inflammation allergies why because your friendly
bacteria are part of the immune system so one thing that's very very important
is to make sure you have enough of the right bacteria and then we have the
factor of gluten gluten has been known to interrupt the regulation of this
right here which makes sense because certain people develop antibodies to
gluten which creates an autoimmune problem called celiac which is an
inflammatory condition in the bowel so now we're dealing with autoimmunity
again now in the study that I'm using to validate this information which I'll put
a link down below they also had the ad in there a high-fat diet
weakens the t-reg cells so I had to look that one up because I found it hard to
believe and I found that the high-fat diet that they used with this rat study
was from bioserve okay there's a product F 3 - 8 - and if we take a look at
exactly what they ate and what the thigh fat diet was the carbohydrates were
35.7% a true keto diet is only 5% carbs so yes this is a high-fat diet but it
was also a high carb diet as well and the reason I say that is because the fat
was 36% almost the same as the carbohydrate so it was a high carb and
high fat diet which we know if you combine carbs the high fat diet you're
gonna create a massive problem with the body especially with the spike of
insulin which would then suppress the immune system you'd have a lot of
dysfunction and then if we go down to the ingredients lard casein maltodextrin
which is the worst sugar of all sucrose mineral mix vitamin mix and of course
these were synthetic methionine choline chloride so you can pretty much just
scratch off a high-fat diet because they really did not use a keto diet they just
use a combination of high fat with a bunch of other sugars which you would
never feed anyone in years these are the things right here
that you'd want to focus on to support one of the most important white blood
cells which is the T regulatory cells if you haven't seen my video on
strengthening the immune system I put it up right here check it out

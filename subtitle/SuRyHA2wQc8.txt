so the next stretch is going to be the
low back
a lot of people sit all day long they
sit on one side they cross their legs
they have all sorts of imbalances we're
going to show you how to stretch low
back so it feels really good first
stretch is a muscle in the back that
attaches to your hip bone and to your
low back and so what we're going to do
is we're going to use any book a
thickness of a like about this thick and
you're going to put it in the ground and
I'm going to I'll demonstrate first okay
you're going to take one foot and you're
going to step on it and you're going to
drop your pelvis down so go ahead and
face this way this way here yeah and
then you're going to drop your foot down
but keep your keep your knees straight
and so the pelvis is dropped down but
your body is straight now do you feel it
straining on the low back I mean we want
to stretch the low back okay good so
we're going to compare that motion to
the other side
and go down and you might want to grab
good do you feel that stretching it's
tighter okay so so this one this side is
tighter so let's go ahead and stretch
the good side
and you come down come up and really
stretch that down there good
you might even have to lean more to this
side when you come down yes
and all the motion is going to be in the
pelvis keep your knee locked
and we're stretching the lower back
good
good now go ahead and do the other side
this gives the low back a lot of relief
does it feel better yes good
so this stretch will help even up the
hips

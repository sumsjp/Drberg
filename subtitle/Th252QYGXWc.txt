so this question came up recently in my live show does fasting actually increase adrenaline
because a medical doctor says you shouldn't be doing fasting because it's going to raise
adrenaline and you're going to be all stressed out completely ridiculous now it is true
that the pre-adrenaline hormone or neurotransmitter because adrenaline
and noradrenaline are neurotransmitters they're not hormones but they act like hormones but it
has been shown that when you start fasting your noradrenaline does increase about 48
not 48 times 48 so it goes up a little bit but also your metabolic rate goes up your resting
metabolic rate goes up so fasting helps your metabolism but think about what's happening
you are not eating so your body is going to live on your fat you're going through the
state of ketosis you're living on fatty acids and ketones and in order to mobilize as fat
you have to stimulate the fat burning hormones and a neurotransmitter called adrenaline so
adrenaline is there to mobilize the fat and it is true that short-term fasting can elevate cortisol
which is a stress hormone but that's a normal process when you don't eat cortisol is one of
the hormones and it's called a glucocorticoid because it helps you metabolize glucose but
what it does is it helps mobilize stored sugar so this is not a abnormal thing it's
just a normal thing to help you maintain normal blood sugars when you're sleeping
so it's one of the hormones that's involved in preventing
hypoglycemia but long term cortisol decreases if you're doing fasting on a regular basis
the fasting will increase not the flutter fight sympathetic nervous system but it will increase
the parasympathetic nervous system and this is why people feel so calm and relaxed and stress free
so the next time someone tells you that it's going to increase your adrenaline and stress you out
just send them this video before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

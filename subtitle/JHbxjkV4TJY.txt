let's talk about the male version of pcos what is pcos it stands for polycystic ovarian syndrome
okay pcos is a condition in females where you have these follicle or cyst like
things growing on the ovary and there is an excess amount of androgens being produced
and these androgens create facial hair loss of hair on top of your head weight gain deeper voice
and a very stubborn metabolism now pcos is driven largely by chronically elevated insulin okay this
is called hyperinsulinemia okay too much insulin in your blood now what causes that too many carbs
this is why the ketogenic diet is essential for pcos but in a male if we're going to talk
about the the equivalent of pcos in a man we're going to get three symptoms one is androgenic
alopecia this is male pattern baldness okay number two erectile dysfunction
why because insulin destroys circulation in the vascular system and the last one is benign
prostatic hypertrophy your prostate is getting too big and that is because insulin is a growth
promoting factor it makes things get bigger so if you have any one of these and we'll call
them symptoms you know you have too much insulin and the most important test that doctors never
do is a fasting insulin test and there's another one called homa ir which measures
as a part of that fasting insulin so if you have male pattern baldness a rectal dysfunction or
an enlarged prostate definitely get the blood test homa ir or even a fasting insulin test
and in the meantime if you want to see some amazing improvements i would recommend doing the
healthy version of the ketogenic diet as well as intermittent fasting if you're new to my channel
i put a link down below of exactly how to do it hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

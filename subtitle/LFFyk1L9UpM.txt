all right if you have shoulder pain you need to try this simple stretch it's awesome you're going
to relieve your shoulder pain within seconds and this simple exercise is based on an amazing book
that i'm going to highly recommend you get and the book title is called shoulder pain the solution
and prevention fifth edition by a doctor by the name of john i think it's pronounced kirsch he's
an orthopedic surgeon and he wrote this book based on a real simple discovery that he made
that has to do with just simply stretching your arms overhead and hanging from a overhead bar and
he said in his book 95% of all shoulder surgeries are unnecessary and he said and i believe this
hanging is the most important exercise to restore the dynamics of the bone and ligaments that pinch
the rotator cuff muscles so when you're hanging you're taking this humerus which is the arm bone
and you're stretching in a way to affect the chromium which is the top part of your scapula
it creates the space between the articulating surfaces and helps to restore the normal anatomy
of the shoulder so try this just 10 minutes a day and this is what you do you get some type
of a bar that you can hang from and you're going to be hanging from 10 to 30 second intervals
with both hands with your palms facing forward not like this but like that and you might want
to start out not hanging your entire body weight because you might not be used to it
so maybe you stand on a chair and you're just stretching your arms down with some body weight
and then you gradually increase more and more resistance to the point where eventually you're
hanging your entire body away now when you're hanging you want to really make sure that your
shoulders are completely relaxed the only thing that should have tension is your grip strength
so you want to start out hanging for 10 seconds and then work up to 30 seconds
and then rest for a minute and then repeat and you do this for 10 minutes it's that simple and
it creates a huge improvement in your pain now in the book he's also going to talk about exercises
you're going to add to this later but if you want to see instant relief with shoulder pain
just do the hanging part all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video so

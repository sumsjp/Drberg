so I had this question come up that I wanted to answer will eating too little
damage my metabolism so let's say you're doing fasting or then when you eat
you're having a certain amount of calories and it's maybe you feel that
it's not enough is that going to slow your metabolism down and this person
also mentioned that they were told that small frequent meals will stoke the
metabolism you know it'll keep the flame going you need to eat every three hours
okay which is completely not true at all if you're doing a low calorie diet it
really depends on what's happening with insulin because what's behind a slow
metabolism or a stuck setpoint where you can lose weight but you can't seem to
get below a certain point as higher levels of insulin specifically what's
creating at is insulin resistance and that's created by years of consuming a
lot of refined carbohydrates or just eating too frequently if you have
insulin resistance you have higher amounts of insulin okay in the
background the doctor never checks it they're looking at the blood sugar so
it's not going to show up necessarily right off the bat but the high insulin
is the hormone that prevents your weight loss so if we want to fix the metabolism
we need to fix this right here we need to fix this right here and guess what
fasting corrects insulin resistance now does a low calorie diet correct insulin
resistance it depends what you eat are you doing carbs yes or no if you're
doing yes then this low calorie diet is going to not correct this it's going to
not fix your metabolism and then the other point too is your nutrients like
even when you're doing fasting when you eat a meal if it's nutrient dense then
you will not destroy the metabolism your metabolism is also about how many
nutrients you're getting are you doing a high nutrient dense meal or is it just
something called dirty keto where you're not really paying attention to nutrients
because sooner or later certain parts of your body are going to be deficient in
these nutrients and that's what's going to slow the metabolism down it's going
to slow the thigh right down now you could do
low calorie diet with supplying all the nutrients and not effective metabolism
but typically the way that a person destroys our metabolism is they just do
a series of diets usually low calorie or low fat whatever that are very high in
carb and low in nutrients if you do that repetitively you end up with a very slow
metabolism they might do low fat popcorn or fruit or low fat snacks and end up
with this right here and a really slow metabolic rate if you have a slow
metabolism this is what you need to know right here the way that you lower your
metabolism to correct this is number one fasting and number two keep your carbs
low and number three keep your nutrients high
alright thanks for watching

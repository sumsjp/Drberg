i want to talk about the top nutritional deficiencies in the elderly it's a big
problem there's even a condition called the tea and toast syndrome now that happens
over time when a diet degenerates into you know consuming a little bit of bread or crackers and
tea maybe some occasional canned meats so there's gonna be a lot of deficiencies with that
but it's an actual syndrome and then you have the nursing home which is
a bunch of cook foods a lot of sugar low quality foods and snacks that they make available which
is going to increase the insulin and etc etc and a lot of the elderly also is on synthetic
vitamins they're in a multivitamin and the first ingredient is calcium carbonate which is limestone
which is why the bottle is so heavy it's not it's not really high quality stuff
not to mention that the elderly is on a lot of medications which can deplete you of vitamins
especially if they're on diabetic medication especially if they're taking diuretics which can
deplete the electrolytes so we have that the other factor is the older you get the less stomach acid
you're going to have which means you're not going to be able to digest protein and you're not going
to be able to pull in the amino acids which you need to help repair and heal the body also you're
not going to be able to absorb b12 that well and that creates all sorts of problems with energy
anemia inflammatory conditions brain issues and also you can't absorb minerals that well so there
goes potassium calcium magnesium etc the older you get the less nutrients you can absorb and
this is especially true for probably one of the biggest nutrient deficiencies in the elderly which
is vitamin d this group is not out in the sun they're not probably doing healthy cod liver oil
so there's usually always a major vitamin d deficiency and this is going to affect their
immune system vitamin b1 is usually also deficient too as someone gets older and if you've watched
some of my other videos you know the importance of b1 if you haven't i put the links down below very
important of course the other b vitamins as well this is why nutritional yeast is so important so
i would recommend for your grandparents is to give them nutritional yeast i would give them vitamin
d i would put them on a mineral supplement and a trace mineral supplement so we have
low potassium as well which you need for energy and nerve and muscle activation
magnesium is going to be a low so it's probably why the blood pressure is
usually high in the elderly also sodium is going to be low that's called hyponatremia
and the worst thing you can do with someone that is low in sodium is to have them drink a
lot of water keep drinking more water thinking they're dehydrated when you're just diluting
this sodium and other electrolytes and then they start developing all sorts of issues with that
and then of course low trace minerals the most important i think is zinc which is part of
so many different chemical pathways in the body so i just wanted to create this video
if you have a grandparent or a parent that's getting older definitely include some of these
nutrients in their diet and if you can get them on keto and then do intermittent fasting
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

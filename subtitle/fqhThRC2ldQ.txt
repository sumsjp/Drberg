now i've done a lot of videos on the
importance of potassium
but
i have not focused as much on
sodium so in this video we're going to
talk about the importance of salt in
fact i'm going to give you seven warning
signs that you may be salt deficient and
of course the biggest way you get sodium
is with just salt so we're going to be
focusing on salt in this video
why would someone be deficient in salt
well they don't eat salty foods right
they're told they're salt sensitive or
they have high blood pressure so they
don't consume much salt
maybe they're going through a lot of
stress the more stress you go through
the more salt you actually need let's
say it's hot out right or you're
sweating you're going to lose salt now
some professional athletes that are
working out hardcore in the summer can
lose up to
six grams of sodium just in one hour
so when we're exercising sweating we can
lose a ton of sodium as well as chloride
right
there's some reports that show that we
lose even more chlorides than we do
sodium okay here's another one
high amounts of potassium let's say you
start taking a potassium electrolyte
powder and you just neglect to take
sodium or salt right well that's going
to throw you off because anytime you
look at salt or especially sodium you
want to look at it in a balanced state
okay not as an individual mineral
because when you increase the opposing
mineral that's usually connected with it
like potassium you can actually increase
it or decrease it depending on what you
do to potassium for example if someone
is salt sensitive what that really means
is they're low in potassium so here's
the problem if someone doesn't know that
they're going to start reducing their
sodium more and more and more and
generate all these side effects that i'm
going to talk about what they should do
instead is just beef up the other
mineral it's much better to have
sufficient amounts of both minerals but
in the right ratio but anytime we go up
with potassium we need more salt anytime
we go up with salt we need more
potassium
okay you started the ketogenic diet
ketones are like diuretics okay you're
going to lose a lot of water and when
you lose the water you're going to lose
your salt and you're going to lose your
potassium so you need both of these
things to be put back into the body now
what about fasting yeah well you're not
eating anything you're drinking a lot of
water
you shouldn't be drinking anything when
you're fasting but you should be
consuming sea salt for sure if you are
fasting simply because our bodies
require
as an essential nutrient sodium and
chloride or you're going to have these
symptoms which i'm getting to shortly
now if you drink coffee let's say you
drink four cups of coffee in a day
you'll lose a half a teaspoon of salt
because caffeine depletes sodium which
is interesting maybe you want to add a
little salt in your coffee
i've heard that that will actually
reduce some of the bitterness
okay drinking too much water i've done
videos just on this topic
if you haven't seen those
this would conflict with what you've
been taught that we need to drink a lot
of water
everyone knows this but the question is
what happens when we drink too much
water well guess what we're going to
flush out
the electrolytes especially sodium
chloride there's people that have even
died by drinking too much water it's
called hyponatremia
because you're diluting sodium so you
want to drink when you're thirsty and
there's no problem drinking a good
amount just make sure you also add the
sea salt with it
okay so these are the reasons why
someone's deficient
the key is balancing your salt instead
of just restricting your salt or adding
more salt make sure you add the opposing
mineral potassium if you're salt
sensitive add potassium what does uh
salt do well it regulates your fluids it
helps you make hydrochloric acid because
sodium chloride
makes hydrochloric acid okay so
if you're low in hcl let's say you have
heartburn or indigestion especially you
might need to beef up your salts
okay maintains ph okay the acid alkaline
levels it's involved in the sodium
potassium pump which is in every single
cell in the body and that is the
generator pump for energy
for the nerve muscle connection
okay
very important as well as just
generating energy
helps glucose absorption and lastly it
helps hydrate you an average person
needs between one and two teaspoons of
sea salt a day now that's a very rough
figure because this does not take in
consideration how much sweating or
exercise you do but this is definitely a
minimum right through in here okay the
symptom number one symptom is weakness
in your muscles if you're deficient in
salt you're just going to feel weak
lethargy you know you're going to lose
that get up and go
dizzy especially if you get up too fast
because usually your
blood pressure is too low so low blood
pressure means you need more sea salt
insomnia could be
low salt in your diet so if you have
insomnia you should try this tonight
just put a little bit of salt maybe an
eighth of a teaspoon in maybe a half a
glass of water mix it up good in about i
don't know an hour and a half before bed
slug it down see if you sleep better
headache okay that can be a sign that
you need more salt muscle cramps and you
have a low
tolerance
to heat so you're out in the heat you're
out in the sun and you just
you can't tolerate it right some people
have intolerance to cold but other
people have a low tolerance to heat that
means you just need some sea salt
now i want to show you this right here
this is interesting
of course you you already know this that
sea salt is better than table salt right
i don't need to go into that but what is
sea salt sea salt is concentrated sea
water
and
an average sea salt is between 98 to
99.8
sodium chloride
that only leaves you with point two
to two percent
of the minerals and the trace minerals
that are left okay but i wanna bring up
a chart
on a a product that i recommend that i
actually take i put it on my food that
is very different than regular sea salt
okay it's called baja gold sea salt and
i put a link down below and what's
unique about this sea salt
is it has 77.5
sodium chloride which leaves room for a
lot of other minerals and trace minerals
in fact it leaves 22.5 percent room for
all these other minerals so now look at
the other ones down below like true salt
is 99.9 cargill purified sea salt
untreated is 99.9 morton's natural sea
salt 99.9 but there's other ones that
are
lower in sodium chloride like the celtic
sea salt which is 81.5 percent okay
that's better and then you have jakinson
sea salt which is 85.3
so you can see this chart there's a lot
of sodium chloride in sea salt but check
this out look at calcium right baja gold
sea salt is
4490 parts per million compared to the
other ones like celtic sea salt is only
1500
parts per million and look at cargill
purified sea salt it's like only 30
parts per million now look at potassium
6 000 parts per million for the baja
then if we move down the celtic it's
only 957
so the baja gold is more than six times
the amount of potassium but look at
jacobson sea salt that's 438 parts per
million in malden sea salt which is only
181
parts per million and look at cargill
purified that's zero zero potassium and
then check out magnesium with the baja
gold that's thirteen thousand two
hundred parts per million so if you
compare it to everything else it's way
off the charts now the question is how
can they make salt
with less sodium chloride and more
minerals well what's interesting about
this salt is the location of where they
get it in a pristine part of the world
called the sea of cortez
and what's interesting about that is you
have the colorado
river delta that drains into
the sea of cortez so we have fresh water
draining into ocean water and that
dilutes the amount of sodium chloride so
you're getting all these minerals from
the mountains that are flushed into this
one spot where they then capture the
salt and let it dry naturally by the sun
they don't artificially dry it like a
lot of other companies and then you're
left with this very unique product it's
very interesting on your food it gives
it a completely new flavor i love the
flavor it just enhances the flavor of
food which is very different than the
sea salts which i also use as well but
some of these sea salts are just
overpowering with the sodium chloride so
anyway i just wanted to introduce you to
the baja gold sea salt and
make you aware
of the various
signs that can occur when you're low in
sodium chloride now on the flip side
potassium
that's the next video you should watch
and i put that video up right here check
it out

the absolute worst stress for your immune system is not exercise stress or work
stress relationship stress or money stress or even marriage stress or even covid stress
it's this type of stress right here losses divorce or loss of a loved one this is the greatest stress
that someone can go through and the closer you are with someone the worse the stress is
because it literally shocks your entire system the term to describe this is called bereavement
there's actually some interesting studies on this it's a period of sadness loneliness and grief
it significantly suppresses the white blood cells to the point where
you're very susceptible to getting an infection
when i was in practice i would always ask people when did you start experiencing an autoimmune
disease and literally nine out of 10 times it was after a loss now also chronic fatigue syndrome
could be a reactivation of a virus as well as weaken your immune system just to make you more
susceptible to getting a new virus so here are some things that are very very important
when talking about the immune system you want to spend the majority of your time strengthening
your immune system versus trying to kill something off so you want to make sure that your environment
is very very supportive and therapeutic if you're an environment that also reminds you
of a loved one that you lost that probably is not helping you you want to stop getting bad news or
even stop the news completely don't watch the news on tv it's usually negative you want to hang out
only with supportive friends and family members avoid everyone else
you want to stay in motion a lot of times when people have a loss of a loved one or whatever
they tend to be paralyzed they tend to stay in bed they don't get out much they stop moving big
mistake you want to stay in motion and try to be very active music is a great therapy keto and if
from a physical standpoint can greatly reduce body stress and also help put some of these viruses
in remission if that's the problem last one you want to just keep creating in your life you want
to keep things alive you want to keep doing things you want to do your hobbies versus being inactive
and doing less all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

let's talk about natural remedies for organ transplant now before you apply any of this
information check with your doctor i'm not telling you to come off your medication or replace your
medication with these natural remedies but there's a handful of people who came up to me in the past
and wanted to know what can they do in addition to their medications and with some people they're
taking this anti-rejection medication and with a lot of side effects and it's not working as well
as it should and so they wanted some additional things to take because here's the thing when you
have a liver transplant or a kidney transplant your own immune system is going to reject it
unless you are getting it from an identical twin and so we have this huge inflammatory situation
so your doctor is going to start putting you on drugs that suppress the immune system okay and
they have side effects increasing your risk of infection worsening your digestive system
so what can you do is there anything you can do to help possibly reduce the amount of these
medications as you're taking it of course under the supervision of your doctor okay so i wanted to
give you four things that potentially could help number one red sage it's been used traditionally
for chinese medicine for a very long time it's good for copd chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease it's good for your heart cardiovascular disease it's good as a remedy if you had a stroke
or even in the prevention of getting a stroke it's generally good just to increase circulation
but it has a very unique immunomodulation property in which it helps to regulate the immune system so
there's not this excessive amount of inflammation and there's been some interesting studies
on organ transplants and using this directly and i'll put those links down below all right number
two thunder duke vine or thunder god vine this has been shown to be effective in kidney transplants
on mice it's also good for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases the
third thing which is very very important is a lot of vitamin d and i'm talking about between
20 and 30,000 IUs of vitamin d every day because vitamin d is a very potent anti-inflammatory and
it acts like a steroid or cortisone without the side effects and prednisone is one of the common
things that someone takes as an immunosuppressive agent in the countering of this inflammation when
you have an organ transplant and a side note about vitamin d is if you're taking higher amounts of
vitamin d over a long period of time just make sure that you're not taking excessive calcium
uh make sure you're drinking enough water like between two to 2.5 liters of fluid per day just
to prevent any potential concentration of your urine in the development of a kidney stone not
that that's going to happen but this can help make sure it doesn't happen number four taking purified
bile salts on an empty stomach and you would take like maybe four of these per day why because
bile salts help you absorb vitamin d number one and number two they've been shown to help reduce
inflammation especially if someone has an autoimmune problem and what we're dealing with
when someone has an organ transplant is an inflammatory process so those are the four
things that i think would help someone do some research check it out and see if it can help you

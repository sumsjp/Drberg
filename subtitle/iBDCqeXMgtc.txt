so sometimes when people do keto they may develop adrenal fatigue
symptoms okay and I'm going to talk about why that is and what you need to
do to prevent that now when you start a keto plan you do lose a lot of water
simply because most people are on a high carb diet and high carbohydrate diets
cause you to retain fluid so you get on keto and you lose the fluid and you also
can lose less salts okay carbohydrates cause a retention of
sodium ketosis gets rid of excess amount of sodium and fluid so salt is also
needed to support healthy adrenal glands and if your adrenal glands are fatigued
guess what you will be losing more salt there is actually a condition called
Addison's disease where the adrenals are completely shot and you are basically
losing a tremendous amount of salt and you need to consume a lot of salt to
survive because it's very dangerous when you lose salt but the combination of
doing keto and having adrenal fatigue basically mean you need more salt and I
would recommend if you're gonna do salt you always do
sea salt and the best salt that I would recommend is the Himalayan pink sea salt
so why Himalayan pink salt because it's unrefined okay so recently I was at a
grocery store and I was reading some labels on things and I picked up a
little canister of salt okay and I read the this is table salt read the
ingredients was sodium chloride and some anti-caking agent as well as dextrose
they put sugar in the salt I showed Karen I'm like can you believe that
they're putting sugar in the salt now so when you get the salt you want something
more natural you want something that has the whole package and table salt is a
refined product so the Himalayan sea salt is unrefined it has 84 minerals
okay not just sodium chloride it's unpolluted it has most of the trace
minerals trace minerals are the cofactors to help enzymes work in your
body which are proteins that are involved in the machinery of building
tissue and helping you digest also sea salt is
antimicrobial it's very necessary to support healthy blood sugars it can also
prevent cramping when you're in keto so if you start keto and you start noticing
cramping it could be a deficiency in magnesium
it could be sodium but when you're doing the sea salt you're getting the whole
package of minerals not just sodium chloride but all the trace minerals and
other minerals so the two big symptoms that indicate that you need more sea
salt are keto fatigue and keto flu however you would also want to consume
it if you start developing low blood pressure fatigue in general or lightheadedness
and one last good indication is your salt cravings if you crave salt
add some more sea salt to your diet an average person needs about a teaspoon
of sea salt every single day and lastly I have another very interesting video on
salt check it out and thanks for watching

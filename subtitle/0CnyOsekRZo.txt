hey it's Dr Berg again in this video
we're going to talk about a product
called ovary support formula um
obviously this is made for females it's
one of my best products to support a
healthy ovary it does not have actual
hormones in it but it does have
nutrients to support the gland itself
whether the gland is doing whatever this
will provide the nutrition that's
missing to help it and support it um who
takes this uh women that want to support
their menstrual cycle uh postmenopausal
women that may have hot flashes take
this I recommend taking three before bed
if that's the case uh so anything that's
connected with the menstral cycle or
menopause this is the product that I
recommend

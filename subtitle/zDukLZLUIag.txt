let's talk about the best exercise for a condition called spondylolisthesis
and that condition is where you have this bone in your lower back that is overlapping in the other
bone it usually is like l5 that's overlapping the sacrum so what happened is you had this fracture
long ago or recently and that broke off the back part of your vertebra and now it's slipping
forward and so when the spinal cord comes down to the column it has to take a little bend and
sometimes that can create dull pain pain down the legs bowel problems a lot of issues there's
some great exercises that you can do to totally stabilize this area and prevent future problems
realize that the vertebrae is slipped forward okay floor this way so anything that would hyperextend
going backwards where your back is being arched backwards would be a bad thing so if you laid on
your stomach and arch back up you don't want to do that because that's going to push this vertebrae
further forward what you want to do is do the reverse of that so you want to lay on your back
that's called being supine okay and then you want to bring your knees up to your chest you can start
stretching them but then you can actually do exercises where you're bringing either one leg
at a time or both of them upwards back and forth to strengthen the lower part of your abdomen that
would be very very smart as far as an exercise this way it pushes that bone back into alignment
also if you were to lay the opposite direction prone over one of those big exercise balls and
you lay forward it's going to push that vertebra up into your back and you can kind of stretch
and then another really good thing to do is if you could lay on your back and push your lower back
to the ground okay so keep pushing that to the ground so you can start getting relief
because what we want to do is we want to take that vertebra and keep it aligned so
there's no pinching of the spinal column and doing planks is essential i'll put a link down
below of what that is but you're basically holding your entire body at a certain level
and you're just holding that position and it's called an isometric exercise and you can actually
lift your arm and your leg but that way you're not bending your lower back you're strengthening your
core and that really is the key and the core is really the connection between the upper torso and
your lower legs so anything that will stabilize your core would be a very therapeutic thing
and anything that would extend your spine going back would be very very bad a couple more points
reducing inflammation in general will greatly help so you of course want to do healthy keto if
you're new to my channel i put a link below what that means you definitely want to do intermittent
fasting because that's probably the most powerful thing to drop inflammation vitamin d3 is essential
i would take a minimum of 20,000 international units of vitamin d every single day and that will
actually help your back pain in fact your muscles will feel relaxed and if there's any arthritis
that will feel better as well stinging nettle root is another one of my favorite plants that
gives you an anti-inflammatory effect as well all right thanks for watching

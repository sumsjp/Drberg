hi guys in this video we're going to talk about kimchi and it's a fermented
vegetable similar sauerkraut Koreans consume per person about 40 pounds of
kimchi every single year so it's a combination of cabbage and onion and
garlic and radish chili pepper and ginger credible combination it's very
spicy the radish is really high in sulfur so the garlic and the onions
which is really good for the liver to detox and the kidneys to detox and of
course cabbage as well so it's a great perm nted food has massive amounts of
vitamin C huge amounts of beta-carotene and also has vitamin k2 which is
normally seen in grass-fed dairy but it's also in sauerkraut and kimchi also
minerals calcium iron there's a B vitamins so we have the nutrients and
the vegetables and then we have the added benefit of the fermentation so
when you ferment vegetables you get a lot of friendly microbes friendly
bacteria and lactic acid and that lactic acid is very good to protect the immune
system to kill up unfriendly microbes to aid in the assimilation of minerals in
your gut so if you don't have enough acid in your large bowel you're not
going to simulate as many nutrients so it also improves bad breath and chronic
halitosis so make sure you start including more fermented vegetables into
your diet thanks for watching hey you probably already subscribed but if you

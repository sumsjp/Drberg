all right tell me about your
success I came to the Health and
Wellness Center about 3 weeks
ago and I couldn't
sleep 5 hours in a row I'd wake up every
hour and I'd get almost no sleep so I
came twice a week for the past three
weeks
and now just last night the night before
and the night before 8 hours in a row
non-stop didn't wake up doesn't take me
3 hours to fall asleep anymore I can
just sleep the whole night through and
it's awesome it's a dream come true I'm
so I'm so happy to sleep and it really
correlates to other
uh positive things in my life like less
back pain and um just more
calm uh way of life that's great

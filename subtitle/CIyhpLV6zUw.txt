let's talk about the relationship between ketones on your mood not just depression
but anger irritability anxiety so many people who start the ketogenic diet in periodic prolonged
fasting experience a huge improvement in their mental health it really brings their mood
up from these lower emotions to a much greater emotion now i want to differentiate two things
one is your mood being affected by situations and maybe a mental problem if you get an argument with
someone and you're angry okay that's a direct cause and effect relationship but what about
the situation where you're just depressed you're irritable you're angry without that situation what
is up with that and it'd be really interesting to find out um the true percentage of people who are
depressed angry irritable and have anxiety and how much of that is related to just their fuel
for their brain and their overall brain chemistry especially because when you observe people going
on low carb and fasting there is a direct and immediate improvement in mood now there's been 15
studies showing the relationship between the ketogenic diet and mood and the results were
kind of mixed the results show there may be improvements in your mental status okay but if
you look at these studies some studies were just observational which use questionnaires which um
they're not very credible a lot of other studies were done in mice and how are you going to show
results with emotion on mice and also if you dig into the studies you're going to find out that
a lot of these studies weren't even using the ketogenic diet they weren't low carb and also a
human would never consume the diet that these mice were on so i don't know how valid those studies
would be and then yet other studies were just using ketones exogenous ketones not changing the
diet and so these studies don't really reflect the actual healthy version of the ketogenic
diet that i would recommend for someone and also they're not including fasting because the way you
get into ketosis is a low-carb diet or fasting or a combination of both but the benefits on
your emotional state is not just ketones but when you're doing fasting there's a lot of other things
that can occur with additional brain chemicals being increased like brain derived neurotrophic
factor which i'm going to do a video on but here's what we know there's a condition called
brain insulin resistance where the brain is not getting enough insulin and so we have a decreased
insulin sensitivity and there's definitely a direct effect on having that condition in
being depressed or having a lowered mood we also know that diabetics are three times more likely
to get depression we also know that metformin which directly addresses insulin resistance has
been shown to decrease depression nasal insulin sprays when you spray insulin right up into
the sinuses and it can go directly into the brain has been shown to decrease depression as well so
when you fix this insulin resistance thing you definitely improve the mood we also know that when
you do fasting you have an increased absorption of tryptophan which is a precursor to serotonin which
is like the happy hormone that actually makes you happier so there's all this additional data that
supports doing the ketogenic diet and fasting to increase your mood so my question is this
what happens when you diagnose someone with the wrong problem what are the consequences of that
if a person has a physically caused depression coming from their diet and you diagnose them with
some mental illness or mental disease and worse yet treat them with a drug that has side effects
what are the consequences of that i mean you can really mess someone up if you give them the wrong
diagnosis telling them your problem is this when in actuality it's to sing completely over here
and so if you are new to my channel and you have some lowered emotional state and you haven't tried
the ketogenic diet yet or fasting i challenge you to try it out because i think you're going
to notice a huge shift in how you feel now i recently interviewed a guy a fascinating success
story which i'm going to put the link down below if you haven't seen this you have to watch this
here's a man that had seriously high blood sugars i'm talking in the 700s okay he was going
into a coma he was rushed to the hospital he was overweight depressed on a medication um and so he
decided to do himself in and stop eating for four days and it backfired he started feeling better
he started feeling happier which is fascinating so he accidentally did fasting and found out
surprisingly that his depression went away when he started doing fasting
he stumbled on one of my videos he started the ketogenic diet he started doing fasting
and you have to watch the success story because he pulled himself completely right out of that
deep dark state of depression and now not only has he lost weight and had health benefits
but he's happy he no longer has depression his willpower is excellent so number one you have the
relationship between brain insulin resistance and your mood you also have something called the hpa
axis okay hypothalamus pituitary adrenal pathway what happens if that pathway is altered and you
have higher amounts of cortisol you're gonna have anxiety so the ketogenic diet and doing fasting
can improve that situation as well and then you have the direct effect on dopamine which is like
the pleasure hormone and the more sugar someone has and the more carbohydrates the more problem
they're going to have with dopamine and the more dopamine resistance they're going to have
and you're not going to be able to experience pleasure if you have a problem with dopamine
so that would equate to depression and apathy and then you have the direct effect on serotonin
if you're on a high carb diet that's going to directly inhibit the ability to express
serotonin and when you do fasting you increase the absorption of tryptophan which is a precursor to
serotonin you increase the absorption of serotonin and you become happier and lastly you have the
effect on the hippocampus it's a known fact that diabetics have atrophy of the hippocampus and
that's the structure in the brain that affects memory learning and when you have atrophy of
this part of the brain people get depressed so in conclusion i challenge you to try this diet and
fasting at the same time to see if it can actually pull you out of some of these lower emotions
to a much higher emotional state click down below for more information on how to do that
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

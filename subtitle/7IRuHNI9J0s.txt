hey guys it's dr. Berg here I want to explain what is behind cracked lips and
sometimes you see people with like really dry cracked lips that is a
deficiency of vitamin b2 and vitamin b3 now here's the thing what would create a
deficiency of b2 and b3 well you got several things one definitely alcohol
will do it alcoholics always are deficient in these two but typically
what I find it's too much refined flour products now if you notice when you buy
flour products like bread it's always enriched with B vitamins right why is
that because refined wheat products deplete you of those B vitamins so they
put them back in because they're empty and if you if you consume them actually
deplete you of those B vitamins you'll end up with the B vitamin deficiency if
you consume a lot of flour products and that would be in the bread the pasta
cereal the crackers are this gets the waffles things like that which I know
you never eat but probably you know people will do now there's other reasons
why you can have crack lips as well you know you could be zinc deficient you can
be vitamin A deficient okay but this is the it's usually too many wheat products
now what foods have b2 and b3 one of the best foods that I like is egg yolks yeah
the to the the things that people think that are going to increase your
cholesterol which is absolutely positively true because it will increase
your good cholesterol it will not increase your bad cholesterol okay
so that's the point and by the way you may have already known this but your
body makes cholesterol it makes a lot it makes 3,000 milligrams a day yeah your
liver makes 2,000 and your rest your body make a thousand that's 3000
milligrams of cholesterol that's equivalent to 14 eggs that's equivalent
to three hundred strips of bacon that's equivalent of a pound of butter so the
point is that if you makes that much adding some egg yolks is
not going to be a big deal because your body will just make less okay because
you need cholesterol but that's a whole other video but egg yolks have the B
vitamins they have the vitamin A they have the zinc so that's what I would
recommend I personally do at least three eggs a day okay I think that's it's a
really good multivitamin mineral but make sure you eggs are pasture-raised
not pasteurized pasture-raised organic now here's the other thing that's
interesting is allow the animal products that you buy our fed grains that are GMO
genetically modified that pesticides and things like that and those grains tend
to affect the nutrition in the animal as well so if you're doing like
pasture-raised eggs versus just regular eggs or you're doing
I don't know grass-fed beef versus regular grain-fed you're getting a much
better quality nutrient profile alright but if you want to fix your cracked
lips just go ahead and have the egg yolks and you'll see that within like a
week or so that symptom will go away hope you like this and I'll see in the
next video

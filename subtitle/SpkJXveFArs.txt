today we're going to talk about a very significant scientific sounding condition
called onychocryptosis also known as an ingrown toenail don't ask me why they have to come up
with these incredibly long names for something so simple but what is an ingrown toenail it's where
your edges or the corner of your nail starts growing into the skin on your big toe but the
question is why and is it related to nutrition it can be low calcium or low vitamin d can cause this
condition without calcium the nail can grow soft and it can be distorted it can grow into your skin
it could also be that you're cutting your nail incorrectly normally you should cut your nail
straight across if you start rounding the edges it can kind of grow in to your tissues incorrectly
now another cause could be that your shoes are just too tight for your feet and it's pressing
onto your nail or lastly it could be a toenail injury let's say you do kickboxing or soccer or
you had a direct injury on your toe like i did i remember one time i was lifting these weights
and i had these 25 pound plates and for some reason i dropped one and i was wearing sandals
yes that was not good and i had some some serious pain in my big toe and that could be the reason
why i still to this day have toe pain but injury to the toe could also cause your nail to grow
inward into the tissues all right there's my short video for you thanks for watching

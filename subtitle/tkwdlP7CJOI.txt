let's talk about what caused your diabetes okay if you have diabetes this
video is for you and it's a very important video for you to understand
how you got there okay first thing I want to talk about is normal blood sugar
a person who is healthy should normally have about eighty milligrams per
deciliter of sugar in their blood and what does this mean it means that
you basically have about one teaspoon of sugar in your blood that's not that much
an average American consumes 31 teaspoons of sugar but why do they have
normal blood sugars I mean it doesn't make sense you would think that this
blood sugar would go up immediately right well it doesn't because of this
one thing and the hormone is called insulin anything more than one teaspoon
all over the blood and it hides it in other places in the body it's basically
a storage hormone but with ironic is that the blood sugars are tested but
insulin is rarely tested if they were to test it test the average American they
would find this screaming high why because an average person consumes 31
teaspoons per day of sugar in order to do with all that excess this hormone is
just working overtime 24/7 what does this hormone do with the sugar well it
has to put it somewhere so what it does is it converts it first to the fat cell
then it starts putting it into what's called a subcutaneous fat which is the
superficial layer of fat just beneath your skin ok so there's quite a bit of
surface area for your body to store fat in that way so that goes down to your
period of time then what happens you start developing what's called ectopic
fat and that topic fat is the fat outside the fat cell okay it's outside
the subcutaneous fat and your body was never designed for this to happen okay
because we're talking about fat being now stored in the liver and then in the
muscles and then in the heart it's very similar
to a hoarder at first this person is storing stuff in different cabinetry
okay but over time things start building up in the kitchen and the living room
and the bathroom until there's no place to live or exist their spacing is
becoming less and less less until finally they cannot even open the
refrigerator and you start developing rats and all sorts of problems and they
get very very sick but guess what if you're consuming this much sugar the
insulin hormone has now become a hoarder and not only is it going to start to
pack up the liver with fat and the muscle in the heart but it eventually
spills over into the pancreas when this happens as another protective mechanism
you're developing insulin resistance as well but here's the big point I want to
make you won't really develop diabetes until the pancreas starts filling up
with fat it's not that the cells of the pancreas that make insulin are burning
out the pancreas is being clogged up with fat and that is what's creating the
dysfunction causing the diabetes diabetes is a state where the blood
sugars start to go too high it's out of control blood sugars why because you
lose the insulin function why because your pancreas is clogged up but this is
the entire cascade of things that happen if you continue to eat too much sugar
and insulin is too high your doctor would have picked it up if they would
have done a fasting insulin test or a test called Homa I R which is a another
test to measure both fasting insulin and your glucose to measure insulin
resistance well that's very interesting but now what do you do about it the cool
thing is this if you have diabetes type 2 your pancreatic cells are not
burnt-out they can be reversed they can come back how if you remove the fat from
the pancreas how do you do that you go on a healthy keto plan you start
doing in a minute fasting and as that fat starts to come off these organs the
cells start to reverse and you no longer have diabetes if you're new to my
channel and you would like to know what to eat to start taking the fat off the
pancreas as well as the fat of the liver I put that video right here check it out

let's talk about xanthan gum and guar gum are they both keto-friendly and if you
had a choice which one is better or worse let's start with xanthan gum it's
used in a lot of different foods as a food thickener to provide texture they
use it in recipes to make bread because it replaces like the gluten it's an
additive here's the problem it's usually made from corn glucose or even soy so if
you were to consume this you want to make sure it's non-gmo okay if it's non-gmo
it'll be okay but if it's GMO you don't want to consume it because of the corn
and the soy and then who knows where they got the glucose from right there
now there's a certain bacteria called Xanthomonas campestris if I spelled that
right I have no idea but you can see the name xantham xanthan that's where it
comes from so this bacteria ferments corn glucose or soy obviously the
carbohydrate in those three and it gives you this gum okay
so 1/2 of a teaspoon is 1.6 grams equals one carb but it also has one gram of
fiber giving a zero net carb so this will not affect your blood sugar so yes
it is keto friendly but make sure it's a non GMO source
okay now gar gum what's that it comes from the guar bean and a half a teaspoon
1.5 grams only will give you one gram of carb in one gram of fiber also giving
you a zero net carb so this is good as well so these are very similar but the
big difference is the source so just make sure if you do this it is non GMO
this one is going to be non GMO naturally because they don't genetically
modify this being alright so if you haven't seen my video on acceptable
fluids on a ketogenic diet you might want to check that one out that's a real
popular one I think I have like 4 million views check it out right here

now in this video I'm going to talk about autism and what I personally would
recommend to parents who have a child who developed autism now there are
certain things that unfortunately I can't really talk about for various
reasons related to this topic so I'm going to keep this fairly basic but this
is what I would recommend for a child who is suffering from autism first
question is what is different about an autistic brain in a normal brain one big
thing is this there's a defect in autophagy autophagy is a condition where
the cells are cleaning up old damaged proteins it's like a recycler so if
there's a defect in the ability to clean up damaged brain tissue or waste
products in the brain or some by-product in the brain that shouldn't be there it
can leave the brain overly excited and create a lot of cognitive problems
there's also a high incident of low vitamin D in autistic children low
folate which by the way low folate allows the cells to be damaged very
easily because folate helps protect the DNA from being damaged so you having a
lot of damage in the brain and a lot of free radical damage and oxidative stress
you're also getting some dysfunction in the myelin that's the outer covering
around the nerves and brain neurons so we're getting a dysfunction of that
myelin and there's usually always are we related intestinal problem with these
kids over 90% of the time they have big swollen bellies now there's actually a
connection between the digestive system and the brain it's called the vagus
nerve and the vagus nerve works like this the information going down to the
gut from the brain there's only 10% the information coming from the gut to the
brain is like 90% so the freeway brings a lot of information from the gut
up to the brain so I really think there's this missing connection in the
gut that needs to be restored which could be contributing to a lot of
problems in the cognitive area now one thing that is known is that a lot of
symptoms do occur after breastfeeding when the child is put on formula however
a lot of kids get autism roughly about age four but sometimes they get it
earlier now in these formulas they have a lot of things that children can be
allergic to from soy from the protein in the milk like casein to all sorts of
other chemicals not to mention the glucose and the sugar and all the other
things they put in there so the first recommendation I want to say is try to
breastfeed your child as long as possible okay I'm not talking about till
age 16 I'm just talking about a few years okay
next thing is that you must read gluten from the diet you are probably already
doing this but gluten just literally tears up the gut in these children and
creates all sorts of inflammatory responses and that can actually greatly
affect the brain chemistry next one rid casein it's a very common allergy and a
lot of times they put this in the formula you want to avoid gluten and
encasing okay grains and milk products you may find a huge benefit just from
that alone next thing you want to do some type of detox for heavy metals
specifically mercury you can watch other videos on that but mainly I want to just
talk about what remedy I would recommend is silica so look there's a really good
natural remedy to kind of counter that selenium is also one as well in fact
this is essential selenium will bind to a certain protein
and act as a very powerful antioxidant and it will help to lower the effects
the negative effects from heavy metals especially mercury zinc is essential for
certain parts of the brain to function especially those one
that are involved with autistic behavior the next thing is essential and if you
don't know about this you need to study up on it putting your child on the
healthy keto plan why because we know there's damage in the brain so you must
use an alternative fuel I would definitely recommend also exogenous
ketones and MCT oil for sure you can watch my videos on that but going on a
keto plan a low carb diet will allow the brain finally to get fed so ketones can
bypass the damaged part and feed the neurons directly glucose cannot do that
so this is very very important and you'll probably see huge changes just from that
alone now as far as fasting goes it's very difficult to have a small child
fast but at the very minimum maybe you just do three meals and no snacks that
would be very beneficial because of the benefits of fasting on your brain are
huge you can actually regrow new neurons when your fasting and maybe you just do
two huge meals that are very nutrient dense and that might work as well you
want to have this child consuming nutrient-dense foods it might be very
difficult so you might have to do some type of powdered green drink because a
lot of times they don't like eating vegetables but they need the folate okay
also they need a vitamin D vitamin D is really important in the brain it's
essential for the immune system and there's a lot of inflammation going on
in the brain as well also a vitamin C is very important and I'm not talking about
synthetic ascorbic acid I'm talking about the full vitamin C complex very
very very important if you have not seen my other video on the brain and brain
chemistry and what to do to support a healthy brain I put it right here check

hello dr. Berg here I had another question by someone who said I want to do the ketogenic diet
but I don't like veggies what do I do that is a situation because the problem is you're going
to burn a lot of fat and we want to keep the fat going through the liver in the gallbladder
and without vegetables it's hard to flush all that out not to mention you need the vitamins
and minerals and nutrients from the vegetables so number one I ask that person I said out of
all the vegetables is there anything that you do like okay and I had to even define and give
examples the vegetables because they don't even know that a cucumber was the vegetable
so they like cucumbers I said good then eat a bunch of cucumbers okay just do something
rather than nothing here's some ideas kale shake so you take kale and you can hide the
taste by putting berries if you need to add a banana in there or some more berries just
to really hide it completely go for it it's more important right now to get the kale so
you mix water I like to freeze it blend it with berries top it off with the water blend
it really well and drink your greens that way you can get a good amount of vegetable from a
high quality cruciferous vegetable number two you can use dips you can use hummus you can use
carrots celery cucumber with the hummus okay you can use other types of dips that actually
hide the taste of the vegetables it's another way to get vegetables in your body make them
taste better fermented vegetables let's see do you like pickles sauerkraut that would be
something that you could consume it's a little bit easier to digest some people can do a lot
of pickles haze it's a vegetable green powders you can actually substitute I would prefer if
you don't do all green powders but some are fine like the wheatgrass juice powder if you
do powders I would get the juice powder not just the powder from the greens okay so make
sure you the concentrated juice powder okay food concentrates now a lot of people also ask what
about your cruciferous vegetables can I just do these the answer is no these will enhance
the vegetables but they're not going to act as a substitute this is a whole cruciferous food it
has a lot of the key cruciferous with tumeric garlic and things like that and you take them
in tablets but you'd probably if you absolutely want to enhance that I would probably take up to
15 a day if you need to because like taking 3 a day thinking that's going to be your vegetables
it's not going to cut it but you need to do some vegetables as well it'll help steamed spinach with
protein like some people if you steamed spinach it's easier to consume put garlic maybe some tuna
maybe some chicken in there stir fry vegetables most people can do that but you're going to have
to bend a little bit to have some vegetables to be able to do this alright thanks for watching

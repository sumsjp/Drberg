i found some very interesting research
related to
how potassium can influence how much
calcium
builds up in your arteries it's actually
quite fascinating
now one of the best tests to determine
if you have calcium in your arteries
is a cac test a coronary artery
calcification
test and that test is probably one of
the best predictors
of overall mortality not just from heart
attacks
but from overall mortality so this study
that i just reviewed
showed for the first time that low
dietary potassium promotes
vascular calcification and
aortic stiffness as well as thickness
within the coronary
arteries now i will say this study was
on mice
so if your mice start developing high
blood pressure
you definitely need to apply this
information now this is huge because
so many people do not get the amount of
potassium they need
in fact they don't even know how much
they need they need a lot
an average person needs about 4 700
milligrams
every single day so to get that they're
going to have to consume a good amount
of dietary potassium if you
don't know what that is i put a link
down below for more information on how
to get your potassium
from your diet but the question is why
why does calcium deposit
on your arteries if you are low in
potassium and this is the reason
these two electrolytes potassium and
calcium work together
when you're low in potassium calcium
tends to build up
on the inside of the cell now this is
quite important information simply
because
the number one cause of death is heart
attack
and so if a person is getting high blood
pressure
they need to start looking at potassium
if you take a look at like
calcium channel blockers which is one of
the medications that they use for high
blood pressure
the mechanics of that drug is basically
lowering calcium
but what if they increase potassium well
i have found in practice
the patients who do more potassium do
much better with their blood pressure
more potassium less blood pressure also
when you take vitamin d
your blood pressure can come down i
think a lack of potassium is part of the
problem
another problem is inflammation in your
arteries because in order for that
calcium to start depositing on the
inside of the artery
you first have to have inflammation and
that usually comes from some type of
oxidation
in combination with low antioxidants
like low amounts of vitamin d
low vitamin c which occur from consuming
too much refined flour products and then
if you combine too much sugar which is
going to create
oxidation you're going to get the
perfect storm because you're going to
get
number one inflammation that's going to
start the whole process
and the calcium coming in as a band-aid
and the fact that when you're eating
sugar and refined
carbohydrates you're depleting your
potassium
you're depleting your vitamin e and your
vitamin c
so it's the perfect storm and so we have
this combination
related to heart disease we have low
potassium
we have low antioxidants coming from
eating the wrong things in your diet
and also a lack of vitamin d which can
act as an anti-inflammatory
vitamin d3 works with vitamin k2 and
also
mobilizing that calcium to make sure
that it stays in the bone
and out of the arteries so anyway i
wanted to talk about the
importance of potassium in preventing
arterial stiffness as well as
calcification building up in your
arteries
very very interesting hey before you go
if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would
love to hear about your success story
please share it in the link down below

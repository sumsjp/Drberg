i'm going to talk about the benefits of bee sting therapy now of course when you get stung by a bee
it's very painful it swells up it creates inflammation so why would someone ever
want to get any benefit from the chemical from a bee sting doesn't make sense well here's the thing
in larger amounts bee stings are very toxic and very irritating to your body and they're
very painful but in very small amounts i believe it's more of a hermetic effect where
you give a small dosage of something and your body then responds by creating a stress which
then adapts and strengthens your immune system because it has the ability to shift
certain parts of your immune system that normally cause an allergy to then strengthen it to actually
even get rid of an allergy and that's why it's even good to reduce or even get rid of an
allergy to a bee sting so that's pretty cool it's antimicrobial and of course it's anti-inflammatory
under low doses and it improves something called the t regulatory cells which help to modulate or
reduce an over immune reaction or something that's actually inflammatory so it actually reduces
inflammation so it's also good for arthritis skin irritation skin disorders it's good for chronic
pain it's even good for parkinson's and ms so something you may want to look into if you're uh
if you have any of these problems but the isolated compound in this venom is militant if you really
wanted to know all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

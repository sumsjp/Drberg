now is it possible to build muscle and lose fat at the same exact time
well let's talk about each point and how they relate to each other let's start with exercise
exercise is responsible for about 15 of fat loss and so your diet would contribute to about 85
percent so there is some benefits of exercise for fat loss the key with building and maintaining
muscle growth is this right here intensity of exercise as well as the volume of exercise because
if you're doing keto and you're losing weight and you drop out your exercise you're not going to
continue to build muscle in fact it might shrink a couple other points to consider recovery of the
exercise if you over train and don't recover let's say you're working out every single day
and also adding on to that you're not sleeping because you're stressed out
then the benefit of this is not going to be there so you really need all these factors in place
the cool thing about exercise is it can stimulate growth hormone up to 700 that's huge and growth
hormone helps you build muscle now let's switch to the carbs the lower the carb the more the weight
loss right but carbs stimulate insulin which is an anabolic hormone it makes things grow so now
we have a problem if we go with too many carbs over 50 grams it's going to stop the weight loss
but what if we did this what if we consumed a little more protein what if we kept our carbs
lower definitely below 50 grams and we increased our protein a little bit more than 8 ounces per
meal what that's going to do it's going to increase insulin and glucagon now i will say
that too much protein can potentially slow down your weight loss so it's a bit of a balancing act
between having the right amount of protein and the right amount of carbs so maybe you're going
to play around between 30 to 50 grams of carbs and keep your protein between 8 ounces and then
maybe try to increase it a little bit to actually provide a little bit more insulin to the muscles
but at the same time increasing glucagon which actually helps you burn more fat and so this point
right here the carb amount and protein amount is an individual thing you have to play around with
this to get the sweet spot but i just want you to understand the relationship between these two
fat provides energy for doing more exercise if you go low fat and you're doing fasting you could
potentially make your body a bit too tired and not have the energy to do the exercise so we need a
certain amount of fat we don't want to go below 75 grams and that will force your body to burn
more of its own fat and not turn the dietary fat as much into ketones but having sufficient amounts
of dietary fat in your diet will definitely help the next factor right here which is
fasting fasting is the most powerful thing to lose weight because it dramatically brings your insulin
way down and if you're doing consistent fasting you can handle a little more protein
because you're going to give your body a chance and the time to digest a larger amount of protein
now as far as fasting and your muscles go when you fast you could potentially stimulate growth
hormone up to 2 000 percent now let's compare this to exercise which is 700 percent you get a major
spike in growth hormone when you do fasting and growth hormone is all about building
muscle and when you fast there's also a protein sparing effect that occurs and that means simply
that your body is not going to be using your own muscle protein as fuel it protects the muscles
of course there's going to be a point where you burn off all your fat and then the body is going
to starve and use its muscles but it's not going to happen when you do routine fasting or even
periodic prolonged fasting one point about fasting it's very important to consume enough sea salt
about one to one and a half teaspoons a day with potassium and magnesium to get your electrolytes
if you don't do this your energy is going to go down it's called keto fatigue and you will
not be able to exercise because your muscles are not going to have the electrolytes they're going
to get tired in all of your cells you have what's called a sodium potassium pump that generates the
electrical energy to allow the muscles and nerve to work so as you can see now the importance of
how these different factors relate to each other to build muscle while you lose the fat
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

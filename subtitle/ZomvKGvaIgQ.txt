so today we're going to talk about why eggs are especially important for a
postmenopausal female eggs and I'm talking about the yolks are loaded with
choline and choline is a vitamin to help strip fat off the liver it actually can
prevent a fatty liver if you're deficient in choline you can be more
susceptible to getting a fatty liver it also helps dissolve lipids or fats
so it supports bile salts which also break down fats so for example if you're
on the ketogenic diet and you have a difficulty in digesting fats and you're
taking purified bile salts for the gallbladder and you find that there's
something missing choline is missing a choline deficiency can also cause
constipation and even affect a memory because choline is kind of like a
building block for acetylcholine which is involved in nerve physiology why is
choline good postmenopausal versus pre menopausal well because women that are
postmenopausal have lesser amounts of estrogen
now even though their estrogen dominant because their progesterone really drops
way down and it gives them a ratio of too much estrogen but it's compared to
progesterone but if we look at the total amount of estrogen postmenopausal it's
gonna be a lot lower and estrogen protects against the loss of choline
some women will take estrogen after they're postmenopausal the problem with
that it has some complications like increasing your risk of cancer
increasing your risk of stroke things like that
choline is a really good supplement for women that are postmenopausal if they
have a difficulty in digesting fat and also just if they start to develop fat
in the liver this can actually help reverse it having a fatty liver also
sets you up for getting cirrhosis choline can kind of stop that whole
process from occurring you need about four hundred twenty-five milligrams a
day and realize that your body does make some choline but not nearly enough you
can get choline from egg yolks and organ meats and other foods which I'll put a
link down below but just want to do this video based on a
question I had someone was postmenopausal and they started to
develop the fatty liver and they wanted to know what do they do well this is

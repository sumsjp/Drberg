so what would actually happen if you've got rid of all the bacteria that's
living inside your body you have a hundred trillion microbes growing
outside and inside your body right now that's ten times the amount of your
actual physical body cells okay if you were to wipe out all the microbes in
your colon which is the majority what would potentially happen well let's
first take a look at what these microbes actually do ninety percent of all of
your bile that is made from your liver stored in your gall bladder gets
recycled by microbes okay so right there you would have low
amounts of bile salts so therefore you could not absorb vitamin A D E k-1
k-2 you wouldn't be able to absorb omega-3
fatty acids the other essential fatty acids you would have a major deficiency
of certain healthy fats in your body which have all sorts of consequences you
wouldn't be able to make the B vitamins anymore or the vitamin K you wouldn't be
able to make this compound okay so so the microbes actually eat the fiber from
your diet and turn it into this which helps your blood sugars and it also
feeds your colon cells so you wouldn't be able to feed your colon cells your
immune system would greatly suffer the majority of your immune system is in
your gut but the microbes actually help defend against pathogens that's why for
example the lactic acid microbes make lactic acid to actually make an
environment where these microbes can't live you wouldn't have any lactic acid
as a defense you wouldn't be able to maintain the epithelial gap so you would
have leaky gut so you'd have a lot of allergies and immune problems and food
intolerances you wouldn't have this immune defense mucus Blair you would
have a neurotransmitter deficiency because these microbes actually make
proteins especially serotonin 90% of your serotonin is made but with by these
microbes in your gut so if you got rid of 90% of your serotonin you wouldn't be
a very happy camper you wouldn't be able to counter infection you would be filled
with in flu nation you would have blood sugar issues
you wouldn't be able to absorb nutrients like vitamins and minerals and proteins
and lastly you would lose your ability to detoxify but other than that you'd be
perfectly healthy I'm being very sarcastic now I have other videos
talking about how we lose our friendly bacteria but I want to touch on
antibiotics for a second because all it takes is one week of exposure to an
antibiotic to affect the diversity of microbes and the quantity of microbes
for six months to two years also if a mother doesn't breastfeed that child is
a lot more susceptible to allergies and asthma same thing goes with c-section
delivery versus a natural vaginal birth but the big point of this video I'm
going to talk about is this right here 80% of antibiotics are not sold for
human consumption but they're sold to companies that use the antibiotics as a
growth factor for animals okay so so for example if you go to the store and buy
commercial steak chicken pork and it's non-organic
chances are it's exposed to antibiotics so now I have some good news and some
bad news what do you want to hear first the good news okay well thank goodness
in 2017 the FDA came out with a rule stating that antibiotics can no longer
be used for growth or feed efficiency unless supervised by a veterinarian
that's exciting now we can actually finally get rid of
the antibiotics and get our bodies back to health right well the bad news is
that there's no definition of antibiotic free and there's been no reduction in
the antibiotics given to these animals after this rule was passed in 2017 why
because there's this thing called a loophole that they're using okay because
it says no longer can be used for growth or feed efficiency so what they
using now as they're not using it for growth at least they're not saying
they're using it for growth they're using it to prevent disease disease
prevention so just by changing the intent they continue to use the
antibiotics what the FDA should have said is that antibiotics should no
longer be used period okay but unfortunately that's not what happened
so here's what I recommend when you buy your animal products farmers markets
okay health food store organic at least with
an organic certification they're not supposed to be using antibiotics or
pesticides alright guys thanks for watching

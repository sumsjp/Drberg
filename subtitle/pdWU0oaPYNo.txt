so let's talk about postmenopausal estrogen now before you go through
menopause roughly about age 50 52 the ovaries are working and they're
producing estrogen but after your ovaries go into retirement when you're
in menopause postmenopausal you're gonna be getting your estrogen from other
places not necessarily the ovaries and the biggest place you're gonna get it
from is from your fat cell now if you have a lot of fat on your body then
you're gonna actually start making excess amounts of estrogen and you're
also going to convert some of your adrenal hormones into estrogen as well
but it's not as much as your fat unless you don't have a lot of fat then you'll
probably even be in better shape but if you have excess amounts of fat on your
body chances are you're gonna convert that into estrogen and there's an enzyme
that helps with that and this is one of the reasons why women end up with
estrogen dominance after menopause and they have all these issues whether it's
cancer hot flashes night sweats vaginal dryness lowered mood depression
irritability all these different things not to mention if you have a fatty liver
which a lot of women do have you're not going to be able to clear out estrogen
properly and estrogen will build up even more so you end up with this situation
when you have way too much estrogen and now that estrogen can also put on more
fat and you're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place and there's three
types of estrogen Estrone estradiol and estriol okay estriol
happens pretty much only when you're pregnant so we're not going to talk
about that Estrone and estradiol are the biological active forms of estrogen and
this one is produced by the adrenal your dreams are being converted to estrogen
through an enzyme called aromatase and then you have estradiol that is made
from the ovary your own fat or the adrenal hormones so
what can you do well one of the things you could do is you can actually take a
natural aromatase inhibitor okay and I listed eight of them right here if you
consume some of these what that will do that will inhibit this conversion and
you'll make less estrogen of course it's a given that I'm always going to
recommend the healthy keto eating plan as well as intermittent fasting and if
you're new to my channel I put a link down below but for most of you that know
about my videos you've heard me say this a million times you want to get on that
plan especially if you're going through menopause okay number one the white
button mushroom okay that is a legitimate aromatase inhibitor then we
get stinging nettle root okay I love this herb because it will also reduce
inflammation greatly it's really good for the liver grape seed extract is
another one maca okay this has a lot of nutrition as well it's a certain leaf
so it will give you additional properties and then we have
quercetin which is an anti-inflammatory it's also good for
sinus allergies and allergies in general but it can also help regulate estrogen
licorice root is another one that will help you support healthy estrogen levels
then we got another thing to call genistein which is extract from soy
which I usually never recommend but in this case if you're getting an organic
source it it's a property that will help you stop making so much estrogen okay
and then dim which is a concentrated cruciferous vegetable blend that will
also help to regulate the amount of estrogen you're making now if you
haven't seen my other videos on menopause check them out I put them up
right here

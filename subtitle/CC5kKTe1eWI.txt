so let's talk about raynaud's syndrome what is it it's a condition where your fingertips
turn literally blue or purple usually after exposure to cold because cold is a trigger
stress can trigger it but what's happening you're having this spasm in your arteries
and your blood flow and you're getting this pool of venous blood and it can last for minutes
to hours okay and the treatment is usually avoid cold and or give you some type of medication
that involves influencing your sympathetic nervous system which is part of the autonomic nervous
system which gives us a clue on where the problem might be this problem really comes from a failure
of your autonomic nervous system to adapt to cold and the risk factors could be having a history of
frostbite women in their 20s and 40s and having estrogen dominance so estrogen can trigger
this condition now there's primary reynodds which is idiopathic which means unknown cause or
it occurred spontaneously okay or it could be secondary and that comes from a connective tissue
disorder like lupus or some type of autoimmune condition what do you do about it what can you
take to resolve this vitamin b1 has shown some remarkable improvements in reducing symptoms from
raynaud's i'm going to put the link down below but and vitamin b1 also helps women balance estrogen
so if you have estrogen dominance vitamin b1 can help so maybe that's why it works
but there's another reason too because vitamin b1 helps support the autonomic nervous system
and this problem is usually a problem with the autonomic nervous system so b1 can greatly
help there's another remedy that i'm going to recommend it's called inositol hexanocotinate
which is a combination of vitamin b3 and inositol and it just so happens that this condition helps
improve vein circulation which is affected by cold so those are the two remedies that i'm going to
recommend for raynauds before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

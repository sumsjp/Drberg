i want to talk about the relationship between bile acids and cholesterol it's really important
information especially if you're concerned about your cholesterol but bile acids are made by your
liver they're also made by your friendly bacteria but the thing that i want you to know about is
that 75 of all the cholesterol in your body is made by your own body and only 25 comes from
food so when you have high cholesterol people tend to freak out and they start to get on medication
and what they don't realize is that your body actually makes the majority of cholesterol they
might not also realize this very very important fact your bile acids are the primary pathway
for cholesterol catabolism now what is catabolism it's the process where your body is breaking
down complex molecules to simple molecules so in this case your body is breaking down cholesterol
into smaller particles so then you can use those small particles to make things like
vitamin d cellular membranes hormones and even bile in other words bile is made from cholesterol
and this is one of the problems that people have when they start taking a statin drug which blocks
the production of cholesterol and now we have a problem with the production of bile a problem with
the production of vitamin d and a problem with making cell membranes and hormones now number two
50 of all your daily cholesterol turnover which means the rate of being depleted and replaced
okay like recycled is controlled by bile salts and number three bile salts
help to regulate the ratios between ldl and hdl they actually will lower your ldl
and raise your hdl so when people go on a low carb diet sometimes their cholesterol might increase
and so this is not a bad thing it just means that your body is releasing more cholesterol
from the fat cell but also if you're concerned you might want to take purified bile salts because
you might be lacking bile and that could be the reason why your cholesterol is a little bit too
high i'm talking about ldl and if you're not used to eating more fats you just might not have enough
production of bowel yet because your body has not adapted so it's another factor in why you might
have high cholesterol and just so you know bile salts have many purposes okay i just mentioned
one the regulation of cholesterol but it also acts as a detergent to help break down fat so you can
actually extract the fat soluble nutrients vitamin a d e and k which have to do with your vision
which have to do with preventing bruising that would be vitamin k1 vitamin k2 has to do with
calcium transportation out of the arteries and the joints vitamin e has to do with the heart
the pituitary fertility and you probably know what vitamin d does anti-inflammatory
helps you lower blood sugar helps your immunity helps bring up your mood and bile also can help
with supporting a healthy liver as well as helping you extract the essential fatty acids like omega-3

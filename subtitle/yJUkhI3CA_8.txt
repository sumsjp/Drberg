hi guys this is dr. Berg in this short video I want to discuss this thing called keto rash
here you go on this ketogenic diet and you end up with this terrible rash right what is that
well if you look it up there's hardly a lot of information on this there's not much information
it's hard to know what it is and so people try all sorts of things and they start eating more
carbs and let me tell you what I think it is and I think this is just my theory and what it is if
you look at a rap you this rash it's usually itchy okay it's called pruritus and itchiness
is really coming from the liver high levels of what's called histamines are dumped up in the
liver because when you switch over to ketogenic or you're running on ketones all you're releasing
tons and tons of fat that's coming out through the liver okay and if you don't consume enough
vegetable so you're going to actually end up with a fatty liver but you're dumping more fat okay and
that fat holds a lot of stuff like chemicals and toxins and things like that but what happens if
you don't have enough bile B I L E okay in your gallbladder and you do the ketogenic diet you
might not be able to release though the toxins that are coming out with the fat in a proper
matter and you're going to create a little bit of the immune reaction with these histamines okay
because one of the purposes of bile is to break down fats but the other purpose is to eliminate
toxins so here you are jumping trying to get rid of these toxins but you don't have enough bile to
handle the fat on the ketogenic diet and then you end up with this rash so what is the solution you
need to add some purified bile salts you can use my formula which is the gallbladder formula or
you can just find some purified bile salts but what will happen is that will increase the flow
of bile through the liver and gall bladder so you eliminate the toxins a lot better and reduce this
rash this reaction that's occurring alright thanks for watching I'll see you next video

hey guys Dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about diagnosing your
stool alright number one if the stool is hard little round chunks like little
balls that are dry that means you're doing too much protein I'll have people
do like protein shakes and that's all they're consuming no vegetables and
that's what they get okay because if the protein absorbs a lot of the water in
the fluid from your intestinal tract number two unform flakes it's almost
like a borderline diarrhea and that usually comes from eating certain people
eat salads or even the kale shake or some leafy greens they haven't developed
the enzymes to actually digest that material or maybe they ate too much and
the microbes that live off the fiber are overwhelmed and so they just cause you
to dump it okay so that means you're doing a little too much of the wrong
type of salad or green okay you have to mix it up change the vegetable to
something else okay and the enzymes that are supposed to digest that come from
microbes because microbes make enzymes so it's really a lack of a certain
microbe number three floating stool that means that you have too much fat in your
stool because you don't have enough bile B I le from the gallbladder in which
case you need some gallbladder formula to help some give you some bile to help
to break down that fat okay next one skid marks on the toilet and inside the
toilet that's a pancreas problem because you
don't have the enzyme called lipase and the pancreas so the pancreas is not
releasing an enzyme to digest that and you get this like black tarry stool type
thing okay so you need more pancreatic enzymes alright and by the way
pancreatic enzymes are in the gall bladder formula so I put that in there
called pancreatic the digestive part of the pancreas okay
lastly dry stool that happens to be a lack of just friendly flora friendly
bacteria it means you need more probiotic that helps you lubricate that
and helps you digestion and creates kind of a little
occasionally now one last thing is if you have blood in the stool or it's red
you know rule out if it's a beat situation if you just eight beats
because that could cause it or it could be a hemorrhoid okay that's the usual
common cause okay and lastly I don't know if you've ever saw a stool sample
I'm not sure if you have so I actually brought one to show you what a stool
sample looks like okay so this is what it looks like it's brown and it looks
like this okay so that's if you're curious about what it looks like that's
what it looks like alright I'll see in the next video have a good one let's go

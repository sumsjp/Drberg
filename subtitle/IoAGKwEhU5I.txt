you probably have seen my other videos on stress and adrenal fatigue i've done quite
a few in this video i'm going to talk about the non-stress cause of adrenal fatigue now
so many people are stressed out and they're burnt out but some people have adrenal fatigue and they
really haven't been through stress and they're wondering why did i end up with an adrenal issue
with no stress so there's another cause of this but before i get into that let me just tell you
what the adrenal gland does the adrenal gland has two parts an outside and an inside the inside is
all neurological tissue it makes neurotransmitters it's called the adrenal medulla the outside
is all glandular and that makes hormones like cortisol and a few others now the adrenal medulla
is primarily part of the autonomic nervous system specifically the sympathetic nervous
system which is the flight or fight you have the opposing system called the parasympathetic
and that is located in your brain stem it's located in a few other places
but for this video we're just going to focus in on the adrenals
and also the brain stem so the parasympathetic nervous system which is located in the brain stem
kind of counteracts the sympathetic fight or fight mode so it's all about rest digest and recovery so
if you experience stress you can activate the adrenals and eventually wear out the adrenals
but what about if you lose the parasympathetic control what happens then like you lose your
brake pads and from a non-stress source well that can actually create a sympathetic dominant
problem where you're kind of stuck in stress and you have all the symptoms and so the brain stem
is very sensitive to thymine b1 deficiencies so when you're deficient in b1 you can have all sorts
of problems with the brain stem specifically a lack of adaptation to stress because the autonomic
nervous system then starts becoming dysfunctional so one real simple way that you know that that
system is involved is if you stand up too quickly and you get dizzy or you might pass out there's
a severe condition called pots which also falls in this category but so many people get up from
a seated position or they get up too quick and they're like whoa and that could be an electrolyte
problem where you're low in salt or potassium but it can also be a b1 deficiency because the brain
stem needs b1 to work correctly being b1 deficient can create a lack of adaptation to gravity stress
and it can affect your ability to tolerate stress in general so it's not just about physical stress
it could be about adapting to mental stress as well as you may already know a b1 deficiency
can create anxiety and fatigue very similar to having just an adrenal gland that's burnt out and
having high levels of cortisol so it's very very similar the problem with vitamin b1 it's water
soluble and it doesn't store for very long i mean you could be completely depleted within 18 days
of not consuming vitamin b1 however it's not just about not consuming b1 it's about certain things
that actually directly create a deficiency the biggest thing is refine carbohydrates
whether it's grains or sugar that will create a huge problem and also the more carbohydrate
you consume the more the demand for b1 so if you consume a lot of carbs you're going to need a lot
of b1 to be able to metabolize those carbohydrates also alcohol is a big b1 depleter coffee can
create a b1 deficiency so those jittery feelings that you might feel if you drink too much coffee
if you took b1 boom goes away t with its tannic acid can create a b1 deficiency
sulfites which are in wine so we combine the alcohol and the sulphites can deplete your b1
antibiotics i've done a video on that can create a b1 deficiency diuretics can create a b1 deficiency
metformin the drug for diabetes can also create a b1 deficiency so in summary the symptoms of
adrenal fatigue are very very very similar if not identical to the symptoms of a b1 deficiency
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call

you know i've been having a lot of fun
with my new research tool um called
illicit.org
if you haven't heard about this it's a
great
search engine that allows you to
reach out to
200 million papers to find
information that is very difficult to
find when you do just general google
searches and of course i did a deep dive
on apple cider vinegar i wanted to see
if there's any additional benefits that
i haven't mentioned in other videos now
the main acid in apple cider vinegar is
called acetic acid
and
your
microbes make acetic acid in fact acetic
acid is the most abundant
short chain fatty acid now what do i
mean short chain fatty acid well your
microbes by digesting fiber
make this byproduct and it just so
happens that acetic acid is one of them
in fact it's the one that's over 50
so yes vinegar is a type of fatty acid
which is fascinating so this acetic acid
is like fuel for your colon cells in
other words 70
of the energy
that is needed from your colon cells
are received from these short chain
fatty acids and our human cells get
about 10 percent of its energy from
these short chain fatty acids and this
is why i mentioned in other videos that
apple cider vinegar can improve your
energy now you know why and in the other
videos i talked about the benefits of an
apple cider vinegar or your blood sugars

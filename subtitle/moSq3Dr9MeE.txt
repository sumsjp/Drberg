let's talk about the best diet or a bone fracture what foods should you be eating
once you had a fracture let's say you had some trauma like I did with my
shoulder and my elbow and my leg where actually broke the bone what foods would
be best and this also includes some type of surgery where they had to cut your
bone what what things you need to speed up the healing first let's talk about
what happens when you break a bone it is quite fascinating
how coordinated and organized your body is in healing a bone fracture in the
perfect sequence of events first thing that happens is you have this blood clot
around these two bones that have been broken and with that blood that rushes
in you have all sorts of things you have white blood cells you have growth
factors you have immune cells you have something called macrophages macrophages
are very large phagocytes which are cells that eat things so the macrophage
is going to do a lot of things it's going to clean debris it's going to
increase inflammation initially and then later it's going to decrease
inflammation the macrophage is essential and critical and making sure that this
bone heals correctly it's also going to make sure that that bone becomes solid
again if there's anything that slows down these macrophages it's going to
take longer and longer to heal it just happens what slows these guys down is
high levels of sugar in the blood this is why diabetics take longer to
heal so hyperglycemia high sugar in the blood
or a high carbohydrate diet you know those things that they feed you at the
hospital will slow down this white blood cell so we have the blood clot we have
the inflammation then we have the stem cells that could activate it stem cells
are undifferentiated cells their cells that don't have a purpose they can morph
into any cells that you need so the stem cell can turn into bone some fibrous
tissue or collagen so depending on what the body needs it may turn into one of
these initially though the stem cell is going to form soft bone or
like a splint to hold it together so it quickly goes in there and it will just
start forming a kind of a soft bone now if there's more emotion involved in this
process it's going to turn into more fibrin if there's no motion and it's
help from a cast or there's no motion it's going to turn directly into bone
right away so then we're gonna have the osteoblasts kicking osteoblasts are
those cells that build up bone that lay down bone okay if you can envision one
of those stingrays in the ocean that hover around the the bottom of the ocean
so this come in and kind of hover about and start depositing and making bone
throughout this process you're also going to get new blood vessels forming
new capillaries occurring the nerves are going to start to grow back if they were
damaged you're also going to have osteoclast worked as well the osteoclast
cells have the opposite function where they're cleaning things up they're
getting rid of bone so after a while after the osteoblasts do their job you
may see a callus well these guys are going to come in and they start cleaning
up that little callus so it's flattened so they're gonna do a bit of cleaning
and remodeling and they're gonna kick in after two weeks so these two cells go
back and forth in the production as well as the remodeling of the bone now as far
as what you need to eat we need to look at the composition of bone the raw
materials that make up bone sometimes people think you know when you drink
milk it's gonna build bone because bone is made out of calcium right well let's
take a look at how much calcium is in balance first of all one third of bone
is made up of collagen and not non collagen even lipids like fats make a
bone then you have one third is water and the last third is minerals so 48% of
the one third would be calcium 37% is phosphorus 1.2 9% is magnesium and then
you have silicon which is 0.12 percent and iron which is point
9% then you have a bunch of other trace minerals like zinc copper boron selenium
manganese so even though these are needed in trace minerals that's why
they're called a trace mineral these minerals are very important in
activating other enzymes to make this bone solid and work and functional so
the raw material bone is not just about calcium it's part protein other minerals
and also vitamins play a big part as well so the worst dot you'd want to be
on to heal the situation would be a high carbohydrate refined sugar low nutrient
diet you want to consume nutrient-dense foods get low carb as in healthy keto
and you want to definitely try to do some fasting that's gonna speed up
healing it'll stimulate the stem cells okay so it's gonna speed up the
formation of bone and other tissues as well vitamin E is gonna be really
important you're gonna get vitamin E from leafy greens nuts seeds zinc it's
all about red meat or shellfish or seafood salmon would have zinc liver has
zinc vitamin C sauerkraut you can do leafy vegetables
I wouldn't recommend doing the fruit thing because we don't want to add that
sugar unless you're gonna do berries alright vitamin d3 vital and vitamin k2
so both of these work together to make this bone really really solid vitamin D
helps absorb the calcium in the blood k2 takes it from the blood and pushes it
into the bone so some other really good things would be bone broth and then you
have bone itself now you could just chew on a bone okay but it's kind of it might
mess up your teeth but there are products or supplements that you can
find which have raw bone which would be a really good thing to take to give you
all of these and the right ratios I'm not going to recommend any brands you're
gonna have to do that research but the raw material of bone can help you build
bone and then you have trace minerals really really important and the
activation of the enzymes to help you repair this bone alright thanks for
watching if you're new to my channel and you
don't know anything about keto or intermittent fasting I put some videos up
here check them out

so recently i had another question on one of my videos that i'm going to
answer right here and the question was do i need fat to
stay in ketosis and number one in the very beginning
part of when you're starting keto you're going to adapt from sugar
burning to fat burning and if you're fat your
dietary fat is too low you're going to have a real rough time
because you're going to be hungry all the time
it's the dietary fat in the meal that makes you satisfied
that allows you to fast longer we have a reduced amount of insulin
and we have less insulin resistance and it makes it easier to get into ketosis
without being so hungry so definitely in the beginning
part and then there's a situation where you
don't want to lose any more weight that's myself
i weigh 180 right now and that's where i want to stay
if i don't do enough fat i'll keep losing weight
when you achieve your weight loss goal and you don't want to lose any more
weight you have to add more fat now this one
isn't involving getting enough fat soluble vitamins in your diet vitamin
a d e k okay so and also the essential fatty
acids like dha epa and there's actually other ones as
well if you're not doing the right types of fats
you can become deficient so obviously we want to
avoid that and prevent that by getting enough fat
so for example if you're eating fish there's a good amount of fat in
herring and salmon and halibut but white fish is very low in fat
so in salmon you have a lot more omega-3 fatty acids as compared to white fish
so really depends on the ratio of protein to fat
so with keto you really want to focus on getting enough fat with that protein
because you never want to do low fat proteins
on a ketogenic diet especially low fat high protein type foods soy protein
isolates terrible on the liver terrible in the kidney
however what makes someone get into keto is not the fat it's the lowering of the
carbohydrates when you lower the carbs your body is
forced to get ketones from either your diet
or your own fat to answer this question it depends

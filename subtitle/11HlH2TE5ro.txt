now there's a very important relationship between magnesium and vitamin d that i want to talk about
in order for you to absorb vitamin d you need magnesium because magnesium assists
in the activation of vitamin d both in the liver and the kidney and so vitamin d is dependent on
magnesium and so if you're deficient in magnesium that can lead to skeletal problems with your bone
cardiovascular issues mood issues specifically anxiety and depression inflammation and even an
increased risk of the metabolic syndrome which involves blood pressure blood high blood glucose
cholesterol belly fat and i just want to clarify something when i say that magnesium and vitamin
d are interlocked it doesn't mean that you have to take them at the same time it just means that
they have to be in your body as a reserve so you have enough so you can your body can take what it
needs so don't get concerned that you have to go and take magnesium at the same time taking
vitamin d my point is that you just don't want to be deficient in either one of these because
they're both dependent on each other because just as magnesium is required for vitamin d activation
vitamin d also stimulates the absorption of magnesium so they both work hand in hand

today we're going to talk about yacon syrup okay it's not keto friendly if you look up yacon
syrup on google you'll find a lot of conflicting information certain keto gurus will say oh yeah
it's fine you can have it it's going to help you lose weight when in fact it's not so let's talk
about why it won't help you lose weight so first of all what is it it's the root of the yacon plant
okay in peru 50 of it is foss which stands for fructo oligosaccharide it's a
prebiotic fiber now if you have any problem with candida sibo leaky gut any inflammation in the gut
and you take this it's going to blow you up just fyi 30 of this plant is fructose sugar now realize
fructose is low on the glycemic index simply because this sugar is only metabolized by your
liver not all of your cells so they consider it low but the truth is that it overwhelms the liver
and eventually creates insulin resistance there's a lot more to it and i put a link down below for
more information but you got to be careful with fructose because it really will create a fatty
liver so 30 of that is fructose and the rest is glucose so this is the reason why you don't want
to add this to your keto lifestyle because it's going to completely block your ability to get into
ketosis now maybe it's a little bit better than regular sugar but not by very much the glycemic
index of yacon syrup is 40 that's considered low but again it has the fructose and the glucose so
you want to stay away from it and that's despite one study that shows that it will help you lose
weight that was performed using a low-fat or low-calorie diet i just don't agree with that
study i think there's some flaws and if you're doing a keto diet and you're adding any sugar
to your diet at all that's going to prevent you from tapping into your fat all right that's a wrap
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

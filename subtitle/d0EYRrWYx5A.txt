we're going to talk about the seventh reason for weight loss plateau all right so you're doing
keto you think you're doing it correctly but it's maybe not working how do we make it work better
i've done a lot of videos on this but number one the most important thing is to make sure
your carbs are low and i'm talking below about 10 grams per day not per meal but per day so whatever
your carbs are bring them on the low side very important all right number two you may not be
fasting long enough so if you're on two meals a day you might need to go to one meal a day if
you're on one meal a day you may want to consider doing a longer fast so potentially you need to eat
once every other day but for some people with a very slow metabolism that's what they need to
do also the question they ask is this when you eat are you really hungry because if you're not hungry
keep fasting until you are hungry and i've had people go you know several days of fasting because
they just weren't hungry and that's totally fine just make sure you take your electrolytes and your
b vitamins if you're fasting all right so lowering carbs and decreasing the frequency of your meals
will get you into ketosis and it will help reduce inflammation if you have a lot of
inflammation in your body that's going to kill ketosis right off the bat all right number three
it could be that your stress is just too high this is going to activate cortisol and cortisol will
totally bump you out of fat burning so do whatever you can to lower your stress go for long walks i
have a lot of videos on this i will put some down below all right next point is your sleep cycles if
you have poor sleep you got to fix that there's a lot of reasons why people don't sleep big one is
stress so after you improve your stress that should help sleep if you can get an extra hour
of sleep that believe it or not will help you lose weight you burn the most fat when you're sleeping
and you have the most growth hormone when you're sleeping growth hormone is the main fat burning
hormone all right next one is exercise let's say you don't exercise well start exercising just
make sure that you recover from your exercise some people don't have the recovery they over exercise
to over train and that will slow down your weight loss but if your sleep is good and you're not over
training it's a perfect combination because then you're going to recover from the exercise all
right number six you're eating too much fat or too much protein now there's nothing wrong with eating
too much fat as long as your carbs are low but if you have a slow metabolism and you're adding extra
fat to like mct oil butter keto cookie bombs things like that your body is going to go after
that dietary fat before your own fat so you may want to consider bringing it down to right around
75 grams you don't want to bring it down too low but bring it down a little bit that may help you
and make sure your protein is a moderate amount not a high amount because the extra protein will
definitely turn into glucose and raise the insulin all right number seven the seventh reason why you
may be plateauing you have a deficiency of your microbes okay you have a microbiome deficiency
you don't have enough friendly bacteria now what does this bacteria have to do with weight loss
there's some very interesting studies one study i'm going to put all these studies down below
show that when you consume regular probiotics you will see significantly more weight loss
and you'll see an improved ldl especially the bad ldl it's called the small dense particle size
that actually improves when you take probiotics all right in another study double-blind
randomized control trial showed that there was improved insulin sensitivity
okay because you're improving insulin resistance and as you may know insulin resistance is behind a
slow metabolism so when you add the microbes your gut you actually indirectly improve your insulin
resistance you make insulin more sensitive so the body does not have to produce as much insulin
it also helps regulate your blood sugars and then in the third study there's an improved test
called homa ir which is a test to indicate if you have insulin resistance again so what's happening
the microbiomes eat fiber that then turns into a compound that greatly improves in sun resistance
in your blood sugar so you're indirectly helping yourself lose weight by letting the microbes
do the work if you have enough diversity in your gut you're going to be way better at losing weight
than if you don't and also this is another interesting point when farmers use antibiotics
they can actually fatten their animals so antibiotics make animals get fatter well
if you don't have the microbes in your gut whether you took an antibiotic or not
that could be one reason why it's contributing to your weight gain and if you don't have enough
microbes in your gut a lot of times you'll have inflammatory problems in your gut
that inflammation will totally kill ketosis so again low carb fast longer vitamin d and then
fortify with probiotics and then the next point like i said insulin resistance is greatly improved
when you fortify your gut with probiotics because the microbes eat the fiber which then turns into
something that helps your blood sugars and just so you know good probiotics can actually help
build up your friendly bacteria but fiber okay it's a prebiotic doesn't make new microbes it
actually just feeds the microbes you have the food that your microbes like to eat is fiber and i'm
talking about from non-starchy vegetables i'm not talking about doing the whole grains and the cool
thing about fiber it is the only carbohydrate that has zero influence on insulin so it's good

hi guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the difference
between whole wheat bread and white bread is there a difference well let's first talk about
the glycemic index that's the scale on how fast these foods turn into sugar and raise
your blood Sugar's okay basically they're almost identical there really is no difference they're
both highly glycemic so they actually turn into sugar pretty fast and they also will increase the
bad cholesterol so that's one thing so when people tell you oh yeah half whole-wheat is
gonna it's very low in the glycemic index it's really not it turns into sugar pretty fast the
thing about whole-wheat because it has more stuff in it is less refined sometimes they have to put
more preservatives in there too to make it last longer or mold will set in or bugs will come in
to start to set in there so that's another problem and then also both of these things have gluten and
gluten is the things the protein wheat that really destroys the intestines and gives you all sorts of
types of illnesses like celiac and diverticulitis and Crohn's and all these digestive inflammatory
conditions so gluten is highly inflammatory and it can affect your joints arthritis and
especially your gut right here also whole wheat has a phytic acid phytic acid is a chemical that
prevents the absorption of minerals calcium magnesium potassium iron all these minerals
that are supposedly in that wheat bread it are going to be blocked so if you were going to eat
bread Ezekiel bread is a lot better so that's a sprouted bread so at least that gets rid of
this it has less gluten and it's asking a little lower on the glycemic index even though I don't
recommend it I mean if you're going to have some occasionally it's a lot better Ezekiel bread you
can find it at any grocery store in the frozen section but it's a it's a sprouted bread okay
now as far as the nutritional profile even the whole wheat bread what happens is they grind
it into flour and that flour has to sit on the shelf and within six days you lose a lot of
the nutrition so unless you're going to grind the bread yourself and make the bread chances
are the nutrition profile is not as high as you think all right yeah and as a side note if you

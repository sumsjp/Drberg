today we're going to talk about the relationship between your fat and your
immune system what you need to know is that obesity weakens the immune system
but the question is why and how there's two main types of fat you have the
superficial fat around your body which is the stuff right beneath your skin and
then you have visceral fat that is the fat that's in your midsection that is
spilling off from your liver being fat because there's no place to go so the
fat goes around the organs and sometimes inside the organs with superficial fat
you're going to have more accumulation of B cells which make antibodies and T
cells okay that's part of the thymus so these are two different immune cells but
with the visceral fat you have more natural killer cells and killer T cells
now what does that mean that means you're going to have a lot of these
things right here which cause a lot of inflammation so people that have
visceral fat have more inflammation because they have an overly active
immune system the buffer for this over-reactive immune system the thing
that's supposed to suppress encounter it is called the t regulatory cells and
those are going to be deficient when you have too much visceral fat so what's
making the inflammation is your actual immune system the other thing that's
really bad about having too much visceral fat is the antibodies that you
create against viruses and even bacteria they tend to lose their memory a lot
quicker so they don't remember the infection so you have less fighting
force when you have more visceral fat now this really applies to the COVID-19
situation in that one of the big predisposing factors is being overweight
not to mention the things that go with being overweight high blood pressure
diabetes metabolic syndrome etc so we have very specific types of immune cells
that are being generated by having this type of fat around your midsection
we have deficiency the cells that are supposed to suppress
the inflammation so thereby increasing inflammation inflammation itself weakens
the immune system being overweight weakens the immune system and also the
cascade of inflammation that's generated from these immune cells can create
insulin resistance now in the other videos I talked extensively about
consuming sugar and refined carbs increase insulin resistance consuming
frequent meals increase insulin resistance but I really haven't
mentioned inflammation causing insulin resistance
now if someone's a pre-diabetic this inflammation could be just the thing to
push them over the edge into diabetes because really the difference between a
pre-diabetic situation and diabetes is that insulin resistance suddenly fails
to compensate for insulin and then the shift takes place so let me just kind of
draw this out so you can get this because it's very important you have a
pancreas right here we have the cell right here and we have the hormone right
here so this is insulin pancreas cell and receptor so let me just show you
what insulin resistance is I won't let this insulin into the cell so what's
gonna happen is because we don't get a connection we don't get the feedback
loop to turn off this insulin so it pumps more and more and more to the
point where you have five to seven times the amount of insulin then you should
and all that excess insulin is kind of camouflaging the problem because it's
pushing the blood sugars down because usually the person is consuming a lot of
carbs this inflammation right here can almost act like a carbohydrate and push
us to the extent where your cells and the pancreas gets so tired exhausted
they're done they can't pump out any more insulin
so the insulin starts going down down down because of this so now you have a
situation the cells are burnt plus you have this at the same time
there's nothing there to push the blood Sugar's down so then we go from
pre-diabetes to diabetes and that's really the mechanism so what do you have
to do you have to get on keto do intermittent fasting and as this
visceral fat goes away the inflammation is going to go away and that's going to
improve over time to reverse this thing so I wanted to demonstrate it's not just
the carbs and the frequency of eating it's also the fat and the inflammation
that can cause the problem and this inflammation could also come from other
sources as well omega-3 fatty acids injuries infections like virus
infections chronically anyway there's a lot more to talk about this but I just
wanted to cover this one point thanks for watching
Hey we're back with another amazing
recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to
check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself
it's just so easy to be keto but is it simple it's super simple
we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating

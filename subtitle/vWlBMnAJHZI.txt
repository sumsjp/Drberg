so i'm always reading your comments
getting ideas for videos and someone
mentioned
what to do with an inflamed digestive
tract that's what i'm going to talk
about
the first thing i want to bring up is
what is the function of your digestive
tract
i'm mainly talking about your stomach
your small intestine and the large
intestine
the main function is to break down your
food the macronutrients
carbs proteins and fats and then absorb
the micro nutrients okay pull it in
through the digestive tract
at its smallest level in other words
you're eating protein
but we're absorbing amino acids you're
eating fat
and you're absorbing essential fatty
acids you're eating carbohydrates and
you're extracting the vitamins and
minerals
and then part of the undigested fiber is
taken care of
from your own microbes if you have any
inflammation
in any part of your digestive tract
you're going to have a very difficult
time absorbing okay
there's a condition called malabsorption
that means you're just not getting the
absorption of the nutrients into the
body and that could occur
from inflammation in the lining of your
colon
or scar tissue that was created from the
inflammation so now we have a situation
because we're not going to get the full
absorption of vitamins
minerals essential fatty acids certain
parts of your digestive tract
absorb certain nutrients okay so if we
can identify what part of your
digestive tract is damaged let's say the
the last
part of the ilium that's the last part
of the small intestine
then we know you're not going to be able
to absorb the amino acids as well
or the bile salts so you won't get that
recycling
and chances are you're going to be
deficient in bile which means you'll
probably be deficient in vitamin a
d e and k and also 90
of all your digestion occurs in this
small intestine
okay so if your stomach doesn't have
enough acid or your gallbladder doesn't
have enough bile
or your pancreas is not releasing the
enzymes and you're going to get
something that ferments too much
so you're going to get a lot of bloating
and pain in your small intestine
and so there's a number of things that
create inflammation
it could be from taking antibiotics it
could come from antacids
it could come from pathogens because you
don't have enough
acid in your stomach it could come from
food poisoning
tapeworms gluten grains
omega-6 oils highly inflammatory it
could also come from food allergies
could be from nuts or dairy or it could
be from fiber because there's already
pre-existing damage and it's just
tearing up your colon
so regardless of the cause of
inflammation there's several things that
you can do
number one you may want to go carnivore
for a while because people with gut
issues
do better on carnivore at least for a
couple months okay
they don't do well on a very high fiber
diet unless there's maybe a small amount
of fermented vegetables
or cooked vegetables they can possibly
handle that but depending on the damage
you might not want to add
fiber however this is interesting
normally
wheat has gluten it'll tear up your
stomach
but if you have wheatgrass juice a high
quality i'm talking organic raw
wheatgrass juice or it's powder
that comes without the gluten that comes
without the fiber and that can create
some
major relief in your intestinal tract
especially if there's
any problems with ulcers and
inflammation
or irritation or gastritis because the
wheatgrass
juice powder it's without the fiber it's
not wheatgrass this wheatgrass juice
powder
has a lot of phytonutrients including
chlorophyll that's incredibly healing
for the internal lining of your
digestive tract so if you have any gut
issues or any inflammation that would be
one thing i would highly recommend
i'll put a study down below that was a
pretty hardcore
double-blinded study uh showing some
really good results
okay the next thing you need to do is
fasting okay
definitely regular intermittent fasting
as well as periodic prolonged fasting
that's going to give the digestive tract
a chance to heal you're going to create
a condition called autophagy which is
going to help repair
the lining of your colon very important
vitamin d
at least 20 000 i use because it's a
very powerful
anti-inflammatory and if you have gut
damage
you're going to have a more difficult
time absorbing vitamin d
as well as calcium and then you also
want to replace what's missing let's say
you're low in hydrochloric acid
or you're low in enzymes or you're low
in bile or you're low in your good
bacteria so anyway that's my
recommendation if you have
inflamed digestive tract hey before you
go
if you're benefiting from any of my
content
i would love to hear about your success

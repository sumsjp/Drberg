lycopene what is lycopene lycopene is a phytonutrient maybe you've heard about it in
tomatoes but it's also in grapefruit gogi berries something called gac which is the melon in asia
gak has the most lycopene of anything natural out there it's also an asparagus parsley and basil now
there's a couple things that are interesting about lycopene number one the bioavailability of it
the ability for it to absorb in your body and even be concentrated occurs when you heat the
substance like tomatoes for example so when you consume canned tomatoes or tomato paste
you're going to consume lycopene four times the amount in raw tomatoes and then if you
added olive oil with it you're really going to increase the absorption because lycopene is a fat
soluble phytonutrient which means it requires bile and when you add fat you help the absorption
so let's see what would be a good combination of let's see basil tomato sauce and olive oil
oh that's right spaghetti sauce right but here's what lycopene is good for an enlarged prostate
it can help support blood pressure it can act as a blood thinner it can help in the regulation of
blood lipids like cholesterol it's a very powerful antioxidant it can act as an anti-inflammatory
it helps boost the detoxification enzymes of the liver it has a certain anti-tumor property and
it protects against things like hydrogen peroxide which creates oxidation in the body so in that
case it's acting as an antioxidant all right there we have it the benefits of lycopene hey before

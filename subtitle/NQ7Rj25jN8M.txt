let's talk about the difference between the dead sea salt versus regular sea salt is there a
difference yes there's a huge difference now where do they get these dead sea salts from the dead sea
which is located in a lake that borders jordan israel and the west bank now this is interesting
even though the salt and the dead sea is 10 times more salty it's actually less salty let me explain
it is more concentrated with minerals that's for sure but if we do a comparison to sea salt for
example sea salt is about 90 percent sodium table salt is 98 sodium yet the salt in the dead sea
is only eight percent sodium so it's way less in sodium but it's very high in other minerals yet 60 %
of it is a combination between magnesium and potassium so it's very low in sodium very high
in potassium and magnesium so what does this mean it means that it's not meant to be consumed
it's meant to be applied topically on your body to the surface of your skin whether in a sea salt mud
bath or in your bathtub so if you're going to use the sea salt in your bathtub you just want to add
a half of a cup because it's super concentrated but the salt in the dead sea has some very
interesting therapeutic benefits number one it can decrease skin breakouts as in acne number
two it increases skin hydration it can decrease the aging appearance on your skin it's great for
pain especially if you have rheumatoid arthritis as well as arthritis especially in your knee it
can enhance the healing process of your skin and it's great for fibromyalgia but you don't want to
consume it you want to consume regular sea salt but not the salt from the dead sea so if you're

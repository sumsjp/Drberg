hey guys we're back today we're going to make some hush puppies and when you say
not the shoes the actual food and when you say we I mean you right yeah okay good so yes
so you know when you're on keto there's all these ideas about all the foods you
can't have you've got to sacrifice and you gotta live without well not in the Berg
house okay okay okay house puppies so these are simple and they actually are I
think they're really good well normally hush puppies are made with
corn right let's see what is this made with love okay
Wow you know like about this what salt yes well in the recipe you know I don't
think it says this but at the end i salted the tops of them because we like
sea salt so here's the thing Karen yeah what's the thing salt is important tell
me two things no salt is important you know people
actually I think they're eating chips because of like the salt in it yeah sure
so it's very important to hide the chips if someone is addicted to them Karen
he's a long time ago last week no she would bring sometimes chips for the kids
and stuff and I said hide those damn things because they're so good it's a
salt I need salt I could eat three chips yeah I can eat the whole bag
in a cabinet and then he would say Karen hide those chips because that's how you
talk well in college you know that I used to use the mega bag of
Doritos in one sitting the big bulky bag in one sitting so you know I have weaknesses
the funny thing is that I would hide the chips I would hide them in like the
bathroom cabinet or something and then the next day I would see him with the
chips he's like oh you didn't hide them good enough so no he was digging through
the house this is why it's important especially when you're on
keto to do at least one teaspoon a day of salt because if you don't you're
gonna actually crave chips yeah like I don't know where it is but it's
basically salt actually will prevent keto flu help a weakness fatigue
especially if you get muscle cramps and the flu-like symptoms actually so the other
people crave fat and they use bread to scoop their fat right Karen yes I have
one question burning question what's up how's the hush puppy it was great I'm gonna have another one
okay yeah all right good well let's show you how to make it

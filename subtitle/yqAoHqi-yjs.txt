let's talk about the seven triggers of a headache now what's the difference between a headache
and a migraine headache a migraine headache is more severe it often has other associated symptoms
like nausea blurred vision seeing spots sensitive to bright lights source sounds vomiting or having
some type of aura about 30 minutes before the headache some type of sensation giving you a clue
that there is a migraine coming on but a general headache is a more mild version of a migraine
so number one stress can trigger your headache and that can be from any type of stress but it is the
number one cause of headaches and it tightens up the muscles in the back part of your neck
number two your diet you could have a food allergy and believe it or not that's very very common
especially for headaches that are delayed because let's say for example the food
allergy reaction is occurring lower in your gastrointestinal tract which
takes a few hours to get there and as soon as it hits it it creates a reaction and there are all
sorts of nerves in your gut that send signals right up to the brain through the vagus nerve
so it could be delayed now the typical allergies would be like peanut allergies gluten allergies
the protein in milk called casein and there's thousands of other ones too much caffeine can
trigger a headache uh artificial sweeteners alcohol in the form of something called a hangover
i don't know if you've ever experienced that before maybe you might know of a friend or a
family member a red wine and white wine has sulfates which can then trigger a headache
chocolate has certain compounds that can trigger a headache msg usually in the form of modified food
starch can trigger a headache i know for myself if i notice a headache let's say i'm going to bed and
i'm like why do i have a headache or i'm waking up with a headache i will reflect back on what i ate
and it could be like i went out to a restaurant and they had some hidden chemicals or msg and
i will get a headache cured meats have nitrates which can trigger headaches aged cheeses pickled
foods fermented foods have a certain protein that occurs with aging it's called tyramine and that
can trigger a headache it's in blue cheese it's in feta cheese it's in parmesan cheese
all right number three your environment let's say you have a seasonal allergy which affects
the sinuses that can give you a headache or even a change in weather can give you a headache because
the body is having a hard time adapting and some people even get headaches right before it rains
because the barometric pressure changes number four hormones that time of the month all of a
sudden you get a headache too much estrogen for this you want to take something called dim or
a concentrated cruciferous type product to help lower estrogen you can also take some seek help
as well a lot of the solutions for the things that i talk about i'll put links down below for more
information number five lack of sleep that will definitely create a headache usually tightness
in the spine in your upper back you'll feel like a throbbing sensation if you don't get enough sleep
number six and this is really common a problem with your gallbladder or the liver or the ducts
that drain from the liver to the gallbladder if those ducts become blocked with some sludge
because you don't have enough bile salts that pressure will back up and that will usually cause
headaches on the right side of your head if the headaches are on the left side it could be sludge
blocking some of the ducts in the pancreatic area which is related i'll put two videos down below
for more information on what to do about that but this is very very common now if you have a gut
issue let's say you have some inflammation in the last part of your small intestine
from years of antibiotics or whatever and you eat a certain food what can happen especially
if you have a leaky gut is that by the time that food hits that point in your digestive tract
that can trigger a spasm in your gut which can then make you feel kind of nauseous and
even give you a headache that relates to what i talked about here and so this is why if someone
gets a headache it's very important to ask them what did you eat not necessarily just before you
got the headache but maybe several hours before and you can track it down there's something that
you're eating that's irritating the gut all right and number seven certain medications can give you
headaches now there's something called rebound headaches normally when people take aspirin they
get rid of a headache but sometimes they can actually trigger a headache after it goes away
especially when we're dealing with aspirin acetyl menophane sleeping pills ibuprofen
and so if you're taking some of these for a headache why not find out the root cause of the
headache get that corrected so the need for that becomes a lot less all right thanks for watching

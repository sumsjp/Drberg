hey guys in this video we want to talk
about the best indicator for adrenal
fatigue okay this is what it is it's
tolerance to stress
how much can you tolerate stress okay
do you have a short fuse do you fly off
the handle easily are you easily
irritated
do you have no tolerance for incompetent
people
slow people
stupid people
illogical people
or how about bad spelling
right that's a typo right there
i have people clients that come in that
will see one typo in one of my old books
and just fly off the handle it's
incredible so it's really your ability
to be calm in a stress state your
ability to handle stress really relates
to the strength of the adrenal if you
can handle it you have good adrenals if
you can't
you have bad adrenals now one of my
clients worked for the
she worked arlington cemetery and she
buried 30 people a day
her adrenals were so broken down
that just the slightest little thing if
you pulled in front of her or the car
she would just lose it okay so
that's really what's happening with the
adrenals you lose the ability to handle
life okay the best reaction
is to be in sushi this is a word a
french word that means carefree
relaxed laughing at things versus
serious
people that have adrenal fatigue are
very very serious and they're very solid
they're like a rock
people that are have really good
adrenals are very light
carefree
they have a lot of space around them
so this is just an indicator for the
adrenal what i use to support this
specific
issue is the adrenal and cortisol relief
some of you are already taking this in
the form of adrenal day formula
so i upgraded it
with more ashwagandha and you can take
one or two or three of these and you'll
feel very very chilled out in fact if
your spouse has a low tolerance to
stress or a co-worker just take one
tablet and put it in some coffee when
you serve them coffee and within about
10 minutes they're going to be so
chilled out
so go ahead and try that and let me know
how that works

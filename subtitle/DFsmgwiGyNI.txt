Hey guys in this video we're going to talk about intermittent fasting and
ketosis Q and A there's a lot of little questions I want to create one video to
explain everything so the first question people keep asking is can I chew gum on
a ketogenic diet that's not going to be significant at all it's so small and I
also recommend you do the xylitol gum not the aspartate aspartame type gum
that everyone else does so yes you can do some gum lemon water is that okay
totally fine lemon juice is not a big factor at all
so tart but there's not a lot of sugar wheatgrass juice powder I do wheatgrass
juice powder during the fast not a problem
it's my multi vitamin mineral everything okay
protein powders only with a meal because it's protein so that will spike insulin
especially if it's low fat protein or whey protein you want to add some fat to
it and then also have it after the meal or during the meal but not as a snack a
cheat day well I already have a video on that but no there's no such thing as a
cheat day on my program but because here's the thing when you would do a
cheat day you pretty much are bumped out of this ketosis for a period of time
because it takes a while to get into ketosis it's going to take a while to
get back to ketosis so on some people it's going to take three days to get
back on others it could even take a week I'm not kidding so that could be a long
time so that could explain why you may not be losing weight because you might
be doing a cheat day twice a week nullifying everything it really depends
how much you cheat calories and two meals like how do you fit in all your
calories into two meals or even one meal well there's a kind of a balance you
don't want to stuff yourself to then this huge meal where you're stuffed all
day you want to eat a really good healthy meal make sure the food is
really nutrient dense the kale shakes I always recommend because that has more
nutrition than other types of greens and make sure it's like salmon that's a
higher quality than chicken and then you may have to enhance with certain types
of nutrients but we're not necessarily trying to stuff ourselves we're trying
to have two big meals and just till you're satisfied and
or not the body will adapt to that many calories there's a confusion that people
think that if they have less meals than they're starving and it's going to slow
the metabolism that is not true because you're doing nutrient-dense
meals if you do a small meal and you're still hungry and it's like empty
calories or like five small meals of n2k empty calories with sugar you're
definitely going to create kind of a situation where you're going to be
hungry and craving all the time and your metabolism will slow down simply because
you're cutting the calories that you're covering the nutrients so the real key
is the nutrients so those meals that you consume have to be robust large very
very complete there's I've created other videos just on that one topic okay keto
rash now typically it's either two situations either the liver is dumping
something and usually the reason for that is that you're losing a lot of fat
a lot of the toxins in your body is stored in the fat so a lot of times
those toxins can come out of the fat circulate to the blood to the lymphatic
system and come out as a rash so one thing the combat that is to consume a
large quantity of vegetables make sure that's very high to kind of offset some
of the other fat burning that's occurring but also bentonite clay you
can consume them on an empty stomach bentonite clay is interesting because
it's like a little piece of clay that does adsorption which is kind of like it
absorbs on the outside of the particle 20 no it's 2,000 times its weight so
it's like a very powerful magnet for toxins or a sponge that will pull these
toxins so they don't leach out into the tissues
okay bentonite clay okay apple cider vinegar and lemon drink not a problem on
this on times of fasting go ahead and consume that is not going to be an issue
will my cholesterol go up on some people yes simply because the fat cell is
composed of cholesterol and triglycerides
so your body can only burn the triglycerides it doesn't burn
cholesterol so what happens some people especially losing a lot of weight like
50 or 60 pounds and they have a lot of weight to lose they could have a higher
level of cholesterol but I put a link down below for you to get the complete
scoop on LDL HDL and total cholesterol because you don't really have to worry
about it if you're doing this correctly and you're doing a lot of vegetables
that's just the excess cholesterol coming out of the fat cell that has to
come out has to go to the liver and be dismantled to the gallbladder now the
keto flu or keto fatigue is basically a situation where you're missing you're
depleting potassium and B vitamins so if you were to put those back in either an
electrolyte powder or you can do nutritional yeast that should handle it
like that other things that can happen too which I don't want to get into that
detailed like you could have an issue with more chance for a kidney stone for
example right well potassium citrate will totally handle that and that's
that's only if you're not consuming enough potassium from the vegetables
which I know is not the case because you you know your vegetables do I recommend
either one of these during breastfeeding not really because you don't want to do
a diet or you don't want to try to lose weight when you're breastfeeding you
want to make sure max maximize the the food there and not worry about doing too
much fasting especially since you have a lot of stuff coming out from the fat
cell same thing with pregnancy don't
recommend it just eat really healthy during pregnancy and don't worry about
trying to lose weight or maintain your weight the key thing with pregnancy and
this is the side note is make sure you get take cod liver oil or some grass-fed
liver and I'm going to tell you why because if you consume the right amount
of vitamin A not from a pill but from food you can prevent a lot of issues
with dental arch problems overbite under bite so you want your child to come out
so he or she does not get braces but has good bone structure that's all the fat
soluble vitamins in the trace minerals so make sure you can
trace minerals and fat fiber vitamins I like cod liver oil and sea kelp is a
good one or a plant-based trace minerals okay for kids can kids do this well if a
child is really overweight I probably would put them on this but if they're
not I would put them on a version of this and I actually recommend maybe some
fruit not this the extra sweet stuff but I wouldn't be worried about berries
maybe bananas would be fine but yeah that's maybe eat sweet potatoes
yams would be okay but other than that if their their metabolism is so fast
they're going to need some type of starch we're also going to get really
really skinny okay bulletproof coffee question keeps coming out but sure that
can I do that well some people just have it in the morning to sustain them and
that's not a problem but it is kind of like a meal if you're adding fat or
coconut oil it is considered a meal and it could potentially spike instant a
little bit so my whole point with this is try it out and see if you're happy
with your results with weight loss try it out for a week and then don't try it
for a week and see how it effects your weight some people do really good some
people do not and I'll just make one change maybe I'll cut down the butter
they put in there the coconut and bam they just start really losing weight so
experiment on that but make sure you don't do a lot of coffee simply because
it stimulates the adrenal so 1:00 in the morning would be perfect now start as
milk if you want to put some organic milk just a little bit it's not a big
deal okay kombucha tea if you're going to do kombucha tea for most people it's
fine it does have ranges from two grams of sugar up to like 10 grams of sugar
make sure it has no more than two grams of sugar and make sure that's one
serving size and also that's another one where it could potentially bump you out
of ketosis but it may not so experiment but people that want to a
substitute for alcohol this is what I would recommend drinking a champagne
glass is carbonated has the texture of beer it will relax you but you don't
need much just do a little bit if you do too much it can actually make you even
too acidic and it can throw off your ph where your breathing is awful
little bit to keep you up at night okay a lot of information just wanted to
cover these questions and let me know what you think below put your comments
thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz
down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root
cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause
so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report

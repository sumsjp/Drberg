hey it's Dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the amazing
gallbladder part 3 in part 1 we talked about the function of the gallbladder
and it releases bile to help you break down fats in part two we talked about
referred pain in all the different pain sources it can go to that are up in the
right shoulder blade and neck and area right here and then now in part three
we're going to talk about some additional important functions that you
need to know the other thing that I wanted to mention is that one of the
triggers for production of bile is to have a very strong acid in your stomach
if you know anything about pH when the pH goes down that's more that's more
acid if it goes up it's less acid and so if you go from a pH between 1 and 3
that's like battery acid it's so strong and that is the acid that you need in
your stomach when the acid starts going up to high then like a 4 or 5 you're not
going to be able to release the bile from this and the way that you're going
to know that you lose your stomach acids is the valve on top of the stomach that
keeps the acid into the stomach will start opening up they call that GERD so
GERD really or acid reflux is low stomach acids not high stomach acids and
those low stomach acids are not able to trigger the closure of that valve and
that in the acid reflux will splash up into the esophagus so so if you if you
have acid reflux or GERD then we know you're not going to have enough bile
okay so that's just an indication to a clue to be able to kind of think with
this system and how it works they're both connected so you want to understand
the whole situation and just in the side note one of the most common reasons why
people don't have enough stomach acid is they're on low sodium diets so when you
or salt diets sodium chloride chloride helps break up to make hydrochloric acid
and if you don't have enough salt like people are having a low salt diet you
start your pH becomes more alkaline and you have a lot of digestive problems so
that's as side note okay now if this bile is in
sufficient amounts you'll be able to absorb vitamin A and but if you don't
have enough bile your vitamin A deficiency will manifest as night
blindness can't see in the dark it's difficult to see when the headlights are
shining in your eye also your skin will be dry you'll have all sorts of problems
with your skin little lose little bumps all over the place and also the lining
of your skin on the inside of your sinuses and your throat will be affected
so laryngitis sinusitis anything internal the lining on the inside of
your body is controlled by vitamin A so here you are taking all this vitamin A
but it's not working because you don't have enough bile right you may see
because bile is recycled you may not have enough because it's not being
recycled or it's just not being produced and so I always recommend to take some
purified bile salts to be able to see if that helps you and if it does then we
know we can start to improve the your own body's production but it's a real
simple inexpensive way to test to see if that is your problem okay and again I'm
not diagnosing any diseases here these this is just stuff to think with so you
and your doctor can work together and give them other solutions other than
removing this thing okay so we've added vitamin A also if
you're low in vitamin A you're going to get acne I mean take a look at Accutane
what does that contain that's for acne what is it it's concentrated vitamin A
but it's in a toxic amount that's why there's a lot of side effects so if you
have enough vitamin A because you have enough bile you're probably not
going to get acne okay vitamin D is vitamin D important oh my goodness
vitamin D basically controls the absorption of calcium and so if you
can't absorb calcium you have all sorts of issues calcium is not just bone
building but it has to do with muscle and heart contraction it has to do with
cellular communication it has to do with improving the immune system it has a lot
to do with a lot of different functions because it's the main mineral that helps
communication between the cells it actually carries hormones between cells
so vitamin D is very important and so people a lot of times are so low vitamin
D levels but it's not because they're not consuming food with vitamin D it's
because they don't have enough power to absorb it yeah so so how do you know if
you don't have enough bile well just go down the list do I have bloating burping belching
constipation do I have right shoulder pain these are just you know classic symptoms
of low bile ok vitamin D now we have vitamin k2 this is a really important
vitamin I talked about in some of the other videos but vitamin k2 is different
than vitamin k1 vitamin k2 is a calcium transporter it basically keeps the
calcium out of the soft tissues now if you look at a lot of health conditions
whether you're getting older and you're getting stiffer you're getting arthritis
hardening of the arteries it's going to cause high blood pressure strokes
because there's calcium plaquing in the brain
cataracts on the eye that's calcium in the eye kidney stones gallstones
spurring all this extra calcium in the soft tissues that is because you don't
have enough vitamin K that's why and so if you're taking vitamin K and you don't
see improvement in this calcium issue it's because you probably don't
have enough bile so you have to think of the things the cascade effect that can
happen you have to think backwards and see what's before vitamin K2 vitamin
k2 is in all the grass fed animal products like grass-fed butter grass-fed
beef you know that type of thing it's in a lot of the things that people are
telling you to avoid they say avoid fat well you need vitamin k2 I take it as a
supplement because I I have a lot of soft tissue calcium because of my old
injuries and the spurring in my back that I had so I'm using that to help
clean that up the k2 is really important in a lot of
conditions especially if your body's getting stiff and it's turning into a
stone but again we want to make sure we have enough bilel so soft tissue calcium
issues can be caused by lack of bile all right so that's part three I'll see
you in a part 4

so this video will want to analyze a typical day of food for an average
person so for breakfast they had to eggs toast avocado half avocado for lunch
they went out to a lunch in the hand of salad a fish and bread that they bring
on the table right dinner chicken soup this was at home this was canned okay
and then for snacks they had a piece of chocolate and corn chips because they
create a little salt salt and chocolate it's right there that tells me their
adrenal so the first thing I'm going to look at is I'm going to look at why this
person cannot lose weight from the fat burning hormones so we know right here
fat burning occurs with triggering with we need consuming protein so that was
really good avocado is a fat but it's very neutral
it will it will actually help you burn fat because a healthy type of fat plus
it's very satisfying but the toast is going to block that fat
burning for that meal salad fish okay that's good but of course they add the
bread in there all it takes is a little bit of carbohydrate to throw off of that
burning chicken soup most of the chicken soup out there that you buy from the
grocery store has msg hidden is modified food starch that will stimulate insulin
by 300% blocking all chances of losing weight so this might be a big problem
chocolate most chocolat has sugar in it again but even if it doesn't a little
bit of caffeine is not good to consume at night because that can keep you up
but chocolate contains not necessary caffeine but a chemical that it mimics
caffeine so I don't want to get into exactly in the details in that but it
can act like caffeine and then of course corn chips are a carbohydrate right
through in here that might be a problem because it's turning into sugar very
easily now if we analyze it through the nutrients this is good avocado has
basically the highest amount of potassium you can consumed
it's very nutrient dense eggs are almost a perfect nutrient food so that's good
toast doesn't have a lot of nutrition salad I would like to know the quantity
of salad that that person consumed was it a lot was it a little it needs to
be during the day probably about seven to possibly ten cups of salad so this is
a side salad it wouldn't provide any nutrients at all so we got so we got to
consume this isn't a can there's not a lot of nutrition in canned foods so
right off the bat this person does not have enough nutrition to satisfy the
requirements that we need cravings this person I can see craves chocolate in
salt late at night because their breakfast is not it's as it's allowing
carbohydrates right here if you want to prevent cravings at night it's important
to have a book big huge solid breakfast that has eggs protein and fat not
necessarily any carbohydrates this is the secret to preventing cravings at
night okay so if you consume too many carbohydrates or even like go at the
IHOP and consume all that stuff you're gonna crave a night big time okay so met
cravings estrogen that would be like soy I don't see any soy in here I don't
necessarily know if a lot of these foods are organic or have hormones in them
they may like if it's Pharma fed fish or if the eggs were not you know grass-fed
I doubt it so that could consume some type of
estrogenic type effects gluten could be in the toast bread and that will affect
the digestion so they may feel bloated for the day and giving a lot of symptoms
from gluten which would be irritable digestive issues and even arthritic
symptoms possibly GMO that is genetically modified foods if we scan
the list the big thing that jumps out as the corn chips right now almost all corn
soy and canola is all genetically modified so that's a big huge problem
that a lot of people that are consuming unknowingly the corn is a top one so if
you're going to do corn chips which I don't even recommend make sure it's
organic or GMO free okay so they've got GMO organic I don't know if any of this
is or ganic the benefit is then it's a little
bit healthier nutrition wise and has less hormones and chemicals and then for
your body type that's a whole other layer of thing that we can look at
because some body types need more of this or more of that so I just wanted to
kind of quickly scan to give you some tips that when we look at a daily food
plan we want to dissect from the viewpoint of are you able to burn fat do
you have enough nutrition are we preventing cravings is it aligned with
your body type I'll be doing monthly seminars for the people that come to my
website and I'm gonna be analyzing your daily meal plans so we can really
educate you on what to eat to maximize health and minimize the damage okay so
this is a little bit of an introduction I'll see you in the next video

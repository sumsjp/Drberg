hey it's me again in this video we're going to talk about why you really can't
lose weight this is a very fundamental important video for those people are
struggling losing stubborn resistant weight okay so if you have any problem
if you're menopausal and you can't lose weight this is very very important the
first thing you can know is that the reason why most people can't lose weight
is that losing weight goes against the basic purpose of the body the purpose of
the body is to survive okay so anytime this survival purpose is
threatened by starvation that's a low-calorie diet by eating low-fat that
is a threatened survival because fat is necessary to rebuild your brain nerves
every cell in the body so when you start creating scarcity your body will hold on
the fat tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter until nothing
comes off so anything that threatens the survival stress is going to cause the
fat not to leave because the purpose of the fat the purpose of the body is to
survive and thrive so the way to lose weight is not to starve the body or
overtrain it or be exhausted so that's one thing when the body when you try to
lose weight which I think we should clarify this I think you want to lose
actual fat right so let's just focus on that because there's the purpose of fat
is to prevent starvation from sugar okay so that's the this is the primary fuel
source so fat is used as a backup organ so in case the sugar runs out this acts
as a backup a lot of times though when you're in a survival state where your
body's threatened you're like a stress State the body will definitely break
down protein to for fuel and you see that as something called atrophy and
that's the shrinkage of your muscles primarily in the thighs but it
could be in the but it can be in the arms and this loss of protein is that is a method
of your adrenals breaking down the protein for fuel even before the fats
broken down because it considers fat as the last-ditch effort to be able to
survive so that's one thing we'll come back to that in second but the main
purpose is to prevent the starvation of sugar okay
because sugar you'll you have about I don't know 72 hours of sugar storage in your
body before you run out and then you would die unless you had a backup fuel
source okay so now if we understand that the purpose of the body is to survive then
why would we do a diet why would we starve it why would we over train it
doesn't make sense what we want to do is we want to do the opposite of survival
and that would be focused on creating health and pulling the person out of
that state of stress state which is survival state the first thing we have
to do is we do have to starve the body of sugar
oh so that's a given we don't want to not give the body healthy fats we need
to increase that because your body will hold on to this tighter and tighter if
you create fat as a scarcity in the diet so if you don't eat fats this will hold
on a tighter because it's not going to let this go unless it feels like you can
let something go it's kind of like if you were to I don't know go to Las Vegas
and and you're gambling you lose all your money have one down the left you're
going to hold on to that dollar very tight because money is scarce so
anything scarce and you might say I have a lot of extra fat on my body but it's
scarce in the diet so you're not bringing it into the diet
so that's scarce the body is going to hold on to the fat thatit has it would much
rather burn the sugar so so we don't want to cut calories we don't want to
deprive the body we don't want to be hungry we don't want to be stressed and
then as we get better you have to realize that
in the healing process the first thing the body will make sure is those
proteins are intact it will always heal the body it will heal the proteins
before you lose weight and that's why when you do it like a body test it could
be for an after body composition test I can look at the amount of muscle protein
that muscle density that the person is gaining versus weight loss and a lot of
women especially in the beginning especially if their menopause they won't
lose weight initially but they'll regain their muscle back that is a really good
indication that it's working and then if they were to quit too soon that would be
a big mistake so weight loss is not always the goal
the goal is survival so the indications of surviving would be endurance strength
tone better muscle density better energy less stress that's what we're looking
for to know that it's working so I really want you to just to take take
this whole model of weight loss and throw it in the trash we can just pull
you out of survival mode and understand that the body won't let this go unless
it's in a relaxed state and rebuilding is up then it's going to be very
frustrating to you because if you don't lose weight you'll quit and go on to the
next unhealthy thing you'll get desperate and that's the worst thing
because the more desperate you are the more stress that comes in and you're
worried about it so we really have to have a relaxed attitude towards weight
and just have the confidence to know it's going to work but the indication is
you must regain that muscle protein and the question is how long does it take to
regain the muscle protein it doesn't take it's not going to just take one day
it's going to take weeks it could even take a few months to to heal the muscles
before those muscles are healthy enough and efficient enough to actually
metabolize fat so I just wanted to indicate that because this is the new
model that goes beyond just losing weight and it's all about them
understanding the main purpose of your body so I hope that helped we'll see you in
the next video

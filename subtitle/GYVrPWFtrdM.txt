let's talk about the benefits of eucalyptus okay for your sinuses for your lungs it has some really
interesting effects and the primary phytonutrient in this plant that's doing all these great things
is called eucalyptol and you may even be able to get it as a purified chemical but having it
in this full complex with everything in it i think is going to work a little bit better so what does
it do well it actually number one it relaxes the lung tissue so if there's a spasm going on
if there's constriction if you can't breathe it opens up and vasodilates your lung tissue
it also thins the mucus okay so allow mucus to come out of your lungs or out of the sinuses
which is great it has very strong antimicrobial properties so it can inhibit things like tb
mrsa viruses candida and bacteria it's like a natural antibiotic
it also can help suppress a cough so if you have chronic coughing especially at night
this would be really really great to either take or put in a neti pot or even in a hot bath as an
oil but the biggest thing that it does is it suppresses cytokines what are cytokines well
the simple version is this there are things that can cause inflammation and swelling and pain
so when you breathe in eucalyptus or you take it as a supplement it can actually act to block
pain it can reduce inflammation and it can reduce swelling and edema so it's also good for arthritis
and anything related to lung whether it's asthma pneumonia bronchitis so you can look at eucalyptus
as something that's a broad spectrum remedy and it has been thoroughly studied
as effective it's very safe as well hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how

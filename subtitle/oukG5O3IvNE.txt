hi guys I'm back with a very exciting topic today we're going to talk about
using forest bathing to boost your immune system now this was used in Japan
in the 80s for physical and mental health this is not about just actually taking a
bath in nature it's about getting out in nature and breathing in or taking in the
forest atmosphere so there's three interesting studies I want to just talk
about briefly and they're out of Japan and they relate to being out the forest
being exposed to native evergreens like the spruce and pine and other evergreen
trees so this is the essence of forest bathing you're out in the forest and
you're breathing in certain chemicals from these trees there are essential
oils they isolated this really interesting immune benefit from being
exposed to certain essential oils that are actually being emitted from the
trees in the forest so that group of compounds is phytoncides now there's
many different individual chemicals in this category but here's what they found
this chemical significantly increases your natural killer cells now the
natural killer cells are part of the immune system under the innate section
the innate category of the immune system is something you're born with these
white blood cells don't have to be trained they just know what to do and
natural killer cells do a several things one thing is they will punch a hole into
cells that have been infected by viruses and caused the cell to commit suicide so
they destroy not just a cell but the virus inside it and they have certain
chemical weapons that they use there's actually three studies and I put the
links down below the first study was in 2006 it was performed in a small group
of people for three days and two nights that went into the forest and they did
before and after testing and they found significant increase in the number of
killer T cells as well as a significant spike in this compound the next study
was done in 2008 for three days and then they compared that to people that were
in the city that actually went out for a and they spend time relaxing they just
wanted to differentiate is it something in the forest or is it just about going
for a walk okay and they found people in the forest that did the to our walks had
significant increase but not only do they find a spike in killer T cells but
also in the weapon tree that that cell uses to annihilate virus infected cells
now in the last study which was done in 2009 this was done in a hotel room and
what they did is they infused this essential oil with this chemical
throughout the air and guess what they found
they found significant increases in natural killer cells and the weapon tree
that they use in addition to that they also check their adrenaline levels and
they found that their adrenaline was decrease so not only did they have the
immune benefit but they had the stress reduction benefit at the same time and
one last thing I wanted to show you okay these are two groups the forest group
and the city group and these are all the essential oils that are being admitted
from the trees in summary I want to emphasize again and I've done this in
several videos the great importance of strengthening your immune system and
here's a real natural inexpensive way to do it to stimulate your natural killer
cells and the weapon tree they use to kill off viruses getting out in nature
spending some time walking in the woods being exposed to all these amazing
things that are emitted from these trees and one last interesting thing I want to
make note of is that the effects that were created in the body lasted for at
least a couple weeks once you're out of lockdown hopefully very soon you can get
out in the woods be exposed to these trees and really receive the benefit the
immune benefits that you can get from being out in nature

so what is the most common cause of hair loss well if you guessed androgenic alopecia you are correct
now what is androgenic alopecia well it's pattern hair loss now in men it's the receding hairline
and also loss of hair on the top of your head now in women it's a little bit different it's
a kind of a diffuse thinning of the hair all over now this is actually very very common
it affects 50 to 80 percent of men and 25 to 50 percent of females at some point in their lives
now the way hair loss medication works there's a couple different mechanisms one popular drug
works by increasing oxygen nutrients and nitric oxide to the scalp which increases circulation
but most hair loss medications work by inhibiting a certain enzyme and that enzyme is called 5-alpha
reductase now what does this enzyme do well it allows testosterone to be converted to a much more
powerful form of testosterone called dht if you have too much dht in your body what happens
is you get a thickened dermis around the hair follicles so it's going to suffocate the hair
follicle you get increased fibrosis that's kind of like a scarring which wraps around the hair
and then you also get calcification around the hair follicles so that's what dht does
to your hair so dht is a type of androgen what's ironic about androgens in general
is they normally increase body hair but then not on the top of your scalp
they actually you get a loss of hair on the top of your scalp which is pretty odd now let
me just explain more about this enzyme five alpha reductase now when someone experiences castration
there's a 95 percent decrease in androgens and what happens at the same time is they stop
losing their hair they stop experiencing androgenic alopecia another point i want
to bring up is people who are balding nearly always have an increase of dht in their scalp and
people who are deficient in this enzyme 5 alpha reductase do not develop hair loss so apparently
this enzyme is a key factor if you're going to develop hair loss or not my question is what
increases this enzyme and if you guessed insulin you guessed correct because insulin resistance
hyperinsulinemia which is too much insulin and other conditions that have too much insulin like
pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome like obesity like metabolic syndrome are all associated
with androgenic alopecia also low progesterone can increase this enzyme as well and where do
you see low progesterone in menopausal women so based on the data what do you think you should do
get in a low carb diet start doing intermittent fasting now there are natural things you can
take to inhibit this enzyme as well because the problem with taking a drug to inhibit this enzyme
is there's side effects with natural remedies there are less side effects the big one is
salt palmetto that is a great inhibitor of this enzyme zinc can inhibit this enzyme dha which
is an omega-3 fatty acid can inhibit this enzyme and gla which is another specific type of fat can
help you inhibit this enzyme all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video so

so recently someone had a question what have I been eating lately and what is my
intermittent fasting routine so I want to talk about that in this video I have
some other videos and you're gonna find it's very similar to the last video so I
I'm not changing very often I just I can pretty much eat the same thing every
single day Karen cannot just she has to vary it up
so this is what I do in the morning five o'clock I get up I go to bed at 10:30
doing this in a minute fasting I need less sleep okay so I do my coffee
organic and sometimes I use half and half but I prefer to use heavy cream
okay and it's grass-fed and then I do one packet of xylitol now the amount of
coffee I drink is a very small cup okay because I abused myself in college I
used to drink pots of coffee and I burn up madrina 'ls so I no longer do that I
just have one small cup and I'm good for the whole day so I'll do that at 5 at 6
I will get some water with lemon usually I'll do 1 to 2 ounces of organic lemon
juice sometimes they'll use real lemons and I'll have like maybe I number 12 the
16 ounces of water and that's when I take my vitamins okay so that's at 6 and
then I'm not gonna eat until between 1 and 3 o'clock now I am absolutely not
hungry at this point of the day if I had my way
I would actually just do one meal a day all that right but I don't because I
lose too much weight I'm six-two I weigh 180 pounds if I do one meal a day I will
get down to like 177 and I don't like that so I like 180 I feel comfortable
with that and but it's very difficult to consume
that many calories because I would have to consume them like I don't know 3,000
to 3,500 calories in one meal and that's really really tough so I'll break it up
between two meals so the first meal is between 1 and 3 maybe 2 o'clock on
average okay so and the first meal I'll do my 4 eggs they're pasture raised
organic eggs ok when you see free-range it doesn't mean anything or it says with
vegetarian feed that they're doing you know like GMO grains
you want organic and you want pasture-raised okay and I normally try
to get these at the farmers market okay four ounces of bacon and it's not the
type of bacon you might think I get it from the farmers market or I will get it
at a healthy store and it's going to be organic so how much is four ounces if
you take one of those packs and you cut it in half that's how much I consume
some people think I have a pound of bacon a day I don't so it's four ounces
it's not that much and believe it or not bacon is not as fat as you think because
all the fat gets fried off so it's there's a lot of other meats that are a
lot fatter than bacon I just like bacon my body likes it it has a lot of b1 you
don't have to do bacon that's just what I do okay three ounces of cheese I
really like the sheep cheese or goat cheese I'll cut it up in small pieces
and I will fry the eggs and I'll put the cheese on top and then what I'll do is
I'll flip it over easy and then I'll put the bacon on top of that note the cheese
I usually do European cheese high-quality organic grass-fed cheese
1/4 cup olives that's in my egg mixture and maybe one tomato so that's pretty
much for my first meal so you can see it's mostly protein and fat now between
5 & 6 I'll have the second meal now at this
point I am absolutely not hungry because I just ate a few hours ago but I'm
trying to keep my meals within a four maybe three to four hour window so I can
have 20 or 21 hours of fasting that's what I want to do okay
so between 5 & 6 I'll have my second meal I'll start with a huge salad
between 7 to 10 cups I don't do spinach okay I will do
lettuce leap type salad from the health food store or the Farmers Market and
I'll usually cut a bell pepper I'll do some tomato
maybe cabbage maybe kale and I'll cut it up put it in my salad and I also put
some Parmesan cheese on the salad I use olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette okay
because it's almost impossible to find a good dress
at the grocery store so I'll do the salad take my time to eat that and I
will then have my protein okay on average 7 ounces I'll do sardines okay
there with the bones and with the skin you get more nutrients from that
especially calcium and more omega-3 fatty acids I made you the burger and of
course it's high-quality its grass-fed organic okay
I like doing salmon a lot so it's wild-caught I'll do shrimp I'll do hot
dogs not the regular hot dogs that you might think I will get them at the
farmers market and they're grass-fed and they're very healthy and then sometimes
I'll do a steak okay so that's pretty much what I will consume for my protein
if I'm doing a burger or hot dogs I will add mustard to that not ketchup and
sometimes I'll add some fermented vegetables like sauerkraut something
like that then I'll have some nuts pecans or pistachios so I'm very
consistent I can do this my body runs on it and I'm not going to eat anything
from that point on until the next day all right guys so there you have it very
boring that's what I eat in a nut shell no pun intended

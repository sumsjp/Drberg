in this video we're gonna discuss the relationship between your own immune
system and the Game of Thrones it's very similar in that there's this game going
on between your own white blood cells or leukocytes and pathogens viruses
bacteria fungus mold pathogens are those microbes that cause disease and there's
another part of your immune system that I want to discuss a very very long time
ago there is a union created between your
own cells and bacteria and they formed a mutually beneficial relationship
and we now call that bacteria friendly bacteria they have become a big part of
our immune system in helping defend against the unfriendly bacteria and
other pathogens so in this video I want to take clips out of the game of Thrones
and help you understand the immune system the Nights Watch is a military
order dedicated to holding the wall the immense fortification of the northern
border of the seven kingdoms led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont any enemy trying
to invade the seven kingdoms beyond the wall will have to get past the guards
the Nights Watch they are always undo T to protect the
realms of men from whatever is out there the exact same thing happens in your
body you have guards that monitor the wall 24/7 they're called macrophages and
they're large cells that eat the viruses bacteria and they monitor and guard the
wall and in your body you have the external skin and internal skin lining
all the internal skin that lines your nose your lungs your throat and your
gastrointestinal tract are so large it would cover four hundred square meters
the size of two tennis courts so these macrophages have a tremendous
job in protecting against invading pathogens in this next example we have
John Snow becoming the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch which rules over
everyone there and as time goes on he rises up to become the king of the north
and of course the goal of as enemies is to take him out taking out
the commander or the king is a very successful strategy to win the war so in
the body we have certain t-cells okay this stands for thymus the thymus is the
gland that helps train your white blood cells to help defend against pathogens
now the two parts of the immune system are the innate and the acquired the
innate is a part of the immune system that you're born with the acquired is a
part of the immune system that needs training you need the expose your immune
system to germs in microbes and allow the infection to occur to overcome it so
it becomes stronger so you develop your immunity from experience but there's one
central white blood cell that is the commander or the coordinator for the
entire immune system and it's called the T helper cell this is the boss that
coordinates the attack it judges on how many web blood cell the body needs to
create how much weapon tree what type of weapon tree so that your immune system
can be successful now on the other side of the game we have certain pathogens
viruses specifically the HIV virus that has its own strategy of taking out the
head commander of the entire organization so this virus goes after
the T helper cells and destroys the cell and that's its strategy to winning the
war in the final battle for King's Landing Denarius targaryen instructs her
dragon to not just kill specific enemies but to destroy the entire city killing
off not just the enemies but the good people as well creating massive
collateral damage now in the immune system you have something called the T
regulatory cell it has two main functions one is to determine the good
guys from the bad guys to prevent traitors and rogue elements
to invade the body but it also has a very important function that relates to
the example you saw in regulating the attack or a weapon tree that our immune
system releases so you can think of the T regulatory cells as the water that
puts out the fire or the inflammation in the body and if
we don't have these cells in place we can't put up the fire and we get this
massive inflammatory condition that creates a lot of collateral damage now
any time a person tries to enter a city or a wall the guards have to determine
who that person is are they a friendly person or an enemy so this is a very
important job and there's all sorts of mechanisms in place to be able to
differentiate who's good who's bad and to allow only the friendly cells to
invade the body and kill any of the pathogens now as time goes on John Snow
through experience becomes more and more knowledgeable about how to kill his
enemies specifically the White Walkers
he learns about their strengths and their weaknesses and one weakness that
have is dragonglass which is then used as one of the weapons to fight them now
in the immune system and I'm talking about the acquired immune system that
learns from experience we have the B cell B stands for a bone marrow because
that's where it originates from so we have the cell that releases antibodies
so when we're exposed to germs these antibodies interact with the germs and
create memories so the next time when they're in a battle they're exposed to a
specific pathogen they have this memory and they know what to do so in other
words your body develops antibodies over time to deal with specific germs and so
now they are prepared and they will bind with viruses and bacteria and neutralize
them before they can invade the South so little finger in secret makes a deal
with the city logic compass the city watch is yours good and this deal
relates to turning against Ned Stark we stand behind you load stuff so later
when Ned Stark gives an order the gold cloaks turn against Ned and end up
killing all of his soldiers and so the city watch becomes traitors
I did warn you not to trust me now the immune system we have a very similar
thing happening certain mechanisms involving viruses caused our own body to
create what's called Auto antibodies which are antibodies against her own
tissue you can look at this as friendly fire or a part of your own cells
becoming traitors and attacking its own tissue so you see this a lot in
autoimmune disease and many times an autoimmune condition is triggered by a
virus one of the scariest abilities the white walkers have is the power to
create creatures known as whites whites are reanimated corpses which continue to
live as zombies who are under control of the white walkers
so when we're talking about normal cells they have a certain limit to how long
they can live so it could be months it could be a couple years but eventually
these cells die but what happens when normal cells become damaged certain
cells switch over to cancer cells and the way they do that is through a
certain adaptation mechanism which their metabolism has actually changed to a
completely different way of burning fuel and the other very unique thing about
cancer cells is they lose their ability to die and they become immortal just
like the zombies that you just saw so cancer cells are zombie cells that are
no longer under your own body's control and they pretty much have their own
brain where they can take over they invade different areas of inflammation
and they can potentially kill you just like the white walkers
normally in the immune system you have the natural killer cell over here on the
na part of the immune system and then on the acquired you have the T killer cells
that are specialist in attacking cancer cells this game or battle has been going
on for a very long time the goal of our immune system is to kill the cancer
cells and the cancer cells also have a goal of surviving and they can survive
under various conditions they can survive under conditions where there's
no oxygen and sometimes they go into dormancy and come back out of remission
even after chemotherapy so we have tried many things to try to kill off cancer
but our best strategy is really to take care of our own immune system and make
sure the natural killer cells and the t-cells are strong enough to prevent
cancer from growing in the first place and then we had the red woman who is
part of the fiery hand who uses the weapon of fire not to mention the
pyromancers who specialized in fire and then we have individuals that use poison
as their weapon as in the red Viper now in the immune system we have a very
similar situation there's a lot of inflammation which we could look at is
fire which makes it very very hard for a pathogen to live and certain immune
cells use these inflammatory type cytokines in their defense mechanism as
well as using other poisons like bleach and hydrogen peroxide and another one
called interferon which is a chemical that interferes with the viral
reproduction so in the Battle of Blackwater a certain weapon was used to
destroy the ship's to weaken their defenses
now an immune system exact same thing happens you have viruses you have
bacteria you have other microbes that literally have this strategy of turning
down your receptors for vitamin D vitamin D is essential for your immune
system to work but not if it's turned off
they also deplete your zinc which is also essential and your vitamin C so
without these key nutrients your immune system is susceptible it's a vulnerable
to continued infection the faceless men can use the faces of people they kill to
infiltrate the enemy and kill who they need to quietly Arya Stark learns this
technique and puts it to good use
now similar thing happens in the immune system so certain viruses and other
microbes like mycoplasma nano bacteria have various strategies
one of the strategies clean virus might use is to act as one of her own and be
camouflage as one of our own cells so they can go undetected and enter the
cell and create havoc other strategies that nano bacteria use which are very
very small bacteria is to literally build a shell a calcium shell around
them sort of like an igloo or like a little dome that they hide in and be
protected another name for that is a biofilm so the immune system is a real
hard time finding these microbes so the goal of any front line of defense is to
hold the fort when Tyrion Lannister was fighting Stannis Baratheon at the Battle
of the Blackwater Tyrion was about to lose the battle until the reinforcements
finally arrived the battle is over where you have one so you can look at it
like this the in a part of the immune system is the first line of defense the
acquired another name would be adaptive is the second line of defense which
normally takes between five and seven days so in this next scene we have Sansa
Stark who finally identifies Littlefinger's true motive with the help
of her brother bran Stark to finally figure out who is the real instigator
behind so many situations so in the immune system we have a similar thing
immune cells work together so on the acquire side of the immune system we
have the t killer cells which are the assassins like the special forces that
do the killing okay and then you have the B cells which make antibodies B
cells don't necessarily kill the enemy they identify or tag the enemy so here's
a virus they put a little flag in there kill me so then the t killer cell can
find the enemy and kill it alright guys so there you have it the comparison of
Game of Thrones to the game of your own immune system between the Battle of
pathogens and white blood cells thanks for watching

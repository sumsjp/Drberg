let's talk about the most important vitamin for the heart it's vitamin e
the vitamin e that i would recommend is called tocotrienols as compared to tocopherols
there's different type of tocotrienols like alpha beta delta
and then you have different tocopherols too which is alpha beta delta but the primary
and i believe the most important part of the vitamin e complex would involve these okay so
not tocopherols yet tocopherols will help you and so i'm not saying don't consume those but if you
had a choice this is way better it works faster and it's deeper it's a more powerful antioxidant
what food has the most vitamin e wheat germ okay where does wheat germ come in wheat as in wheat
flour that makes bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes things like that
of course vitamin e is already oxidized in these foods so when you consume these foods
you're not going to get any vitamin e in fact it's going to deplete you of vitamin e
so consuming flour products okay because they're you take this grain that has a vitamin e and you
grind it up and you expose it to air you oxidize it right and then you heat it you destroy the
vitamin e vitamin e is very sensitive to heat and oxygen so when you consume the flour products you
can create a deficiency of vitamin e and create problems with the heart probably the next most
damaging thing to the heart is emotional stress and you've heard of that before where emotional
stress can break your heart right especially if it's chronic stress but as far as the heart goes
if you're deficient in vitamin e you your risk for getting angina goes up you need vitamin e to help
keep the oxygen very high in the heart and without vitamin e the heart tends to cramp and you can
experience chest pain and taking vitamin e can greatly reduce chest pain and increase the oxygen
carrying capacity in the lungs because vitamin e is an antioxidant okay and then you have oxidation
in general vitamin e counters that so reduces damage from oxidation whether that's from stress
or these right here or sugar or whatever vitamin e is also good to help regulate blood pressure
if you're low in vitamin e your blood pressure can go up affecting the heart now this one is
probably the most significant the coronary artery which is the main blood supply to the heart
the inside of that artery has a special layer of cells which become inflamed when you're deficient
in vitamin e vitamin e is normally supposed to be in there to protect that artery from
becoming inflamed so if you're deficient in vitamin e we don't have any protection
so if you're consuming these foods for example or going through stress you get the oxidation you
get inflammation then comes the band-aid to put out the fire cholesterol as a band-aid with some
calcium plaquing and fibrous tissue so you have this plaquing going on and hardening of the arteries
and you can even develop clots now vitamin e typically thins the blood preventing clots
so it also helps to decrease the risk of stroke it also can help reduce the risk of atrial
fibrillation so it helps the rhythm of the heart so you can see it's very evident that vitamin e
has very wide spectrum benefits and so keep your carbs low avoid flour products and sugar
try to maintain low stress and if you need to take some vitamin e this is the version i would take i
don't have any brand recommendations but you'll have to just do your own research to pick the
the brand that makes the most sense to you hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

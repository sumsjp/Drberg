hey guys in this video we're going to talk about proteins part three in the
series okay in this discussion we'll talk about lean proteins versus fatty
proteins now if you've never heard this before
heard me talk about it click the video below watch that first because this goes
against exactly what you've been taught your whole life that you have to consume
low fat lean proteins right you go to the store and what do you see you see
low fat yogurt you have to low-fat cheese right low fat milk well what
happens on the insulin scale there's a there's such a thing like an insulin
index those are all the relative foods that will influence insulin that aren't
necessarily carbohydrates okay so the goal is to avoid triggering insulin why
because insulin raises the chance of getting fat insulin increases the risk
of getting diabetes and it creates a lot of other issues but here's the thing low
on this influence scale is fatty foods okay so the more fat the protein is or
the more fat that you consume it's lower on the scale than the leaner type
proteins like what's the the most lean protein you could imagine would be like
a whey protein powder right well that's very very high in the insulin scale that
will spike insulin way more than butter of course people trying to lose weight
would avoid calories for butter but what they're doing they don't realize that's
a neutral with insulin doesn't trigger insulin so it's not necessarily the low
calories that causes weight loss it's the low insulin that creates weight loss
okay so this is a kind of a new thing for a lot of people let's just take an
egg our egg beaters which which is basically egg whites if you just heat
the egg white that stimulates insulin more than if you eat the whole egg or
the egg yolk because we need the fat in it right so what am I saying I'm saying
that when you consume protein okay don't go for the lean thing don't go for the
skinless chicken you know if you don't like the skin that's fine but the point
is that don't be afraid of having the whole food together as one unit or more
fat in your your burger whatever that's not the
problem it's when you combine the the starches and the sugars but doing this
will make you very satisfied so you can go longer without having to eat and when
you don't eat the insulin goes down so it's a really a good thing to help
reverse insulin resistance or pre-diabetes states now the other day I
consumed a big salad and I consumed I was out to restaurant and some lean
steak right there was no five minute I was starving about 30 minutes after that
meal and I had a huge salad why because I had no fat so it leads me to snack I
needed more food and it spice insulin because every time you eat you spike
insulin so we don't want multiple meals we want three meals a day and we don't
want to have snacks in between okay so make sure you adjust your fat so you can
go longer and you're satisfied all right but always go for the fattier protein
versus the lean protein all right thanks for watching hey guys thank you so much

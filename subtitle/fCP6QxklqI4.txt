so today i'm going to talk about the potential complications of having your
gallbladder removed there's definitely a train of thought where we don't really
need our gallbladder so there's not going to be any complications
but over 700 000 surgeries are done every single year and
40% of the people who had their gallbladder
removed have complications so i'm going to be talking about that the
medical term for this is post cholecystectomy syndrome so before
i go into the symptoms i want to talk about
why someone would experience those symptoms it really has to do with
bile so bile is made by your liver and bile drains down through a tube or a
duct and it gets stored in the gallbladder
when you eat you need less of the bile to digest food because it's
very concentrated so without a gallbladder all you have
now is the tube from your liver to the small intestines
and it trickles but it's not concentrated so typically
the complications from not having a gallbladder
have to do with a lack of bile but there's exceptions to that sometimes
there's a situation where we have too much bowel going into the small
intestine in which case you have to take a certain
medication to block the production of bile so that's a
different situation what i want to talk about is the
symptoms that occur with not enough bile now a good analogy to help you
understand what bile is
it is soap or a detergent okay now detergent is very interesting
because it is both water soluble
and fat soluble in other words you can put it on fat
like greasy hands and rub it all around and it will break down the fat and so
it's more water soluble so you can wash your hands and
it can actually go down the drain right so this
is oil and this is detergent so i'll show you what happens
as an analogy to what happens when you release bile so we're going to take this
detergent and we're going to pour it into the oil
now at the molecular structure of a detergent
you have one part that loves water and one part that loves
oil or lipids or fat so when i pour this into the oil
okay
put a little bit in there
and then i seal it up
like this okay so now just keep watching
so as you can see the detergent broke down the oil or fat into smaller
particles and that's what bile does so it's
another word for that is emulsification okay
so you can see it's in a state now where you could literally pour this down the
drain and it won't clog anything because now
it's more water-soluble your bile will break down fat into small
particles to allow the pancreas to release
an enzyme called lipase and to make it easy to digest that to even a smaller
particle where you can absorb it in your
intestine so if you are deficient in bile salts
you're going to have a difficulty digesting fats so you may experience
bloating indigestion gas burping okay so that's number one number
two constipation one of the functions of bile
is to help lubricate the colon and without bile
you may have constipation but if you have too much bile because maybe there's
a the duct is too large or the opening is
too large you can get the opposite diarrhea if you
have diarrhea you don't want to take more bile okay even as a supplement
because that's going to make it worse okay we mentioned gas bloating even
stomach pain okay you can even experience
your skin becoming more yellow or your eyes becoming yellow that's
jaundice one of the purposes of the bile is to take the byproduct of red blood
cells which is bilirubin and help you
eliminate it through the body so if there's some type of blockage
going on in the liver where you're getting a backup of
bilirubin that can come out through the skin
and create this situation right here and usually what this means is that you need
more bile to help remove the obstruction and allow the
drainage bile will actually stimulate your own
release or flow of bile through the ducts
especially if there's sludge or a gallstone sitting in there because
bile will help to dissolve it one of the causes of
a gallstone is concentrated cholesterol because there's not enough bile
to keep it broken down all right hypothyroidism your body has
certain enzymes that convert t4 the inactive version of the thyroid
hormone to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone well guess
what bile triggers that conversion so without
enough bile it can create hypothyroid symptoms
number nine your right shoulder is very very tight
if there's congestion or some type of blockage
of the ducts from your liver so you can't release the bile it backs up and
causes pressure irritation and it can create referral pain in your
right shoulder up to your neck even headaches on this side it can also
leave you with a tightness underneath your right rib cage
the solution is to take some purified bile salts
because it will help remove the obstruction and open the flow so you
have less pressure in that area dry skin dry
eyes this is a vitamin a deficiency
because bile helps you break down and absorb
vitamin a d e or k a deficiency of bile could give you
symptoms of vitamin a e d or k and then we have
vision problems a certain percent of the population
notice that their eyes are blurry after they have their gallbladder removed
or they have vision issues or they may have glaucoma
or a problem even with cataracts you need
vitamin a to prevent those conditions and so without enough vitamin a
you may have a difficult time seeing especially in the dark at night
and that lack of vitamin a can create a whole series of issues
so for all of these complications purified bile salts you can take
one or two after a meal if you want to see some quick results sometimes if you
have like right shoulder pain or tightness
underneath the right rib cage you can take one
on an empty stomach and take another one on an empty stomach later in the day
and that will give your liver a chance to drain properly and get rid of that
sensation all right thanks for watching

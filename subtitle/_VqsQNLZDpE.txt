hey guys in this video I want to share the 7 reasons why the ketogenic diet is the best for
a long-term health if you don't know anything about the ketogenic diet I put a link down
below you can check it out but here's the real reason when you actually get into ketosis which
is fat burning you're running your body in a different fuel source called ketones you're
no longer running on just glucose ketones is a superior fuel it's the original fuel that
our bodies ran on long time ago and so we we do very well on it it's a clean fuel and it's a very
very healthy so number 2 it produces the most weight loss of any diet that I know of that's
cool targeting the belly primarily ok so it will shrink the belly number 3 it improves your memory
and your cognitive function it's awesome for kids that are have epilepsy it's great for if
you have Alzheimer's Parkinson's and before it improves your mood ok so your overall emotional
state will actually help that because when you're running your body on the sugar you go highs and
lows you get irritable grouchy all the time so you might want to get your spouse on this diet
ok number 5 rid cravings and hunger yeah I mean how you going to actually do a program on top
of cravings and hunger it's insane for you to try to diet when you have cravings or you're
hungry all the time it's not going to last so this will handle that because when you run your
body on ketones you don't have that fluctuation in blood sugars number 6 it improves your metabolism
it actually can repair a set point that it's stuck at a certain weight it will help allow you to bust
through that Plateau because you're fixing this next thing right here called insulin so number
seven is fixes the insulin dysfunction and this one is very very powerful because think about
what is having high insulin or insulin resistance or diabetes turn into you get strokes high blood
pressure polycystic ovarian syndrome a fatty liver Alzheimer's I mean like aneurisms all sorts of
terrible things happen to people when they have high levels of insulin so I hope I'm selling
you on this concept that the ketogenic diet is the way to go because it's a no brainer you should try
it and I don't think you'll actually go back once you experience this all right thanks for watching

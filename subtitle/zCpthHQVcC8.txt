hi guys I wanted to create this short video on this one important point about
getting your cholesterol tested now in the past they would always require that
you fast for 12 hours before you got your cholesterol test well not anymore
now you don't have to fast you can eat before you get your cholesterol tested
and their reasoning and rationale behind the decision is that they said that
eating doesn't really affect cholesterol that much and they want to look at your
cholesterol when you eat anyway and it's also less hassle for the
patient the doctor and the lab okay so I totally disagree I would not recommend
following this advice why because you're adding in so many variables so many
different types of food that can affect your cholesterol carbs more fat and if
you're on keto you're going to be doing more in fat well the fat in your blood
I'm talking about triglycerides will go up if you consume fat in your meal so
that's going to completely alter the test and it's not going to give you a
nice consistent baseline when you test over time I mean what happens months
later when you do a cholesterol test and maybe you have a different meal and then
you shift to this other meal the lipids in your blood will change depending on
what you eat so I'm gonna recommend that you always do at least a 12 hour fast
before you get your cholesterol test alright that's it for now so I just
spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how to bulletproof
your immune system and there's 21 different lessons and I want to give you
this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is sometimes
people don't value it as much but I want to get it out there so I'm just gonna
give it to you free and I want to let you know that it's extremely extremely
valuable right now we're in a situation of uncertainty they're talking about a
second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that maybe say
who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room
no one is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm going
to teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you
can do to strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements
number one I want you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands
of people had this information to protect themselves but not only that
getting rid of the fear factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean
when you think about it it's very similar to someone being bullied in
school as soon as they learn self-defense they're gonna be less
adversely affected by these bullies so why not give you the information on your
immune system so you know what to do to protect yourself you see a lot of people
that are scared I see them on exercise like in in the park they're wearing a
mask while they're exercising or walking by themselves or in a car they're
wearing a mask and a shield so please share this course with everyone you know
if you want to help someone this is the best way to help them to give them the
knowledge of how to strengthen your immune system we want this to go viral
in a healthy way all right number two be active on your course and actually
complete the course okay take your time really learn the information there's
questions that you're gonna have to answer but stick with it but number
three send me your success when you complete
the course and sometimes when I talk to people they end the conversation with be
safe and I thought to myself what does that mean be safe well wear the mask and
also avoid getting too close to people right well that's cool but what about
strengthening the immune system that way you could be not just safe but you could
be very very smart because the missing link is a strong immune system that
gives you the ultimate protection I really believe that the best thing that
we can do both you and I to help people is to spread this out and
get everyone to know this information and here's what I came up with for the
top three people that share this course with the most people I'm gonna give them
a one-hour one-on-one video consult with dr. Burke myself and we can talk about
anything or your health or whatever and then for the top 100 people that share
this course I'm gonna give this group video access to a very special webinar
that's going to be live on a topic that I can't necessarily do in a YouTube
video because it'll be taken down but just realize it's going to be some very
powerful information that you're gonna learn that's gonna really help you and
people around you sorry to give you that mystery but unfortunately social media
is filtering out certain topics right now and the top 100 will also get access
to my virtual keto summit at the end of August last point do you get access to
this information you have to have messenger now some of you don't use
messenger and unfortunately everything is set up a messenger so I would
recommend signing up a messenger and if you don't want to continue use it after
the course just opt-out I think you're really going to enjoy this course I put
a lot of time into it the information is down below and spread
the word

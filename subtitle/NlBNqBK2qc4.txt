take a little guess what food has the highest amount of vitamin e sunflower seeds
now there are other things that have a lot more vitamin e like in wheat germ oil but this is not
necessarily keto friendly and it's more of a concentrated oil but as far as just foods
that you can buy at the store sunflower seeds are loaded with vitamin e as well as vitamin b1
but realize if you're buying roasted sunflower seeds you're decreasing the vitamin e by 80% so
you're only getting a fraction of what you really should be getting but the sunflower seeds are
high in vitamin b1 magnesium manganese zinc copper and selenium which is a real powerful antioxidant
and b6 so they have a lot of key nutrients now if you go down the list of other foods that have
vitamin e then we get to almonds then spinach swiss chard avocado hazelnuts peanuts leafy
greens other vegetables and there's quite a few of the foods that have vitamin e but here's the thing
most people are deficient in vitamin e not because they're not consuming enough foods high in vitamin
e it's because they're consuming other foods that are depleting vitamin e and the number one thing
would be refined grains but it's interesting when i was in practice i would ask people do you
consume any refined grains and they say no then i asked them do you eat breads pasta cereal crackers
biscuits waffles pancakes muffins and they go oh yeah i eat those they just don't consider those
refined grains so anything connected to a grain that's turned into flour could create a major
deficiency in vitamin e and you need vitamin e for various things it improves fertility
it decreases inflammation on the inside of your arteries in other parts of your body
it can help keep the blood from clotting so it's a good natural thinner it can decrease the risk of
chest pain or angina or other types of heart problems it can also support the pituitary which
can then help decrease hot flashes and there's a lot of other things that vitamin e can do
if you're a smoker you're definitely going to deplete your vitamin e now i've done a
lot of other videos in vitamin e but i haven't done one talking about the foods
that are high in vitamin e thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

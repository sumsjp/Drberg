hey it's me again in this video we're going to talk about the amazing
gallbladder this is part one instead of making a very long video I'm going to
make a bunch of short little videos so you can really get educated on this
vitally important organ and it is an organ and it's not an unnecessary organ
and it's not an extra organ because what bile does bile is a substance that helps
you extract nutrients from your food it's stored in the gallbladder the
gallbladder is really just a sack a storage sack and so when you eat it
squeezes a certain amount of that substance into the small intestine into
the place where you digest all this food and it starts extracting and breaking
down certain nutrients so so without this gallbladder you're always going to
be deficient without bile you'll always be deficient in the healthy fats that
you need so fat actually turns into small fat particles called essential
fatty acids also we extract vitamins from our fat vitamin A D E K1 K2 which
are very very essential we'll get into that in a little bit but the point is that
this gallbladder is very very important in your health in your longevity because
of the cascade effect that it can have on all these deficiencies I mean think
about what your brain is made of your brains made out of fat it needs DHA
that's a type of healthy fat to help repair it it needs the essential fatty
acids for your nervous system your cells your eyes bile is essential in breaking
down cholesterol to avoid gall stones bile is essential in absorbing really
key nutrients that you really need so so basically 700,000 people a year have
their gallbladders removed and so if you have a stone they just remove it right
if you have pain they just remove it because it can turn really gangrene but
they're not really looking at why they have stones and some natural remedies
one of the best remedies for stones is to supply purified bile salts back into the body
to help break that down so so the symptoms of a lack of bile which could
cause gall bladder congestion is bloating underneath the right ribcage
okay so it's underneath the right ribcage and you're in your abdomen so
you feel bloated after you eat you may experience belching or burping
after you eat you may experience constipation why because the bile is the
thing that lubricates the colon so it helps to make things go through so
that's interesting and then also it's triggered by a couple things number one
protein yeah certain amino acids trigger the release of bile also saturated
fats yep so when you become a vegetarian and don't consume animal products or
saturated fats your bile goes way way way down and so a lot of times you start
having symptoms of low bile or vitamin A deficiency that so the vision at night
can't see in the dark you might have dry skin your hair dries out your mouth gets
dry dry eyes that's all a vitamin A deficiency because you're not having
enough of the animal fats or saturated fats that's where you get
vitamin A now you might say well I eat a lot of carrots right they eat a lot of
kale that has vitamin A but it's a it's a pre vitamin A and only about maybe if
you're lucky four to five percent of it converts to the active vitamin A that
you really need the best source of vitamin A is from egg yolks butter
certain dairy and also liver I don't I don't eat liver but so I get my vitamin
A from egg yolks now there's two types of fats that are really easy to digest
on the liver and the gallbladder and that would be number one butter and
number two coconut oil they contain a type of fat called medium
chain triglycerides that are very easy and gentle on this system right here but
consuming large amount of greasy saturated fats
are very hard on the liver as well as protein so and that's why I always
recommend having a small amount with a lot of greens this whole system improves
with a lot of bitter vegetables the kale the beet leaves actual beets arugula
cruciferous those are really good if you have a problem with this area okay so
that's all I want to cover in part one and I will see you in part two

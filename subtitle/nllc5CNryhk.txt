let's talk about vitamin deficiencies in mental institutions
is it common i think it's extremely common there's quite a bit of research on this i'll
put some links down below but it's a topic and a connection that is just extremely ignored
and of course there's not a lot of money you can make using nutrients versus using medications
but dr georgia eade u.s psychiatrist great data she has using the ketogenic diet and
intermittent fasting and put some links down below of some great talks that she's given
but she said well why should the brain be any different than any other organ in the body and the
huge connection between what you put in your mouth refined carbs and sugar and how it affects your
mental state she also talks about inflammation in the brain and too much oxidative stress altering
your entire physiology and your mood state and your mental state and so there's a growing field
and i think it's going to keep growing in connecting vitamin deficiencies and mental
health let's take schizophrenia for example there's been great results using vitamin b3 large
amounts of vitamin b3 and improving this right here as well as vitamin d and even folate and
then we have depression vitamin d deficiency and omega-3 deficiencies now if you have
anemia and you're low on b12 that can also create depression but if you're deficient in vitamin d
your mood will definitely crash down and that could be the reason why someone's depressed and
you have to ask yourself like how many people are actually ended up in a mental institution
that originally this started from having a vitamin deficiency and then they're put on
a medication which creates side effects and they put another medication and side effects and now
who knows what's causing what let's take bipolar for example i'm going to put some links down below
of how keto being on the ketogenic diet can greatly improve by being bipolar
apathy could be a severe b1 deficiency if you're low in b1 you have a lot of problems
mentally you can have anxiety you can have a panic attacks you can have add adhd and of
course i have to clarify you're not going to end up in a mental institution if you have add or adhd
i just added this to the mix if you're low on omega-3 fatty acids it's going to affect
your concentration it's going to affect your brain obsessive compulsive disorder has been linked to a
zinc deficiency and also low taurine so by taking zinc and taurine which is an amino acid
you can improve this i'll put some links down below for that as well
all right then we have psychosis if someone is deficient in vitamin b1 they're going to have
problems with very specific parts of the brain that could lead to psychosis and so
i think the way of the future is to use nutrition over drugs and even adding the ketogenic diet
with fasting can be huge and so i just wanted to emphasize this one last point with fasting
you would think if you starved someone and just restricted eating that they would be
more depressed or add more stress but what happens is as your body adapts to fat burning all sorts of
miraculous things happen with their brain their brain cells actually start growing their mood
starts to elevate their cognitive function starts to improve so if you're new to my channel
i put some links down below about intermittent fasting as well so you can learn about that but
it's quite remarkable thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

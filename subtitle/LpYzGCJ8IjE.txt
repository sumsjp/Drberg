all right today we're going to talk about bile acid diarrhea that's right bile can cause diarrhea
as a side effect because bile inhibits the reabsorption of water and so too much bile
can lead to diarrhea so you would never want to take bile salts including the gallbladder formula
if you have diarrhea okay because that's just going to make it worse now many times when people
have their gallbladder removed what happens is now they just have a duct from the liver
to the small intestine there's no gallbladder left so there's really no way to regulate
the amount of bile that's going into the small intestine because the gallbladder normally stores
bile and then you eat and it contracts and it pushes bile into the small intestine every
time you eat but now there's just a duct if that duct is too big and it's just draining too much
uh it can lead to a lot of complications and then what happens your doctor will give you medication
to block that so we don't have as much bile now there's a couple other reasons why you
might have diarrhea from bile because your liver makes bile those are called primary bile acids
but then also the intestine will make bile salts as well but what's normally supposed to happen
because your body is very very efficient with bile you're supposed to recycle 97 of all the
bile that's going through the small intestine it acts like a detergent that can actually kill
microbes because normally you shouldn't have bacteria in your small intestine just the large
intestine so it's supposed to kill everything through there and then get reabsorbed at the last
part it's called the distal part the last little part of your small intestine
okay if there's damage within that part of the intestine or you have iliitis inflammation of the
ilium or you have some type of inflammation in that area you're not going to reabsorb
that bile so therefore you're going to have more bile than you really need and that can create
diarrhea so this is why you might see this in ibs or even sibo which is small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth because the bile is not actually killing the microbes in the small intestine so
therefore the microbes are now living there they're growing and they're robbing your nutrition
and when you consume food you're going to get a lot of bloating so one thing you can do is
get a stool sample to find out if this is what you have because they can identify in the stool
how much bile you have versus other things the other thing you can do to slow down the
diarrhea is to consume fiber fiber tends to bind with the bile and it will slow things down i would
highly recommend you do what's called low fodmap vegetables i'm going to put a link down below for
more information on that but that would be things like carrots green beans tomatoes zucchini spinach
radish kale cabbage because certain foods that are high in fodmap which are certain types of
carbohydrates that can create more bloating are going to be worse for you the other thing
you want to cut down in this fat because fat stimulates the bile production so i just wanted
to give you a couple tips on this if you have this condition it can be very devastating and there is
some things you can do about it hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate

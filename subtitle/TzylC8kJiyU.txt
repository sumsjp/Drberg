hi guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to share some tips with this condition called
interstitial cystitis which is painful bladder syndrome we have this combination of painful
bladder urgency to urinate painful urination and a bunch of other symptoms here's the data
first of all there is no cure yet they don't know what causes it but here's some data that they do
know number one there is no infection usually there's no bacterial they do find antibodies
within the wall of the muscle that contracts smooth muscle that contracts with the bladder
so that's interesting so there is some immune reaction going on there's inflammation it creates
urgency and pain alright it does involve the autonomic nervous system it does involve the
part of the sympathetic nervous system so that's pretty much all they know so my whole thought
on that condition is as you're getting your body healthy overall not trying to address that symptom
you know cut out cut down the insulin cut out some of the things that can trigger it like caffeine
and alcohol and msg but there's a remedy that I think will help you greatly in the meantime to
give you some relief and it's natural it's called l-arginine it's an amino acid this must be taken
on an empty stomach not with food because it will be inactivated I would recommend taking 2 grams
every single day on an empty stomach because this amino acid does a lot of things but it'll increase
something called nitric oxide nitric oxide is a natural thing in your body that relaxes the
smooth muscle because think about it the there's a contracted muscle going on in your bladder and
it's creating pain so this will help relax that muscle and inhibits the spasm so it's something
you can take in the meantime to give you some relief as you get your whole body healthy so go
ahead and try that and put your comments below you know I'm just wanted to take a moment out

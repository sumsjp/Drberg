will the sight or the smell of a carbohydrate
knock you out of ketosis and the answer is depends if you give into it but no
this sight and smell will not spike insulin however it potentially could
stimulate dopamine and dopamine is a neurotransmitter it's it's similar to a
hormone but it works for the nervous system in the brain and the effect that
dopamine has is pleasure it's the anticipation of a reward it creates more
want it's involved in lots of addictions now if you happen to smell chocolate
chip cookies coming out of the oven okay you may start to stimulate dopamine or
how about that bread baking in the oven the smell is actually incredible isn't
or what about the aroma of this amazing pizza that's being served to you at an
Italian restaurant or let's say for example you're smelling this kentucky
fried chicken and you're hungry right you may start stimulating dopamine and
then you have the visual of it right or this delicious bread butter that they
just took on the oven and they served you before you're going to eat your meal
at the restaurant oh and by the way I'm really curious go ahead and type in the
comments section of that food that you cannot resist now here's the interesting
thing about this on a study that I'm going to post down below dopamine was
only increased okay upon exposure to certain smells or source visuals if it's
exposed to someone that already has addictions or has a weight problem
that's a binge eater if you don't have addictions and you're not a binge eater
guess what dopamine will not be spiked and this is actually really good news
because when you start a ketogenic diet and you do intermittent fasting the need
for eating every few hours disappears and so even if someone
waives some cookies in front of you or shows you something you're gonna be less
tempted simply because you're not gonna spike dopamine so this is a very very
good thing to know about if you have addictions and you want to overcome them
and I'm talking about alcohol addictions drug addictions and definitely
carbohydrate addictions and if you're new to my channel and you've never heard
about the ketogenic diet you don't even know what I'm talking about
and you definitely don't know what intermittent fasting is click the link down
below you definitely want to know about this
thanks for watching

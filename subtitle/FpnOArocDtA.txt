there is a huge mistake when you're
counting carbs on keto because it's not
all about carbs
sometimes people think that um it's all
about just bringing your carbs down
below 50 grams and you're good to go
other people think you have to go really
really super high on the fat to be keto
but today i'm going to get into
something really really important that
will make your keto plan work a lot
better so the question is why do you
reduce your carbs below 50 grams
because carbs increase insulin
and it's really the insulin that blocks
ketosis so we're trying to generate
ketones right
and so the more the insulin goes up the
less we're going to be in ketosis and if
we can't be in ketosis
we're not doing the ketogenic diet so
people start counting carbs they start
looking at sugars they start focusing on
the glycemic index but what's missing in
this whole thing is the understanding
that protein also increases
insulin especially if you have insulin
resistance or you're a diabetic or
you're pre-diabetic i mean there's so
many times where a diabetic will
go a low-carb okay and then they'll have
this huge steak as their dinner and they
wake up in the morning the sugar is just
like off the chart how can that be i ate
low carb it's the protein so protein has
the ability to increase insulin
not as much as carbs but it will
increase insulin all right so now that
you know that
there's only two foods that do not
trigger insulin okay
fat
and fiber but also when you combine
these two with other foods you buffer
the insulin okay you reduce the insulin
and i'm going to explain that in a
second because no one just really eats
you know just protein or just fat or
just carbohydrates it's always a
combination of things so i'm going to
give you a really good principle to
think with on this topic from my book
the healthy keto plan
on page 154
that is called the insulin
index okay the insulin index
that is the scale
of
foods that trigger
insulin and that goes beyond the
glycemic index which is all about just
how much a carbohydrate will spike your
blood sugar this is talking about
the non-carbohydrate
things okay not just sugar not just
other carbs but even proteins and
variations of fats in protein
that could trigger insulin because this
is the most important thing we need to
focus on when we're trying to achieve
health okay and of course you know you
already know that sugar will trigger
insulin and various carbs will increase
insulin and you probably also know that
it's important to have normal blood
sugar right i mean you don't want it too
low you don't want it too high
and the more you go on low carb the
lower it will go so before that number
would have been classified as
hypoglycemia low blood sugar but now
it's your new normal because you're not
consuming
carbs you're running off of fat so they
consider like hypoglycemia being like
below 70 right i mean when you do keto
or intermittent fasting 70 would be
completely normal okay even sometimes 65
or even 60 or even lower will be normal
you'll feel good
and so don't think you have hypoglycemia
as a as a bad thing if your blood sugars
are that low because if you're then
misdiagnosed and you're they tell you
just oh eat some sugar
now you actually start the whole cycle
again where you're gonna create more
problems but it is important to have
perfect blood sugars okay so
anywhere between like 70 and 80 okay
that would be ideal because if that
sugar is too high
as well as having the insulin too high
these are the symptoms tired you get fat
your cognitive function gets less
your mood becomes a lot lower
you start developing metabolic syndrome
and you get hungry all the time and then
if it's low you get irritable you can't
sleep shaky craving
hungry when your blood sugars are are
perfect boy you're going to feel your
optimum okay so that is one goal in
addition to all the other benefits we're
trying to achieve by going on keto or
intermittent fasting
now this insulin index is very
fascinating because
the lower the number the better okay the
less insulin that's triggered so
like butter would be two now butter has
a tiny bit of other things in it that
probably brings it up to two or else
it'll probably be zero
but butter is two so that's that's low
it's not going to create much of any
type of spike with your insulin pecans
are five why because it has a good
amount of fat it's a fatty nut
walnuts are nine why are walnuts higher
because
they're not as fatty as a pecan
now let's take a look at egg yolk it's a
15.
look at egg white it's 55
okay why
because egg white doesn't have any
protein in it if we combine an egg white
with egg yolk we get a whole egg which
comes out to right in the middle 21.
so again i want you to think with the
concept of
normal fat that comes with the protein
is going to be better for your insulin
stabilization so anything low-fat or
lean or skim
is not going to help you
because we want this insulin low the
more lean a protein is the more low fat
the higher the insulin the less your
ability to get into ketosis now let's
take something that's really high on the
insulin index
whey protein powder why
because it's there's no fat in it it's
super high and
a lot of people take it as a supplement
with maltodextrin because they're trying
to build muscles because their whole
idea is to actually increase insulin
okay that's what they want to do
to stimulate muscle growth because
insulin is an anabolic hormone okay
but my question is
when you do this you're combining
something that's very high on the
insulin scale and something else that's
very high on the insulin scale as well
as the glycemic index in fact
maltodextrin is
higher than glucose it's probably the
highest thing on the gi
index
you're creating insulin resistance
that's the negative part of it okay so
you're going to end up maybe creating
some muscles with a lot of insulin
resistance now some people genetically
maybe might not create insulin
resistance but a lot of people will if i
consume this i would feel like crap
because it would start to aggravate my
pre-existing insulin resistance problem
now let's just take not that you would
eat ice cream low-fat ice cream
versus regular ice cream okay what's in
low-fat ice cream we have high carb we
have a low fat
there's some protein in there okay
what's in regular ice cream high fat
and high carb and some protein in there
so what would be lower on the insulin
index
of course the regular ice cream because
it has more fat and fat buffers to some
degree the insulin response now of
course i'm not telling you to eat
regular ice cream i'm just showing you
this so you can think with this so if
somehow you're out there and you are
forced to eat ice cream
choose the regular ice cream not the
low-fat ice cream all right check out
this right here
we have whole wheat bread okay
versus white bread
it's almost the same as far as insulin
so why is white bread higher on the
insulin index because it has less fiber
fiber
buffers
the insulin response all right check
this out relating to
fat
tuna like in a can
is 16 if it's in oil but it's 26 if it's
in water why is this one higher because
it doesn't have the oil the oil is
supposed to buffer the insulin response
and there's no oil in there so that is
why it's higher
let's take a look at whole milk okay
it's 24. but look at skim milk it's 60.
you see the difference there why because
there's a lot less fat in skim milk
now let's take a look at something else
let's look at beer it's 20
white wine is three now for this one
we're not talking about fiber okay we're
not talking about fat
we're just talking about the
relationship between how beer will
affect your insulin levels versus white
wine
so obviously now you're probably around
and start drinking white wine but here's
what you need to know
there's something else in
alcohol that creates the problem and
that is alcohol so there's alcohol in
both of these and that's going to create
the liver damage and it's going to give
you a set of additional problems so it's
not always just about insulin it's about
other things in these ingredients okay
so now i hope you have some deeper
concepts that go beyond just the carb
counting
but i think the best video to watch next
would be the one on the glycemic index
and glycemic load that's something a
little bit different so check it out i
put it up right here

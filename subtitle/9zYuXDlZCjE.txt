hey guys in this video we're going to do
an faq on a
new product but actually it's an older
product i had this product in a long
time ago probably one to two years ago
and i couldn't get it anymore so i
finally found a way to get it back
a lot of people were asking about this
but it's a friendly bacteria probiotic
and it's a liquid
non-dairy when you take it it doesn't
get destroyed like other probiotics that
get destroyed by the stomach acid so it
can survive that
okay so let's start with the benefits
helps you
maintain regular bowel movements okay so
you have constipation diarrhea let's say
you took an antibiotic before and the
bowels aren't right
this is one thing you could take it's a
kind of a deodorizer
so it helps to purify one of the groups
of microbes and there's actually
three groups of microbes lactic acid
bacteria
friendly yeast and something called
photosynthetic bacteria
lactic acid bacteria greatly reduce and
inhibit
the methane gas bacteria the type of
bacteria that actually
you know gives you some odorous gas so
when you take this
it will help that condition and you have
friendly yeast which does
several things one thing it makes b
vitamins now people are
kind of concerned about yeast thinking
that if they take this it's going to
give them a yeast infection
no no your body naturally has a friendly
yeast
what happens if you don't have enough of
the good yeast
you get an overgrowth of the bad yeast
and candida
and that can grow in different places in
the body even your toenail
different parts of the body on the scalp
so the friendly yeast actually protects
you
against the unfriendly overgrowth of
yeast
then you have photosynthetic bacteria
which is pretty
fascinating these microbes can adapt in
just about any environment
with oxygen without oxygen with light
without light
under extreme temperatures they allow
other microbes to exist or coexist
together
and they help our immune system as far
as the deodorizer goes that you can
actually take a very small amount of
this
and dilute it in water and spray it on
mold like in your basement and actually
helps that or even
your septic tank i've done it and it
just kind of gets rid of the odor
within hours it's quite amazing certain
farmers are using in agriculture
and they're using it also for animals as
well and plant growth
but the big benefit is these microbes
help you maximize the absorption of
nutrients
as well as build up your defenses your
immune defenses because your
largest immune system is in your gut it
was developed by a professor in japan
named dr
turbo higa okay he's the one who
developed the effective microbes
i've done other videos on this before
but he he stumbled on this by accident
he was doing research on agriculture and
he would use
or back then they use various strains of
microbes like
just one strain and they would put it
into the soil and they would see what
happened
so one day he actually um was done and
he combined like all these microbes
together and he was ready to toss them
out
then he had an idea as he's walking
across this patch of grass just to pour
it into the grass
so he comes back several days later and
he notices that patch of grass just like
is flourishing it's just growing like
crazy
so then he gets a bright idea he starts
doing more research and then he comes up
with
this product right here all right so
what does it taste like
okay so first of all you're not going to
actually drink it straight you could
it's kind of like a molasses but it's
kind of bitter okay like a
i guess a combination of vinegar and
molasses
but what you want to do is you want to
take um start up with a half of a
capful that's a half of a tablespoon and
put it in about
a little bit of water like a third of a
glass and drink it before you go to bed
now if your immune system is very
compromised and it's very fragile
you'd want to take a smaller amount like
let's say a couple drops
and slowly increase so just start out
with a half of a capful
okay in water before bed for a couple
days
and then increase to the entire cap on a
rare
occasion you might detox a little bit so
you might
feel a little bit tired but you're
sleeping anyway so you're probably not
going to notice it
but if you take one capful that's one
tablespoon and that would last you about
32 days
okay so this is like a one month supply
so one last point if you do
detox on this stop taking it for a while
take smaller amounts gradually over a
longer period of time
if you have an imbalance of microbes in
your gut you actually
need this but in very small amounts if
you take this and you
start to detoxify stop taking it
until all that reaction goes away okay
because there's an immune reaction going
on
it doesn't mean you don't need it just
means you're taking too much too fast
so take a very small amount only after
the detox
reaction has gone away completely and
then slowly increase and i'm talking
like maybe
you know half of a teaspoon for a while
and then gradually
build up your microbes until you're you
have no more reaction again
all right thanks for watching hey if

keep you updated on future videos

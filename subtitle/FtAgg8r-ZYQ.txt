so let's talk about the highest
blood sugar
ever recorded
in history
it was recorded in 2008
by a type 1 diabetic a child
named michael patrick
boonikor now think about what normal
blood sugar is okay it's like 80
milligrams per
deciliter his blood sugars were 2
656
milligrams per deciliter i mean this is
like astronomical i mean i've heard
people having blood sugars of 300 400
500 and 600 but that's when they usually
go into a coma so this just blew me away
of how high a blood sugar could actually
get now realize you have insulin that is
constantly buffering the sugar it's
taking the sugar out of your blood
constantly and he was a type 1 diabetic
so he didn't have any insulin obviously
he didn't take his medication so his
blood sugars just went
you know kept going higher and higher
now ingesting one gram of glucose okay
will raise your blood sugars about
roughly
five milligrams per deciliter so just
think about how much sugar someone would
have to consume
to raise their blood sugars over
2 000 milligrams per deciliter but again
you have to take in consideration
insulin because insulin's gonna come in
there and take it out of the blood but
if you have insulin resistance or you're
pre-diabetic or diabetic that's going to
be a problem because with insulin
resistance
you might be pumping out all this
insulin but it's not working to lower
your blood sugars this is why the blood
sugars start increasing now today i want
to talk about something very very
interesting that relates to blood sugars
it's not just sugar that will raise your
blood sugars it could also be stress now
let me explain when you go through
stress your body needs quick energy
so your liver is going to start making
glucose okay and it has nothing to do
with your diet
you can be eating
healthy foods
but your liver will start converting
like protein
fat
ketones into glucose and that process is
called gluconeogenesis
now there's a really really good test
that could be done
which measures
an average blood sugar over two to three
months it's called a1c
and a1c
basically measures
how much of the protein your blood
is glycated or damaged from sugar so
when the sugar goes up in the blood it
destroys the protein and this process is
irreversible okay it's permanent so you
have to now wait two to three months
before that red blood cell has been
dealt with by the body so a1c is a
really good
measurement
of the average of your blood sugars over
you know roughly three months
and it's a really good way to determine
if someone is
cheating on their diet too because
let's say you're doing great through the
week and you're checking your blood
sugars each day and everything comes out
real good but then on the weekends you
go off the program
well with a1c you're measuring this
average for three months so you're gonna
pick up those times that you cheated but
let's say for example
you're not cheating and you're not
eating sugar and you're eating really
good you're on the keto plan you're
doing intermittent fasting
but your a1c is not coming down in fact
it's going up
well it could be
stress
because like i said before cortisol is
another thing that can cause your liver
to start producing sugar
even if you're on the ketogenic plan and
not eating any sugar so your body can
get sugar from the diet or it can make
it when you're under stress
so unfortunately when people go through
stress they smoke they take drugs
they eat poorly
they drink alcohol and of course none of
these things lower blood sugar they just
make things worse so if this is your
situation let's say you cleaned up your
diet but your stress is too high and
that is affecting your blood sugars or
you wake up in the morning and your
blood sugars are high
despite not eating any sugar
a real simple remedy would be to
exercise
okay
one good workout every single day
will usually handle this excess amount
of sugar that's being produced because
of stress
i'm talking about not just a tiny
workout but you know at least a half
hour to 40 minutes of a workout
exercise reduces cortisol exercise helps
your sleep
exercise also lowers your blood sugars
directly because it's burning up that
extra sugar in your blood but also i
want to mention this if you do physical
work
around your yard or even in your house
that can even be a better form of
exercise because you're
handling a lot of the mental stress
sometimes even more than
getting a treadmill which you're just
you know mechanically walking so
depending on the exercise you do a
really big part of this is taking your
attention off the mental stress
now i want to mention two additional
things that are really really important
if you're sodium deficient if you don't
consume enough salt
that can keep your cortisol going higher
cortisol does help control
sodium
and so this is why when people go
through stress they might crave salty
foods if you are on a salt restricted
diet
um that could be one reason why your
cortisols tend to go higher and that can
also indirectly affect your blood sugar
so i'm just bringing up this point about
sodium because a lot of times people
don't consider sodium beneficial to
helping reduce stress
and one common symptom
of a sodium deficiency would be weakness
and fatigue as in keto fatigue
aka
adrenal fatigue
so adrenal fatigue is the same thing as
keto fatigue and really both of those
are a sodium deficiency because a
person's not consuming enough salt
and of course make sure you have the sea
salt now one last thing i want to add to
that
you should also add potassium to that as
well a good amount of potassium because
potassium can not just lower cortisol it
can lower your blood sugars it actually
helps insulin resistance so salt and
potassium and exercise are a great way
to keep your stress low and keep your
a1c low if you want a really good
recommendation of how to get
enough potassium i put a link down below
in the description now i think a really
good video for you to watch next is the
one that i did on sea salt check it out

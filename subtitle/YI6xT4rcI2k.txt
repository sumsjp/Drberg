so I get this question very often so I decided to do a quick video to answer it
will MCT oil break my fast MCT oil stands for medium chain triglycerides it
is a type of fat that is usually extracted from palm oil or coconut oil
coconut oil has MCT oil in it but when you're getting MCT oil you're getting
just medium chain triglycerides and that's a type of fat that can turn into
ketones very very fast now we'll break a fast well what is the definition of
break a fast is it the same is less than your ability to stay in ketosis or will
it lessen your weight loss results I'm gonna define breaking it fast as
diminishing the results of a fast okay now there's many benefits of going on a
fast weight loss cognitive benefits mood benefits it has a huge benefits of
reducing your inflammation anti-aging benefits and those benefits come from
ketones directly as well as turning on or turning off certain genes for example
there are certain genes that are inhibited like cancer genes this is why
fasting decreases the risk of getting cancer but even the growth of tumors are
inhibited when you're doing it fast so there's many different benefits of going
on a fast but when we take MCT oil we're not going to break a fast very much
maybe just slightly and for a very short period of time because MCT oil is going
to turn into ketones very very fast and the benefits of ketones are huge your
hunger is going to decrease you're going to have better brain energy it's going
to make it easier to transition into ketosis especially in the beginning if
your brain here's a picture of your brain has the option of ketones or sugar
okay it will always use ketones first or sugar so if you were to take MCT oil
those ketones are going to feed your brain and your brain is going to be much
happier so it's gonna help your cognitive function
it'll help lessen the symptoms especially when you're starting out
doing the ketogenic diet usually you're not going to see any slowdown of weight
loss despite providing some calories because those calories are going to
quickly turn into energy now if you're exercising it's a good thing to take
about 30 minutes before you workout just a small amount to provide more ketones
to have more endurance so that was my long answer the short answer of will MCT
oil break my fast is not very much
we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no
sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto

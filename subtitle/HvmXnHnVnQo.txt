hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about postponing early
death part two okay in the series of three before I tell you what it is this
one thing causes cancers probably from my viewpoint one of the top things that
causes cancer number two it causes strokes okay number three causes heart
attacks and number four it creates tumors can you guess what it is
take awhile guess it's estrogen okay too much estrogen and that's why even for
women they use a drug called tamoxifen what does that do that blocks estrogen
why because estrogen causes cancer now our bodies make estrogen the problem is
that makes too much or you're exposed to some environmental estrogen from either
the chemicals that trigger estrogen like even the pesticides insecticides on our
foods mimic estrogen not to mention the growth hormones and the other things
that even the genetically modified foods can increase estrogen so we have a
situation where our bodies are bathed with estrogen even men are getting
enlarged prostate that's high estrogen which can lead to prostate cancer and
even women are getting fibroids that's estrogen men are getting breast tissue
that's excess of estrogen so estrogen is becoming a huge problem now women that
take hormone replacement therapy maybe for hot flashes or something like that
or or younger women that take birth control pills that's all estrogen
dumping into the body it has side effects there's some rule of thumb that
you're not supposed to take birth control pills over seven years the
question is I have I see people taking it for 20 years or 30 years they're not
looking at the long-term effects of estrogen estrogen basically causes
cancer so we want to balance it in the body and it also can create clotting
which then creates heart attack or stroke okay and the next part of this
I'm going to show you what to do about it okay
this is how lower estrogen there's three simple things you need to do now if
you're taking birth control pills or a hormone replacement therapy I would get
with your doctor and find an alternative because the problem is it leads to
cancer down the road we want to prevent that
okay so cruciferous is a type of vegetable that has comes from the word
cross and it'll be like kale broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage those
things cruciferous is highly anti estrogen that means it protects you it
cleans up the estrogen from the body I mean like even kale will literally
dismantle the stored estrogen in your liver and it cleans it out I'm not to
mention it actually helps you with cancer itself that helped reversing
cancer but the point is that cruciferous vegetables are a must now how do you
consume them I personally like to buy kale and I put it in bags and I freeze
it I also buy parsley I love parsley with kale the combination and I will put
a little bit like a cup of either fruit like berries not fruit the berries and I
will put that in the calcite or sometimes I'll use my berry flavored
kale powder okay instant kale powder so I blend that up but I always will cut a
lemon and squeeze the juice of one lemon in that shake because lemon is really
good to offset any type of things called oxalate stones prevent kidney stones but
anyway I squeeze it in there blend it up for about three or four minutes I have a
high-powered blender and I drink that whole that thing I'll drink half
of it and then I'll wait for a little bit and I'll drink the other half maybe
three or four hours later I keep in the fridge okay but that is very anti-cancer
and it's going to protect you against the excess estrogen that you're being
exposed to and now organic you want to consume organic because organic is
without pesticides and herbicides and fungicides and things like that so those
things all mimic estrogen so if you can go organic that would eliminate that
factor and then when you consume the cruciferous that will clean up the
residue in your body okay very simple and then with the me
animal products make sure it's hormone-free okay i like to go one step
further and do grass-fed and i also like to do with my eggs pasture-raised eggs
okay not pasteurized pasture-raised eggs okay so those are
some of the things that I would do to help lower estrogen and increase your
longevity in the next part three we're going to talk about the last factor I'll
see you in the video hey guys thank you so much for watching I really appreciate

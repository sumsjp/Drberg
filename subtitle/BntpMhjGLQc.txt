hi guys I'm going to talk about what to do if you have residual pain after dental work whether it's
a tooth extraction a cavity or they're injecting a needle and they're numbing the gums here's what
you do and if you've been watching other videos you already know what I'm going to say you're
going to work on the opposite side so let's say it's a tooth on this side right through and here
and it's up into the gums and you it's been days and the pain won't go away you simply press on
the opposite gums mirroring the image mirror image opposite and you go right up into the gums if it
was a needle you press there it'll be very tender on this side but it will actually relieve the pain
on this side same thing with the tooth you would just match whatever tooth is on the opposite side
and you rub it now they took out both on both sides you can work on the bottom side right to
here the key is matching the exact opposite tooth down here or matching the tooth over here you're
just going to massage it and that's how you get rid of residual pain after dental surgery
or dent or just a cavity thanks for watching I just want to take a moment to thank you for
your amazing amazing successes that you guys are writing about and I would love to have a complete
success story from you with a before picture and an after picture as well if you have that
I'd put a link down below so you can fill it out if you don't have a weight loss before and after
just put an image of yourself and your success I would love to read it and I would love to share
it with others because it does give them hope that they could be helped too thank you so much

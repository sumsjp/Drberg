hi guys I want to answer the question that someone presented to me and they felt they wanted to know
why they felt so sick when going on a ketogenic diet and it doesn't seem to be getting better
okay so we're going to talk about that this video you know you can call it the keto flu you can call
it being nauseous but here's really the big reason why you would get sick on a ketogenic diet there's
several factors okay one there's really actually only two factors now there's three one is you're
introducing more fats into the diet okay now if you don't have a gallbladder if you don't
have enough bile and you add too much fat that's going to overload the liver in the gallbladder and
you're going to feel more nauseousness in loading and right shoulder pain okay so that's that okay
so if you don't have those symptoms we'll put those over here the next reason why you would
feel sick is that the ketogenic diet does tend to deplete certain requires certain nutrients
because you're switching from sugar burning into fat burning so you in this fat burning machine
in the cells you're requiring more vitamin b5 vitamin b6 b1 from other B vitamins potassium
you're requiring more of these nutrients that you weren't necessarily requiring over here and if
you're deficient in these nutrients you're going to feel kind of funky ok so that could be why
you're feeling like that so you want to increase either some electrolytes potassium magnesium and
even sodium okay and then the B vitamins and that should handle it if that doesn't handle
it then we're left with the third reason which is basically you've been running your whole body
on sugar your whole life ok and now we're trying to convert over to a completely different machine
with new enzymes and you're not used to and for some people they can switch from sugar burning the
fat burning like that other people especially are if they're pre diabetic or have insulin resistance
it could take a while ok now there's two ways you can do this you can either bite the bullet
and go cold turkey and just switch over and just go through this transition period which shouldn't
be more than three days to a week okay of feeling kind of funky and then you'll start feeling better
or you can do it more on a gradient a gradual amount where you're doing the ketogenic diet
but you're adding in maybe some other things on the transition okay so now that's what I want to
talk about what you would you add in there so it's not to create a problem I think you should start
number one just eliminating all refined sugars okay and grains okay so that would be step one
but you also have in there you're eating some fruits okay so that's your transition you should
not feel pretty feel too bad from that so you're doing this ketogenic diet with some fruits maybe
a baked potato maybe like a yam sweet potato or a yam or maybe some quinoa something like that
okay but you're not doing any wheats you're not doing crackers you're not doing chips you're not
doing actual sugar of a candy okay and you do that for a while so your body can kind of get
used to it and then you slowly start taking away the fruit a little bit more and more and more and
then you take away the yams or sweet potato and I think for some people that's the way they should
do it so they don't feel sick but again this is not the majority it's for a select few that just
their system is not kicking over fast enough so number one make sure you don't go crazy with the
fats number two put the B vitamins electrolytes in number three cut back this this high-level change
and go gradual okay by keeping in some fruits definitely berries would be the best I wouldn't
do apples but try to do something maybe pineapple something like that alright thanks for watching

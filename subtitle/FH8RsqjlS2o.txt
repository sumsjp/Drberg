I want to talk about why I consume four eggs every single day I did a seminar at
Exxon many years ago and I noticed they didn't invite me back and I called him
up I said why can't I come back and do another seminar because I do a seminar
series and they said well you're recommending 45 eggs a day
I said no no no no I didn't say 45 eggs a day I said four to five eggs a day
okay and they go oh okay yeah you can come
back but generally I will need four eggs and sometimes only need five eggs per
day now of course those eggs are not consumed at breakfast they're actually
at my first meal right around one or even two sometimes three o'clock in the
afternoon so one of the key reasons that I consume eggs on a regular basis not
only do I enjoy it but eggs have the greatest anabolic effect okay anabolic
means that it's turning into muscle protein or other proteins so it's
building more protein in the body I have a little scale here that shows these
percentages and the type of protein so egg forty eight percent of it actually
turns into body tissue and I'm not talking about even absorption I'm
talking about forty percent of that egg actually turns into your body tissue and
that's pretty much the highest not counting breast milk unless you're a
baby you're not gonna be able to get it now when we take meat fish file that's
32 percent okay much less an egg white is 17 percent which is fascinating
because that cholesterol and fat actually help in the anabolic effect
look at soy only 17 percent it might be high in amino acids but it does not turn
into body tissue that well dairy whey this would be like cheese and whey
16 percent very small spirulina six percent so if we take 4 eggs comes out
to 24 grams of protein times point four eight so eleven point five two grams are
actually turning in the body you look at me 24 grams only 7.68 grams
of it is actually turning in the body tissue so you're gonna have to consume
more meat to get the same efficiency as for eggs okay
Dairy is only three point four eight grams actually turning into body tissue
so you can see that you would have to consume a lot more dairy to create this
effect so eggs are very efficient in turning in the body tissue not only that
they're very high in nutrients they pretty much have every single vitamin
and mineral except item and see the load with B vitamins choline healthy fats
which is right here so it has DHA EPA it has a lot of the carotenoids which is
good for the eye prevent macular degeneration
it has choline which helps prevent a fatty liver and helps your nervous
system now if there's any consideration your mind that eating eggs will increase
your cholesterol realize that there is absolutely no data that will increase
your so-called bad cholesterol LDL it will increase your good cholesterol HDL
so it is not bad for the heart so you don't have to worry about that so anyway
I just wanted to point this out and recommend that you also get
pasture-raised organic eggs it's a little bit more expensive but it's
definitely worth it thanks for watching if you're liking this content please

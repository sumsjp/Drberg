now this video is going to talk about the amazing huge influence of fasting on your genetics your
genes what's a gene it's your blueprints or code or instructions for building proteins now i'm not
just talking about muscle or tendons or ligaments talking about the little proteins involved in all
the biochemistry in your body from making hormones neurotransmitters to releasing stored glucose
for fuel so you have millions and millions of these proteins but they have to be instructed
of what to do and when someone does fasting some magical things happen to your genetics fasting is
just one but a very important epigenetic influence over your genes now what does epigenetic mean
epigenetics is something above genes it's the thing that controls your genes
your genes can either be turned on or turned off upregulated which means
turned on or downgraded turned off to a certain degree so fasting is a very potent
trigger for turning on or turning off these genes now there's certain genes like this one right here
cfhr1 gene which gets massively upregulated when you do fasting and this is the gene that helps you
regulate cholesterol now the sirtuin gene which is anti-aging also gets turned on and up regulated
when you fast yet at the same time there are other genes that get turned down
one being the app gene which is responsible for making amyloid plaquing which you see in
alzheimer's so you can read between the lines fasting will help decrease this plaquing then
you have some other interesting genes right here that are overexpressed when you get certain types
of cancer these genes are down regulated this is why fasting is so vital if you have cancer or if
you're trying to prevent cancer if you haven't seen my video on an interview of someone who had
stage four cancer who now doesn't have any cancer i'll put a link down below with that interview
because it's quite amazing he did some massive fasting different variations of fasting he did
one meal a day sometimes he did seven day fast he even did another fast that was over 40 days which
you really need to know what you're doing but he did it and now he is cancer free but you can start
getting benefits from fasting at a 16-hour fast at 18 hours you're going to get a little bit
more benefits at one meal a day you're going to get even more benefits so fasting affects your
genetics fasting also stimulates something called autophagy which is your body's ability to recycle
damaged proteins as well as clean up microbes and viruses out of the body fasting
drops inflammation supports the immune system specifically the stem cells in your bone tissue
fasting will help you build up your antioxidant networks your body actually can make antioxidants
and you build up this network when you fast fasting builds up the cellular stress
resistance it makes your cells resistant to stress fasting not only helps with the metabolic syndrome
syndrome x but it will increase your metabolism it can actually reverse the degeneration
of brain cells it's quite amazing there are also certain genes that get down regulated that
can trigger bipolar as well as downgrading certain genes that are responsible for depression
this is why you get mood elevation and so many cognitive improvements so on that note
i put a link down below of exactly what you need to do when you start fasting check it out
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

i want to share with you some information on potassium if you're an
athlete i highly recommend you start adding more potassium to your diet and here's why
you have something in your body called the sodium potassium pump okay in all the cells and this pump
maintains the electrical gradient of the cell keeping potassium in the cell and sodium outside
the cell when basically that means it helps form the voltage of the cell because your
cells are many batteries and the purpose of the cell being a battery is to activate nerves
in muscles and when we're talking about athletics we're talking about activating the nervous system
and the muscular system so if you're deficient in potassium you're going to get a little bit weaker
your muscles are not going to relax and contract like they should you're not going to necessarily
have the endurance that you should and a lot of focus in sports has been on sodium and hydration
which is very very important but what about potassium we need more than double the potassium
as we do sodium so i want you to try this experiment add more greens and or potassium
foods to your diet for a couple days and just observe how much better your workouts are
in strength endurance and your muscular tone then for a couple days restrict yourself of potassium
work out and notice what happens to your strength your endurance and your muscular challenge and
then you really know for sure and so there's two factors here we have the factory of getting enough
potassium in the diet and then we also have avoiding certain things that deplete you of
potassium like refined carbs and sugar and also when someone goes on a ketogenic diet they start
doing low carbs they get rid of a lot of glycogen that's stored glucose and potassium is also needed
in the storage of glucose and so when you get rid of this extra stored glucose as glycogen
you also get rid of potassium so you're going to end up being potassium deficient and so this
is another reason why potassium is very very important especially if you do keto so with
the factor of sugars and refined carbs depleting potassium we have the factor of potassium help you
store glucose and then we get rid of the excess glycogen we do keto and you're now running on fat
you need more potassium so whether you're doing more carbs or less carbs potassium is a very very
important factor especially if you are exercising hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

so your skin will give you a lot of clues on what's going on
deep inside so today we're going to talk about the seven
skin warning signs of diabetes and this could also be
pre-diabetes now there's actually more than seven but these are the main ones
number one a dark patch of velvety skin usually in the back of the neck armpit
groin and the medical term for that not that you really care
is called acanthosis nigricans number two hard thickened skin
especially on your knuckles in the back of the hand also on the toes
number three boils okay that is definitely related to blood
sugars and cysts like the baker cyst that is a blood
sugar problem and even if you don't have
diabetes or even pre-diabetes if you have insulin resistance i've seen
a lot of people who just get these boils and they wonder why
because their blood sugars or carbs are just too high
number four itchy dry rashes a lot of people have this they go to the
dermatologist and they're trying to figure this out they get put on
cortisone creams prednisone which basically increases the blood
sugars makes it worse as soon as soon as they come off the
medication when in fact if they went on a good keto diet with
intermittent fasting this would probably go away bed source
and this mainly has to do with the effect of high sugar
on your circulation to your vascular system to the capillaries
and to the skin number six skin tags and the skin tag really comes
from a virus and so being a diabetic puts you
at risk of having these viruses come out of remission
and creating skin tags and seven red or brown spots on the lower legs or
your shin that's called a diabetic dermopathy
and you're getting again poor circulation and the lower
part of your body not to mention nerve damage in your feet
but many times if you look at a diabetic's ankles or their lower part of
their legs you have edema swelling and it could be
even shiny they have a loss of hair and they have these red and brown spots
gang green that would be a skin change that's more
advanced when you actually lose circulation in
your toes and then you it starts to change
color if you are a diabetic or pre-diabetic
or have any of these at all even if you're diagnosed
or not get on a keto plan a healthy keto plan and intermittent fasting
and you may be very successful in reversing these

alright guys you just watched my basic plan the overview this is video 2 we're
going to dig into some more of the details this is mainly for people that
are new to my channel again I have 2500 videos and if you can get lost in all
the details this is the second video that you should watch and we're
combining a healthy keto within a minute fasting okay alright number one you want
to go as long as you can in the morning without eating you just don't want to
eat unless you're hungry that's the the thing that you need to focus on because
so many people eat when they're not hungry and they're wondering why it's
not working they're not getting results because the body finally is burning fat
and then you start eating what will happen is you're gonna raise insulin and
then if your instants gonna come high and then it's gonna push your blood
Sugar's low then you're gonna be hungry an hour and a half later
so really it's what you ate the night before that's gonna dictate if you're
hungry in the morning if you do this correctly like I'm showing you with just
two meals a day you're gonna wake up in the morning not hungry so the goal is to
go as long as you can you may find that you can't go all the way to lunch you
have to eat it like 11 o'clock fine eat your breakfast there okay but what will
happen you want to keep pushing it to the point where your your body is fully
adapted to fat-burning you're no longer sugar burning that could take three days
up to five days sometimes it takes longer to get into full ketosis alright
so that's the first rule of thumb if we can do two meals with a four-hour window
okay and what that means is that we eat and then we wait for hours and we eat
again that's your window that will give you a 20 hour fasting period that's
incredible that's enough to see some serious results the only time that would
not work for someone as far as weight loss goes is let's say they're going
through menopause they have a slow thyroid condition and they have a
history of dieting and their metabolism is so slow they're gonna have to push
these together have one meal a day and then they will
lose weight and there are even people that still will lose just a little bit
on this and they might need to go even longer because their metabolism is so
dead and I've had this happen not to a lot of people but certain people that
just you know from birth they just had a slow metabolism for one thing or another
and they need to go like probably eat every other day okay that's just what
they need to do until the system heals but for everyone else we're going to
talk about what are you gonna eat on this first meal and the second meal I've
surveyed a lot of people and this is what they eat and this is what I hate
eggs I do four eggs a day you can do 2 to 4 eggs pasture-raised or organic eggs
they're a little more expensive but they're worth it now it's really
important to eat healthy eggs because the factory farm eggs are just so bad
they're just terrible then we have avocado avocado has tremendous amount of
potassium and really good fats to help you go longer
cheese now if you are a guy and you have a prostate condition don't do the cheese
but if you have a high quality organic cheese from a grass-fed cow goat's
cheese is even better not a problem okay so then we have bacon some people don't
want to do bacon that's totally fine I like bacon I do bacon from the farmers
market if you're gonna go to a huffin store get the nitrate free Organic bacon
with with sugars less than one gram okay bacon by the way and pork has high
levels of vitamin b1 and for those people are saying bacon is unhealthy yet
they're consuming chicken I would beg to differ because chicken is really
disgusting unless you're doing again from the farmers market okay nut butters
you can do almond butter peanut butter make sure there's no sugar in it maybe a
couple of tablespoons now the reason for this is to give you enough fat
especially in the beginning so you can go longer okay without getting hungry
you know you're eating at 12 you have a hamburger or a piece of meat or any a
lamb or whatever meat that you want three to six ounces let's say you're
younger and you have a faster metabolism then you do eight ounces let's say for
example you're an athlete you do eight ounces let's say you're a very large
person you need more protein do eight ounces I wouldn't want to go over eight
ounces per meal now we're not talking about actual protein grams we're talking
about the actual product of meat itself okay three to six ounces or eight ounces
so you don't have to calculate the grams inside that meat but it is a big
difference and then we consume our vegetables you can steam them you can
have some raw or the salad I do a lot of salads we need a large amount of salad
so some people break up their salad between this meal here in this meal and
they do maybe five cups and five cups or maybe four cups and four cups I mean
four cups is not that that much it's just it's kind of like a medium sized
salad I personally do all of my salad at one sitting I'll do like ten cups and
sometimes I'll do more than that so I'm used to it
if you feel worse with consuming those greens that means that you're microbes
are not quite in the right place you might have a condition called SIBO I'll
put a link down below in which case you want to cut back on your vegetables
because what's gonna happen the fiber in the vegetable is going to retain fluid
and you're gonna feel bloated and you're gonna your weight loss is not gonna come
off it's not because you're not losing weight it's because you're retaining
fluid okay just realize you want to feel good after consuming this and you may
have to eat small amounts and gradually increase it because guess who's eating
your the fiber from your vegetables the microbes and they might not be plentiful
enough to do that so there's many different reasons I'll put a video down
below just on that one topic olive oil balsamic vinaigrette is a great dressing
maybe a handful of nuts some seeds because we want that fat so this is like
one option of a meal this is another option of meal just to give you an
example I put a link down below to my website because I have a lot of
different examples of different meals I have a whole recipe but this would be an
example of a typical meal for someone okay let's say you do fish I love salmon
is one of the best proteins because it has omega-3 we want to do quality
protein so you can also do sardines believe it or not there are good fats in
sardines I did a video on that for seafood
okay this gives you the iodine so you do your fish or seafood your salad this is
for your dinner and a fat bomb what is the fat bomb it's like a little cookie
with healthy fats in it you can make recipes for this a lot of people consume
the fat bomb just to get them satisfied so they can go from one meal to the next
as your body adapts to fat burning you probably won't even need that because
you're burning your own fat but in the beginning it's really helpful here's
another option for some food you can do chicken with the skin preferably nice
and crispy or chicken wings let's say you do again treat it 6 ounces of
chicken and chicken wings do your protein it's moderate protein asparagus
ok or any other vegetable that you like or your salad and then you do olives as
your fat okay I do a lot of nuts myself I do that
after the meal to the point where I'm like really satisfied so I can go longer
but the key is not snacking at night so you want to add enough fat to go from
this meal all the way to breakfast now the number one weakness people have I
just realized was boredom so you're gonna have to keep really busy right
here and make sure you're not bored so you don't eat the wrong thing you can
consume your vitamins it's not a problem any time of the day apple cider vinegar
teaspoon and some lemon is really good to have when you drink water coffee in
the morning try to just do one you can do tea you can add some bulletproof
that's a MCT oil coconut oil you can put that blend that in your drink if you
want especially in the beginning to allow you to go without having the first
meal not a problem but if you find that that
slows down your weight loss as you do this over a period of a couple weeks and
you might want to drop out the extra fat urged a snack that means you need more
fat and more greens more vegetables those two things will solve the problem
if you crave bread you need more B vitamins I recommend electrolytes a good
powder B vitamins and or nutritional yeast you
can get them in tablets very important just to make this transition smooth so
you have no problems C so don't be afraid to add more sea salt because
you're gonna need more salt you're gonna dump more fluid on this program and so
you have to replace it the best time to exercise is when you're
fasting so in the morning okay it's actually you get better benefits realize
that it could take longer to adapt but the way that you know you're in hardcore
ketosis is that you crave nothing you're not even hungry anymore that's
when you know what's really working better than any other test this should
give you the next layer of information or knowledge you need to know and I will

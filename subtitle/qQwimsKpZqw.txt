let's talk about chronic fatigue achiness
and stiffness many times this is coming from what's called a
mycoplasma now what is a mycoplasma it's a very
very small microbe probably one of the smallest
known microbes nanobacteria might be a little bit
smaller but they're both in the same family
you see these microorganisms involved with secondary infections
you see them with lyme even hiv they don't have a cell wall so they're
very stealth your immune system has a very difficult
time finding them and antibiotics may not work
they may help initially but then this mycoplasma keeps coming back
and it's highly associated with rheumatoid arthritis
and it can even trigger various autoimmune
diseases it's definitely connected with symptoms
the gulf war syndrome fibromyalgia and i already mentioned
lyme is there anything you can do naturally because the problematically is
that the treatment usually destroys your own
immune system and then that weakens your ability to
fight this microbe you definitely have to go low carb why
because mycoplasmas live on glucose and other carbohydrates
so it's very very important to go ketel fasting is essential because it will
help strengthen the immune system especially if you do periodic prolonged
fasting so let's say for example you did 48
hours every two weeks or every month or even
72 hours that would be very beneficial as well as fasting's ability to trigger
autophagy which will help clean up and kill microorganisms in
the body and recycle them the herbs that are recommended and
they're natural antibiotics with very minimal if any side effects

now these will have a tendency to potentially detoxify you unless you
also consume bile salts before you start this so i would do bile salts
for the first day just do two per day on an
empty stomach spread out like do one in the morning one at night
what this will do it'll open up the flow through the liver
allow drainage it's something you'd always
want to do before a detox then you start adding these in there and
then also continue to take this along the way because
sometimes when you start killing off microbes you release endotoxins
and endotoxins have the capacity to shut down your bile flow and then you
get this backup of toxins to the blood and you
can actually get all sorts of detox reactions so
bile salts help to reduce the side effects from detoxification
okay so number four zinc at least 100 milligrams per day
this is going to strengthen your immune system and vitamin d3
30 000 ius per day that's going to reduce
inflammation what's going to happen after about a week
is your energy is going to start to come up you're going to feel
less achy less stiff more joint mobility and realize that you may
need to do this protocol for several months to really stabilize your
health all right thanks for watching

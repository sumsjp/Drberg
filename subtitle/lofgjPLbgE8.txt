hey guys today we're gonna talk about the many different causes of acne okay
let's start off with the food allergies if you are alerted to certain foods that
can create a reaction on the skin big-time
it might not even look like acne but it can create a redness all sorts of scaly
dry skin and that could be coming from a food allergy however there's also
chemical sensitivities food intolerances that are not necessarily an allergy if
you suspect that there are certain doctors that specialize in that what
happens when you eliminate certain foods that are creating the reaction boom the
skin clears up really really fast but this is one of the reasons why
intermittent fasting is so powerful do intermittent fasting first and see if your
skin dust just doesn't clear up right away and then you know potentially that
can be the problem number two high androgens what's an energon it's a male
hormone okay women should not have excessive amounts of energons and
they're getting facial hair they're losing their hair they're getting in a
deeper voice they have a lot of other issues with fatigue and inflammation
this high level of antigen also will cause acne and it's usually coming from
high insulin okay so the healthy ketogenic diet is the ultimate diet for
someone with PCOS because it cuts down the carbs it cuts down the insulin and
then it helps to normalize your androgens stress can also increase the
adrenals which activate more androgens and also a very powerful testosterone
called DHT can cause acne as well as hair loss okay and a good remedy for
that it's called stinging nettle root stinging nettle root is hands down one
of the best remedies to help balance this this powerful testosterone it's
also really good for inflammation anywhere in the body okay stinging
nettle room don't forget that one low vitamin A will cause acne a vitamin A
deficiency and this is one of the reasons why accutane is so popular it's
a synthetic version of vitamin A but has a lot of side effects so the best source
of vitamin A that I would recommend would be virgin cod liver oil
okay one reason why you might not have enough vitamin A is you don't have
a gallbladder or you have a liver problem or you don't have enough
microbes to help you recycle the bile to help you absorb vitamin A so there could
be like a situation when you you took an antibiotic and now you have an imbalance
in your gut and you have IBS and things like that you're gonna have a problem
absorbing vitamin A it also could be that you had a gastric bypass so that
could be one of the reasons too but virgin cod liver oil is awesome and if
you don't have a gallbladder then you need to take purified bile salts with it
to help you absorb vitamin A and that will help the skin realize we're dealing
with an inflammatory condition of molecule on the skin so anything that
will help you lower inflammation is going to help the skin zinc very very
important in skin health if you're deficient in zinc you will get dry skin
you can get back knee you can get flaky skin
guess what depletes zinc in your body high carbohydrate diets surprise zinc
picolinate is a good remedy moistures probably have the highest amount of zinc
anywhere zinc is also in liver a healthy grass-fed liver now we get to high
levels of estrogen can cause acne this is why during menopause some women get
some acne also through the menstrual cycle you can get acne that is a spike
in estrogen we've talked about antigens but high estrogen can also do it then
you have something called cystic acne which is an advanced form of acne which
is really an estrogen dominant problem the remedy for all three of these
situations is something called DIM I put a link down below for more information
but it also blocks the excess amount of estrogen being produced in the body
which is coming from testosterone alright so here's what I'd recommend
number one get on a healthy keto plan or put a link down below this may handle
all of these things without even doing anything always add intermittent
fasting because this kicks in the repair mode it helps your skin your cognitive
function but it's gonna also eliminate any potential food allergies or chemical
sensitivities vitamin A and zinc are really good
products cod liver oil zinc picolinate are good also you want to lower your
stress as much as possible cruciferous vegetables you could also take DIM as a
as a substitute because this is like two pounds of vegetables in one tablet but
cruciferous vegetables on a regular basis will help to balance estrogen now
there's one more thing if you have aging spots or little blemishes and you and
you want to just improve that the color of the skin vitamin b3 in the form of
niacinamide which is the water-soluble version and
you mix it with either coconut oil or olive oil and put it on your skin you
can greatly help the health of the skin and if there's any type of blemishes or
dark spots you can actually improve that situation I like the version of
niacinamide because it's water soluble and it seems to go in better you can use
niacin but it doesn't seem to absorb as well okay all right guys thanks for

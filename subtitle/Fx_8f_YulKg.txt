Hey, guys.
Dr. Berg here.
In this video, we're going to talk about how much fat you need to consume on a ketogenic
diet per meal.
There's a lot of theories out there, but I have an unfair advantage because I have a
lot of people I can practice on in my clinic to see what works and what doesn't work.
I'm going to show you what works.
A couple of things that people bring up all the time is, is a ketogenic diet, which means
you're eating more fat, is that dangerous for your heart?
The answer is no, it's not.
In fact, it's not the fat that plugs up your arteries, it's the sugar.
There's tons and tons of studies, I'll put some links below, on this fact.
Ketogenic diets are not dangerous if you do them correctly.
Second question that people say or they've heard, they say, "Well, the more fat that
you eat, the more fat you're going to burn."
That's another myth because you could be burning the dietary fat and not your own fat.
Now, the whole concept of the ketogenic is that you're having very low carbs, moderate
protein, higher fat.
What I found is we want zero sugar, unlimited vegetables.
In fact, we need more vegetables because if you do this, ketones are acidic, and the ketones
can potentially raise your pH, and you can end up with either gout, a type of arthritis,
or kidney stones.
The way to prevent that is to consume a lot of vegetables, and also lemon.
Lemon actually prevents kidney stones.
The other key is to don't consumer sugar with fat.
Why?
Because it will increase insulin even more.
We don't want to add the sugar to this eating plan at all.
The other point is you want to do this gradually.
If you're increasing fats too quickly, it's going to overwhelm the gallbladder, and you're
going to have right shoulder pain, and bloating, and things like that.
That's why I recommend that if you're going to do this, I'd recommend the gallbladder
formula because that gives you the enzymes and the bile to help handle this fat in the
transition.
Number two or number three is that it does take time to adapt to your body to fat burning.
All these cells must change their enzyme structure, their machinery to handle this new fuel source
because we're limited in the glucose, and we're increasing the fat, and it does take
sometimes between two, three, four, five, even six weeks to make this transition.
The process, we're going to do this nice and gradually so your body can go right into it,
and you'll feel really good.
Now, let's talk about how much fat that you really need.
Now, these are list of fats that you can potentially consume.
By the way, I have a link that I'm creating below so you can download this chart, which
actually is right here.
This one right here.
Basically, this is a short version.
Heavy cream, one tablespoon is five grams of fat.
An average person, and this is very general, needs between 20 and 40 grams of fat per meal
on a ketogenic diet.
40 would be the highest scale of someone really large who's been doing it in a while.
20 is someone smaller, and they're just starting out.
We're going to calculate this midrange at 30 grams just to give you an average.
Heavy cream.
You can make whipping cream.
I have a video on that.
You can make all sorts of things with heavy cream.
Five grams, you would do six tablespoons per meal.
You're going to have that right after the meal as your fat.
The fats could allow you to go longer so you're not as hungry, and it's not going to increase
insulin.
It's exactly what we want.
You may only be doing two meals.
If you're concerned about calories, which I actually did add calories to this, do two
meals, especially if you're not working out.
You'll find that once you adapt, you can burn your body fat as a fuel source, and you can
go a long period of time without having to worry about it.
Now, egg is five grams of fat.
Now, realize that there might be more than five grams for the egg, but we're talking
five grams of fat.
One egg is five grams.
You need three to four eggs per meal.
I do four eggs in the morning.
Sometimes, people do two or three.
That's totally fine because you can combine these in certain ways.
Now, let's get to the beef.
We got three ounces is 16 grams, about three to six ounces of beef.
What I want to show you is an example of this beef that's frozen right here.
This is some beef that's 85% lean.
I do not buy the 90% lean.
I like the 80%, but it's hard to find it.
I like this thing to be more fat, but this is the type I have, which is grass-fed, organic
beef.
Just so you know, I do the pasture-raised organic eggs.
That's the type of eggs that you need to consume.
Then, we get coconut oil.
One tablespoon is 14 grams.
We're just going to double that, and have two tablespoons.
Now, you can put that on your vegetables.
You can make little treats.
There's all sorts of recipes you can make, but that's the amount of fat that you would
need per meal.
Brie cheese, three ounces, 28 grams.
You would just do three ounces.
I'll show you, brie cheese is very high in fat.
I actually took this, and I drew these little lines here to show you what three ounces is
just to give you an idea.
It's a little slice of this.
This is four three-ounce sections.
This is 12 ounces of cheese.
One of this for a meal would give enough fat, but this also has the protein, so you could
kill two birds with one stone.
I do a lot of cheese.
Another idea, here's some other cheese right here.
This is a German cheese.
Just less than half of this is three ounces.
That gives you an idea.
It's like a little bit bigger than a ï¿½ Yeah, it's not a card deck, but it's a little bigger
than the palm of your hand, but half of this should be three ounces, just to give you an
idea.
Almond butter, one tablespoon is ten grams.
That would be three tablespoons of almond butter that you would consume.
You can do that right after a meal.
That would be your fat.
Olive oil with one tablespoon, 14 grams, so two tablespoons of olive oil.
That's really easy just to put on your salad.
Boom, you're done.
Of course, some of this is going to end up in the bottom.
Maybe you want to add another one, but that would give you about 30 grams of fat.
Pecans, 10 pecans is 20 grams.
If you do 15 pecans at the end of the meal or maybe macadamia nuts, that would give you
enough fat.
Ice cream.
Now, you're saying, "Wait a second, ice cream.
Can I have ice cream?"
There are certain ice creams that have no sugar.
In fact, I'll show you the one that I have right here.
I put a chocolate brownie on here.
That's a recipe that we have in some of the videos in ice creams, and you can basically
make this ice cream or get it from the store, and it has no sugar.
One cup would you give 22 grams of fat.
Now, personally, this is an ice cream that I'm developing right now.
I'm having my own line of ice cream.
Now, I'm experimenting right now, and it's not perfected.
I'm in the R&D stage.
In fact, a couple of day ago, I had all my staff consume this much ice cream.
I gave them a container because I wanted to see what would happen.
Half of the group had some digestive bloating.
It's temporary, but still it's not perfected yet.
We're going to be perfecting this.
I have to go back to R&D, and how figure out how I'm going to fix that because the last
thing I want to do is have you get it, and have you bloating, and call me up, and say,
"Dr. Berg, gas me out."
I don't want to go there.
The ice cream is made with a high-quality fat, no sugar, but we have to figure out the
fibers in there.
We're working on that right now, but that would be down the road.
Some people want to know when it's going to be.
I don't know.
I'm going to have it done when I perfect it.
This will give you an idea.
If you download the chart below, it will give you an idea of how much fat that you really
need.
Go ahead and apply this.
Go ahead and write your comments below.
I hope this helped you.
I'll see you in the next video.

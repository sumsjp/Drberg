i want to talk about the best and worst foods for belly bloating
a lot of people have this and so they're not sure exactly what causes it
there's several reasons number one you can be lactose intolerant many many people have
an intolerance with lactose which is milk sugar and if you're doing any type of dairy with the
exception of cheese and definitely butter because both of those products have virtually zero lactose
so if you're lacking an enzyme that helps you break down that milk sugar you're going to bloat
next condition is sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth this is a situation where you have the
good bacteria in the wrong place it should be in the large intestine and it's not it's in the small
intestine so you eat food fiber it gets fermented in the wrong place your small intestine is not
the place where you're supposed to ferment fiber and this is where you're going to get a lot of gas
and pain because the microbes are fermenting the fiber not a good situation next condition would be
just having low stomach acid as you get older you do not have the stomach acid to break down
especially proteins so you might find that red meat will bloat you things like that also it takes
a very strong acidic stomach to release bile from the liver so they both work hand-in-hand
now you can actually just be low in bile because either you don't have a gallbladder or the liver
is not producing enough bile maybe you're on a low fat diet because fat triggers the release of bile
and then there's a lot of other conditions that involve inflammation in certain parts
of your digestive tract that can definitely cause bloating and then you have food allergies you can
be allergic to casein which is the protein in milk or to the protein in peanuts or to eggs
and it's really good just to get a food allergy test to pick that up and gluten is a big one if
you're allergic to gluten or have a sensitivity to gluten which is the protein in certain grains
you're definitely going to bloat you'll get inflammation all right on the left we have a
list of the worst foods for bloating beans lentils soda not just the high fructose corn syrup in the
soda but the carbonation msg foods that includes a lot of fast foods msg has the potential to
increase insulin and create insulin resistance and that alone is going to create a lot of digestive
issues dairy we've already mentioned that briefly grains we've already talked about gluten
fruit apples big time pears and other fruit will definitely cause bloating beer broccoli cabbage
brussels sprouts onion and almonds okay so if you have bloating you might want to just eliminate
these foods right here the best foods for reducing bloating would be leafy greens maybe a smaller
amount so usually people can digest lettuce fairly easily and they don't have a problem but
when you get into more of the cruciferous even kale for some people that can create bloating
for me if i consume broccoli it'll tear me up i never consume broccoli i would love to
but i can't do it i can do cabbage i can do brussels sprouts not a problem but
broccoli i can too fermented vegetables are very good for the digestive system
kimchi very beneficial for the gut because not only does it have the prebiotic
but it also has the probiotic at the same time and as a side note i have found that some of
these items listed on the worst section can be lessened as far as creating less bloating
if you at the same time consume some probiotics i want to try that as well of course i'm not talking
about beer all right eggs seem to be pretty easy to digest unless you have an allergy
fish is fairly easy to digest especially if it's fatty fish and you don't have an allergy
proteins that normally come with more fat are much easier to digest than lean proteins ginger good
for bloating asparagus pistachios pistachios create the least bloating almonds create the
most bloating i also consume pecans in small amounts it doesn't bloat me large amounts it will
fennel will help reduce bloating lemon will help you mint mint tea spearmint tea is all great for
bloating and a fatty hamburger without the bun now when you consume a lean hamburger you'll notice
more digestive issues and bloating than a fattier hamburger and so the fat in the protein
helps you release more bile to give you better digestion now there's two last things
you might want to consider if you have bloating one is making your stomach more acidic by adding
something called betaine hydrochloride and they come in little tablets and you may need
starting out five before a meal could be a little bit more but you'll find that you'll
you'll digest much better second thing is bile salts i recommend taking bile salts after the meal
not before it's not an absolute necessity but it can help you because many people are deficient
in bio hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here

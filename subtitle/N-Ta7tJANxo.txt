we're going to talk about the common hidden carbohydrates now i can't do
enough videos on this topic because inevitably someone is going to be
stalled on keto and wonder why it's not working and then
come to find out they're consuming something that they
had no idea had some hidden sugars in it so
let's go to the list now when you consume
beef animal products is virtually less than one gram of carbohydrate
usually per serving size but when you consume liver
you have to realize that there's glycogen in there which is store glucose
our bodies tend to hold stored glucose in the liver and the muscles but
apparently when you consume animal muscle meat it's actually pretty
low but it seems to be retained in the liver
so i mean it's not much but it's something so if you're doing a strict
keto diet and things are kind of stalled you know you might want to do an
evaluation and really add everything up so
in three ounces of beef liver 85 grams you have 3.2
carbs okay number two sausage deli meats bacon and i'm talking about the sausage
deli meats and bacon from a regular grocery store
not a health food store they do have hidden dextrose
cane sugar three ounces on average has about eight carbohydrates
so it's actually a bit too high so you wanna start reading labels really
pay attention to the sugar and then the ingredients to see if it has any
sugars in the ingredients now this is interesting
oysters six medium oysters have about 10 carbs you would think they
would have zero carbs but they don't there's some carbs and mussels scallops
and clams now it's nothing to really add up to anything but
if you're trying to really count your carbs and keep it under a certain level
you really need to realize that there are some carbs in some of the seafood
imitation crab meat seven grams of carbs it has the type of carbs that you don't
want to consume like potato starch tapioca starch so when you look at the
quantity of sugar you really want to make sure
what is the source of that sugar because potato starch and tapioca really
will spike the blood sugars a lot higher than other
sugars number five stevia and monk fruit
sometimes you buy in a powder and then even you have truvia which is
in a powder and splenda isn't a powder if you read the label they have dextrose
or maltodextrin you want to avoid that so just because
it's stevia or monk fruit or truvia or even splenda does not mean
it's keto friendly number six teriyaki sauce
it has up to nine grams of carbs per serving so it's pretty high
number seven low-carb sugar-free keto-friendly desserts and products
read the label a lot of times you'll find that they use maltitol
or sorbitol they're very high on the glycemic index it's
almost like you're consuming sugar number eight certain medications like
cough syrups throat lozenges have a good amount of
either high fructose corn syrup or dextrose a lot of sugar there's other
medications that are loaded with sugar as well and
then something called imo's iso malto illegal
saccharides now this is a type of so-called keto friendly fiber that they
put in various things like syrups and other
sweeteners i used to recommend it until i noticed
when i consumed products with this i could really feel a
blood sugar reaction so i did some more research and found that
it's going to increase your blood sugar so you want to stay away from it so i
just wanted to increase your awareness about carbs and foods that you may not
suspect thanks for watching before you go if you
have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a
debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the u.s
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

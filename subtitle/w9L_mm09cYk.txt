this video is for those women who had their ovaries removed and want to prevent
some of these side effects that can occur 30 of all women will have their ovaries removed i mean
it's kind of strange to me that that many women would need their ovaries removed and sometimes the
doctor will tell you oh it's fine you don't really need them anyway well you actually do need your
ovaries and when you have them removed there are some serious consequences number one significant
loss of bone okay in your spinal vertebra i'll put some links down below to substantiate that
vaginal dryness could be a side effect depression anxiety decreased libido
hot flashes but other than that you'll be doing great now what can you do if you had your ovaries
removed well there's several things pomegranate now you can actually take the seeds and put them
on your salad you can just eat them you can get pomegranate seed oil as a supplement and
there's several phytochemicals that you get from pomegranate that mimic your own body's estrogen
in a positive way if you have a deficiency of estrogen or an excess amount of estrogen
pomegranate can help balance your estrogen because it helps block the bad estrogen so
this is a really good remedy number two flaxseed oil can act as a natural
hrt hormone replacement therapy very essential if you don't have ovaries number three tribulus
which is a natural compound that can increase something called follicle stimulating hormone
and that hormone is made by your pituitary so it can actually help support in the missing
hormones now also realize that your body is a backup to making some of these hormones like
the adrenal gland for example the outside of the adrenal gland called the cortex
also makes these hormones and so anything you can do to support the adrenals would be a good thing
and tribulus is a actually a good thing that that not only supports your pituitary hormones but also
the adrenal hormones as well it can act as a an adaptogen for stress helps you cope
with stress and it'll give you a lot of energy as well number four wild yam has the potential
of decreasing the symptoms of estrogen withdrawal now also realize that i'm not telling you that
you need to take all of these but if you take a few of them i think that would be a good thing
this last one i think is essential though it's called ovatrophin pmg it's from a company called
standard process i used to recommend it when i was in practice but it's a really good product to take
if you don't have ovaries it's a glandular extract it's called ovatrophin pmg you'll
just have to look it up online and get some and probably take about i'd say two before bed

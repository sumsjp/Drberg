i'd like to talk to you about the dark
side
of the birth control pill
now
this is fascinating because there
actually is no
real estrogen or progesterone
in
a birth control pill what you do have is
a synthetic version
altered in a way to mimic
estrogen and progesterone okay but it
has
some slight minor complications it comes
with a package it can increase your risk
of heart attacks high blood pressure
stroke blood clots
breast cancer dementia depression acne
mood swings it can even trigger
autoimmune diseases
especially lupus
it can cause you to gain weight by
increasing
cortisol
and insulin it can also deplete you of
zinc
selenium
magnesium b12 another side effect it can
create is something called melasma which
is
like a hyperpigmentation of your skin
where your the pigment of your skin is
darker in like a rash form
also it can alter the microbiome not
only in your gut
but in the vaginal canal as well now
when you think about the reason why
women take the pill
mainly to prevent getting pregnant but
they also might take it to prevent heavy
cycles and have you bleeding okay so
there's various reasons why women take
it so the birth control pill basically
tricks the brain and shuts down
ovulation ovulation is
usually about right around day 14 when
there's a release of the egg so by
taking the birth control pill
you shut down ovulation and you also
shut down menses so you typically you
don't have bleeding even though some
women still do spot but what a lot of
women don't realize is when you take
this pill
you are shutting down the production
of estrogen and progesterone you see
in a monthly cycle
a woman has a spike of estrogen at day
14 and then they have
this other
increase of progesterone the second half
of the month so this is very different
than men that make testosterone on a
daily basis but women make their two
hormones progesterone and estrogen
more with like two major spikes not
necessarily
every day
so the problem is when we remove this
okay
we're not looking at the effects long
term i'm talking about the long-term
effects that can occur after menopause
to the bone even longevity you see the
reason why women live longer than men
really has to do with estrogen estrogen
can act as an antioxidant
but all this is kind of depressing if
you're taking the pill or considering
a birth control so what
should you do well let's just take a
look at the effectiveness of how well
these birth control pill methods work of
preventing pregnancies okay so
the pill is between 93 to 99
effective depending on how well that you
use the pill and follow directions okay
then we have vaginal rings which is 93
effective you also have iuds you have
the hormone version which is 94
effective and you have the copper iud
which is 99
effective now the copper iud which i did
a video on
is a bit better than birth control
because it has less side effects but it
does come with
certain complications
condoms 87 effective but this next one
is something that you should look into i
like it it's fda cleared it's called
natural cycle birth control it's an app
that you track you don't have to use any
creams or medications or anything and
it's actually pretty effective it's
between 93 and 98 effective depending on
how well you implement it and you follow
the instructions
i mean considering some of the side
effects from some of these compared to
this
it's definitely something to look into
so i put a link down below
so you can do some research on this
method right here because this may be a
safe solution
now if you've been in the pill or decide
to continue on the pill
i would highly recommend the same time
you do things to counter some of the
the chemicals that are in your liver and
i would recommend
beefing up no pun intended your
cruciferous vegetables as well
as fermented vegetables i'm talking
about sauerkraut and kimchi and maybe
even a good probiotic
as well as taking
more zinc selenium
b12
and magnesium to counter
the deficiencies that this pill has
created now one last point if you're
taking the pill for other reasons let's
say you are trying to
avoid a heavy period
this is the video that you should see

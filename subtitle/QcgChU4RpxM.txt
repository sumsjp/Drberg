i found some interesting information on
soy i'd like to share with you today
because when you do a search on soy
you're going to find all sorts of
wonderful positive things about it it's
very difficult to find anything negative
on soy but there is a lot of negative
about soy and so there is conflicting
information out there now when you have
two facts that appear to oppose each
other creating this conflicting
information well you can't have that
happen one of the facts is not a fact
and so what i want to do is i want to
give you the other side of soy so you
could just make a better decision on if
you want to consume soy anymore but the
reason i'm talking about this is because
soy is in 60 of our foods so it is just
widespread all over the place
and the soy eaten in asia is very
different than the soy eaten in other
parts of the world like america i don't
think asians consume a lot of soy
protein isolates or a lot of soy oil or
vegetable textured protein
or even consume the amount of soy milk
that americans drink they typically tend
to eat more fermented soy but i found an
interesting paper on soy that you really
need to know about i put the link down
below
but i'm just going to summarize it okay
first of all you may already know that
most of the soy is gml which means it
has traces of glycophosphate which is an
herbicide and a lot of the soy out there
is processed with a solvent called
hexane
and hexane is not
a
healthy thing it's a very toxic
solvent also soy is very high in omega-6
it's very inflammatory
in 25 trials involving soy for
menopausal women with hot flashes it was
demonstrated that there was no
improvement in hot flashes yet how many
millions of women are taking soy for hot
flashes and the other thing that's
interesting about soy
is that out of all the soy produced
85 of it is split between
soy milk
and oil soy oil and out of the 80
percent that is soy meal
98 of soy milk is
used for animal feeds okay
cattle pigs and definitely
chickens
which you
eat and there's not a lot of safety
studies and the type of soy milk that
they're getting is not the
fermented type soy
that
asians consume it is usually the
byproducts of soy when they're making
soy oil and then we have two percent
goes to humans and out of the 20 of this
85 percent okay the oil version
we have 95
sold to humans and 5
used in industrial type things so it's
in our dressings it's in our all the
processed foods if you go to any fast
food restaurant they're typically going
to use soy oil to fry your food in so we
have a very refined processed
rancid
highly omega-6 inflammatory oil
which has some slight minor
complications like disrupting your
intestinal border talking about all the
little villi that are supposed to absorb
nutrients there's a report that shows
that it creates atrophy of those little
villi
and then there's a series of compounds
in soy okay
one compound in soy shows a lot of
conflicting information and some studies
it will show that it will decrease the
risk of cancer in other studies it shows
no change yet in other studies it shows
that it increases the risk of getting
cancer
and
increasing the tumor size
which would make sense because it's very
estrogenic and the same compound shows
hepatotoxicity that's toxicity to your
liver
anti-thyroid activity okay so it shows
the effect of blocking the conversion of
t4 to t3 the active form of thyroid
hormone it even shows that it can block
iodine
there's reproductive toxicity there's
endocrine disruptions so it messes with
your hormones
infertility allergies
nephrotoxicity that's toxicity to your
kidneys
and even pancreatic hypertrophy where
your pancreas is enlarging so you can
see it creates a lot of problems but why
is soy so prevalent in our foods well
this is my opinion
soy is one of the foods that they
subsidize okay so the government will
actually pay farmers to
grow that product
and you also have corn wheat and many
other products
but soy as being a subsidized product is
at the top of the list so the very
reason why we started subsidizing crops
is to help farmers during times of need
but now it's used as a regular thing for
farmers did you realize that 85 of
subsidized products
go to 50
multi-billionaires
just 50 ceos so
us as taxpayers
fund the government which then pays
these farmers
to grow this food
that we really shouldn't be eating
so obviously if you had a business that
you could get the government to pay you
for the raw material that then you can
sell and make a profit um that would be
a very profitable type venture so i
think it's very obvious to you why
there's a huge push to get people to
consume some of these products that are
subsidized like corn products soy
products grains
and really turn these products into a
healthy thing to consume so there are
some things you can do about this as a
consumer okay
because if people buy these products
less then the market shifts to other
products
so number one you want to be highly
selective of what you order at a
restaurant okay
don't order the fried foods don't order
foods with soy
but start asking restaurants what do you
use as your cooking oils okay and ask
them do you have other oils that are not
corn
canola
soy
cottonseed oil and start suggesting that
they use olive oil coconut oil things
like that all right number two put more
attention on reading labels and just
don't buy any products that have soy
ingredients
and number three this is one of those
really obvious things that might sound
really simple
but start eating at home because you'd
be surprised
how many people have digestive problems
and bloating
and they're just routinely going out to
dinner and they don't realize that the
food that is served in restaurants are
very high on these omega-6 fatty acids
and it's really hard to control your
food so just eating at home could be a
therapy for your digestive system and
number four you want to balance out
these these fatty acids start eating
more omega-3 fats versus the omega-6 now
in a positive note if you want to know
the best foods to eat

hey I'm back in this video we're going to talk about why ketosis and
intermittent fasting really works now in a lot of other videos I talked about the
benefits just by avoiding junk food hi lots of sugar reducing your insulin that
alone is huge but there's some other very important reasons why you get
health benefits from Quito in if' and I want to teach you what that is so I want
to introduce you to a new word whore misis and this word is in the field of
toxicology okay what this word describes is a cellular process that involves an
adaptive response to a low dose stress that gives favorable biological effects
okay what does that mean it basically means it's a good stress
like exercise for example you add a stress of the body and then you get a
positive outcome and here's the word you stress you meaning good positive stress
that's what this term is describing so you're exposing someone to a low dose
toxin or a stress and the body adapts and it becomes stronger
so with ketones you're basically shifting the fuel source which does
create a little stress on the cells because it has to adapt and that takes a
little bit of time and also within a minute fasting you're actually doing a
version of starving but intermittently okay it's creating a little bit of
stress to create all sorts of interesting effects which I'm going to
get into right now okay so when you adapt to ketosis usually takes 3 to 5
days but it could take even longer if you have very severe insulin resistance
there's some really interesting things that happen number one you get this
massive surge of antioxidant production and defense now antioxidants are things
that help to counter free radicals a free radical is an atom with an unpaired
electrons now normally you have two electrons to balance this atom as it's
spinning and if you actually have only one it's
to create an unstable effect and it's gonna create more damage in the body and
the theory is that if you take an antioxidant it lends an electron to this
atom and it stabilizes it now when we're talking about antioxidants we're talking
about vitamin A vitamin C vitamin E and these antioxidants come in networks okay
so when one vitamin donates an electron it becomes unstable and it has to get
electron from another antioxidant so that's why they come in networks they
actually share electrons back and forth so you get antioxidants from the
environment and you also make any accidents so your body has the ability
to generate antioxidants and one of the triggers for this is called beta hydroxy
butyrate which basically is a ketone okay so ketones trigger this effect what
happens when you're generating all these antioxidants is you're creating an
enhanced resistance to oxidative stress now oxidation from all the glucose and
the high levels of insulin basically corrode out your kidneys your eyes the
inside of your arteries your nervous system your brain so generating ketones
and doing an amine fasting basically resists chronic disease because most
chronic disease stems from oxidative stress and a lot of the damage takes
place in your cellular factories are called mitochondria which is the energy
factor of the cell so doing quito and if' enhance the mitochondrial function
now ketones don't just act as an alternative fuel source one function is
they help the mitochondria generate energy and maintain energy during the
nutrient deprivation fasting or starving and that function explains why your
energy goes up when you do ketosis in them in the fasting you would think it
would go down because you're not supplying any glucose to the cell but
you're providing a different fuel source but it's causing the mitochondria to
become more efficient with its fuel and you're actually more efficient with
oxygen you're also getting less waste products you have a lot less hydrogen
peroxide waste when that with this system and lastly you have
enhanced nutrient absorption and this is why the requirements for nutrients are
much less when you do internment of fasting in ketosis
you don't need exactly to follow the RDAs you can get by with less nutrients
especially because you're eating less symptoms of adaptation so when you
actually adapting to ketosis a lot of times people have beautifu tigue Kyoto
rash whatever they have all these different symptoms okay so why is that
well there's certain nutrients that are needed for fat oxidation or fat burning
because now you're switching your entire metabolism to burning fat no longer
glucose and you're gonna need certain nutrients that you probably didn't need
when you're burning glucose so the requirement does go up with certain
nutrients but you also need more potassium and magnesium and one of the
reasons is to counter the acid effect that is generated with ketones ketones
generally are acidic so there's an interesting study I'll put a link down
below of children with epilepsy and generating an acidosis effect and adding
in alkaline mineral rich greens to counter that and there's some really
interesting positive effects that happen I'm gonna put a link down below you can
check it out when you do ketosis you're really just cutting your carbs down
right and a lot of times people cut their vegetable carbs out I don't think
you should do that first of all it's not going to affect insulin hardly at all
secondly you're going to get the benefit of these minerals in the large
quantities of vegetables that I recommend and that's definitely going to
not only counter the pH issues to allow things to work a little bit better but
you're going to provide the fiber for the microbes so they can make more B
vitamins and I have noticed when people start adding the vegetables they have
hardly any symptoms of adaptation at all compared with other people that might
have a lot of issues but it's really just a matter of adding in the B
vitamins and the minerals and sea salt to prevent any problems with that
dictation so as you can see the benefits of going on keto and I F go far beyond
just a reduction of sugar and reduction of

so today we're going to talk about blood proteins the proteins in your blood i'm going to try
to make it extremely simple and basic because there's been a lot of questions about what does
high protein or low protein mean in my blood and also high protein in my urine what does that mean
okay so there's two main types of protein in the blood now there's additional ones but the two main
types of protein are number one albumin which represents about 50 to 60 percent
of all your protein in your blood which i'm going to explain what that is in a second
and then antibodies which is the rest of the protein in your blood which but again
these two types of protein represent most the protein in your blood now your liver
makes albumin and the purpose of albumin is to hold the fluid in your blood
so if there's liver damage you're not going to be able to hold the fluid in the blood
so where is it going to go now it's going to go out through the urine but it's also going to go
into your tissues around the cells and we call this edema or swelling in your lower extremities
or your legs it can also go into a sac around your abdominal area and that's called the cities
societies comes from the word that describes a sac that's holding water and this is why when
people have liver damage they tend to get this pot belly so number one albumin holds the fluid
in your blood number two it nourishes your tissues and number three it acts as a transport it helps
to transport hormones like your thyroid hormones electrolytes like calcium potassium and sodium
vitamins certain drugs and fatty acids so you can see that protein is really needed for many
different functions now let's shift gears over to the other type of protein which are
antibodies antibodies are produced by certain immune cells the b cells that help you in
your immunity so they're little y shaped proteins that are like receptors
and they connect with something called an antigen now what is an antigen an antigen is just
simply a piece of a pathogen or some foreign thing in the body that doesn't need to be in the body
so you can look at it like a piece of a virus or a piece of a bacteria so antibodies connect to
antigens and they do four things number one they neutralize it because the danger of a pathogen
like a virus is when it invades the cell it goes underneath the radar and your immune system cannot
detect it anymore so it's very very important to prevent or neutralize that antigen or virus
from entering the cell so your antibodies will neutralize or get stuck to this virus and kind of
leave it out to dry prevent it from doing anything number two antibodies also tag these pathogens
for phagocytosis so the phagocytes can go in there and eat them okay so they help identify the good
guys from the bad guys and number three antibodies are involved in inflammation and helping destroy
pathogens through using inflammation and there's a lot more to that in other videos that i've done
and number four and this is very interesting if the virus has invaded the cell already
the antibody will cause the infected cell to commit suicide so as you can see there's
a lot of different strategies going on and the vital importance of this protein in your blood
so if your protein is high one reason could be an infection okay there's an immune reaction and now
you know a little bit more of what's happening in your body and what it's trying to do it can also
indicate dehydration it can also indicate there's some type of cancer in the white blood cells like
multiple myeloma now having high or low protein in the blood doesn't mean the same thing is happening
in the urine okay because if there's high levels of protein in the urine that usually means
there is kidney damage now there's other reasons as well i just did a video on that now i'm going
to put a link down below it could mean that you're consuming too much protein you did
intense exercise you're taking a certain type of supplement called creatine but kidney damage is at
the top of the list if the kidney is damaged then the filter is damaged and you're not filtering the
blood anymore so you're going to have high protein in the urine and your urine is going to be foamy
now there's something else that's very interesting when a person consumes excess amounts of water
you can also cause higher levels of protein in the urine as well that's not necessarily
pathogenic it's not a kidney problem it's just you're just drinking too much water and then of
course if you're a diabetic you're going to have higher protein in the urine as well because of
the massive destruction of what diabetes does to the filtering unit in your kidney all right
guys so thanks for watching and i hope you now have a great understanding of blood proteins
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

all right guys i'm chipping away at all your questions
on the youtube channel and facebook and this next video is based on a
kind of a comment not a question it's basically a disagreement someone said dr berg you don't
know what you're talking about because our bodies were meant to run on glucose especially the brain
and i wanted to do a video on this topic because i think it's important it is true
that a certain part of your body can only run on glucose okay but a greater portion of your body
can also run on ketones and fatty acids i mean if you just think about this logically
most people in america especially are overweight they're carrying a lot of fat around their body
now the question is what is the purpose of fat is it just an insulator is it just to protect
you against the cold or act as a cushion if you fall down or could it be that that fat that you
have is a fuel storage to survive between meals our bodies only store roughly about 1700 calories
of stored sugar but a thin person has about a hundred thousand calories of stored fat
so based on logics our bodies were meant to run on fat more than glucose but it is true that certain
parts of our body only can live on glucose and that would be the red blood cells your liver
yeah your liver actually cannot run on ketones 30 of your brain especially certain parts of your
pituitary and hypothalamus need glucose certain parts of the kidney can only run on glucose and
the lens of the eye needs glucose but here's the key thing there's something called gluconeogenesis
that is a condition where your body is actually making glucose from non-carbohydrate sources
like fat and ketones that's right if your body needs glucose it can make it
from ketones so you do not need from your diet any glucose to survive at all in fact when you start
putting your body into a state of ketosis and you start feeding the brain ketones and your heart
ketones you see all sorts of amazing things that occur improvements in focus memory ability to
learn and your overall mood and just because i'm on the topic of brain physiology there's
a structure in the brain called a hippocampus and that structure if damaged leads to dementia
and alzheimer's and your hippocampus thrives it improves when you feed it ketones and it worsens
when you feed it glucose so both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex thrives on ketones and
this is exactly why when you get into ketosis your focus is better your memory gets better and your
concentration improves and so if you're new to my channel and this is all new to you definitely
watch some videos down below so you can experience the massive benefits before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

let's talk about the absolute best
exercise for
diabetes as well as pre-diabetes
and insulin resistance okay which is
pretty much
60 to 70 percent of the population now
there's two types of exercise you have
aerobic and you have anaerobic
aerobic means with oxygen and anaerobic
means without oxygen so
aerobic exercise would be more slower
type workouts
like walking and yoga that you basically
can talk to someone while you're
exercising because you can breathe at
the same time
whereas anaerobic is without oxygen so
it's more high intense
it's shorter it's more difficult to talk
to someone while you're working out
so some examples of anaerobic exercise
would be
high intense short bursts of exercise
with a good amount of rest back and
forth because you're tapping into
certain energy sources from your muscles
to provide fuel and apparently you don't
need oxygen
to have this happen like in your car you
have a carburetor you have oxygen that's
put in there with the fuel and it mixes
with the spark plug
well when you run your body on an
anaerobic system you don't need oxygen
the problem is you can't go very far so
we have aerobic and we have anaerobic
now with aerobic exercise the first
20 minutes you're burning up your stored
glycogen your stored sugar
and then after that your body starts
tapping into fat but with anaerobic you
are burning your sugar but you have this
delayed effect with fat burning that
occurs sometimes
24 to 48 hours later when you're
sleeping
so which one is better for diabetes it's
the anaerobic type exercise
especially the high intensity interval
training
and sprinting would fall in that
category now the cool thing about
anaerobic exercise
is you don't have to do a lot of it to
create the benefits
but the drawback is it's it's very
uncomfortable and it's sometimes painful
because you're putting more effort into
it but here are two
huge advantages doing anaerobic exercise
and of course i always recommend doing
both
because aerobic exercise is great for
reducing stress
and helping you sleep but anaerobic
exercise is the thing that will spike
your
growth hormone the most and so using
anaerobic exercise correctly you can
spike growth hormone by
700 more than you would if you did
aerobic exercise
and growth hormone is the main fat
burning hormone it's the anti-aging
hormone
it's the hormone that occurs when you're
sleeping in the repair process
and based on the study then i'm going to
put the link down below
you get an increase in insulin
sensitivity by 23 more when you do
anaerobic
versus doing aerobic so basically when
you're doing anaerobic
you are improving your insulin
connecting to the receptor
you're getting rid of your insulin
resistance more than if you were doing
lower type exercises so if you're just
starting keto and it's taking you a long
time to adapt
or you're pre-diabetic or you're a
diabetic
in type 1 or type 2 or you have this big
problem with your metabolism where it's
really really stuck
adding anaerobic exercise to your plan
can
speed things up hey before you go
if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would
love to hear about your success story

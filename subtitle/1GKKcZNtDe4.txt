so i have a question what do you think would happen to your body if you actually
did not sleep for 72 hours let's talk about it well at 24 hours of no sleep you're going
to feel a lot of drowsiness you're going to feel irritable you're going to have impaired judgment
it's going to affect your memory you're going to have more muscle tension more
stress and you're actually going to be at risk for accidents if you're driving okay now at 36 hours
your cortisol is going to go up which is going to release a lot of sugar in your body and your liver
which is going to affect your insulin so your cortisol is going to go up your insulin's going to
go up but your growth hormone is going to go down and that's directly related to your ability to
repair muscle and also repair all your proteins in your body and also lose weight so growth hormone
is like the anti-aging hormone so you might age faster than you should your appetite will go up
i've noticed this if i don't get enough sleep like i'm hungrier your metabolism will go down
i've seen this with a lot of people who are trying to lose weight but they're not sleeping
well your metabolism goes down when you're not sleeping moodiness okay higher stress levels
you're going to be extremely tired hormonal imbalance poor reasoning decreased motivation
and so if you have poor reasoning or you feel like you don't have enough more motivation or you're
tired it could be that you're just not getting the quality of sleep okay because it's not just
the um the quantity of sleep it's the quality of sleep so if you have any of these symptoms
you want to watch my videos on increasing the quality of your sleep okay at 48 hours two days
staying up not sleeping you your body might be um shutting down periodically at for 30 seconds
just to get what's called a micro sleep now when i was in basic training fort jackson south carolina
when i was in the military i literally fell asleep standing in line i was so
so tired and i didn't even know what happened i just kind of went out and then went back
in this could be very dangerous if you're driving right you just kind of go unconscious
and when you wake up you're confused and you're disoriented
not very healthy at 48 hours of no sleep your immune system is going to greatly suffer your
natural killer cells part of the immune cells are going to go down so you're not going to be
able to fight cancer you're not going to be able to kill viruses so it makes you very susceptible
to getting sick all right at 72 hours you're going to have a profound inability to think you're not
going to be able to have good judgment in fact anytime you're tired you shouldn't make any
very important decisions okay you're not gonna be able to pay attention so that's
gonna affect your relationships you might get in fights more with your partner or your spouse
you're not gonna be able to remember details too well you're not gonna be able to finish
projects you're going to be very dispersed very irritated you might even have illusions
or altered perceptions so this video is just to point out how important sleep is and there are

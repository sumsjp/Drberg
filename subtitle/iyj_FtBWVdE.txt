let's talk about how to boost serotonin the happy hormone what is serotonin and what does it do
well it's a hormone a hormone is a communication that travels through the body and serotonin is
made by your brain it's made by your gut and it contributes to feelings of happiness it
helps raise your mood it helps make you calm it decreases cravings for carbs it helps you focus
and it reduces anxiety now if you're deficient in serotonin your mood might be
suppressed okay you may have depression you may have anxiety you may be irritable
you may even have a worse in self-esteem sleeping problems and even memory loss so what can you do
to boost your serotonin number one i'll tryptophan it's an amino acid non-toxic it converts
to serotonin and it can help build up your serotonin levels now just make sure if you're
taking l-tryptophan make sure you take it on an empty stomach now tryptophan also helps you
with sleep so i would recommend taking it right before you go to bed on an empty stomach because
if you take it with protein the other protein will compete with the tryptophan and it won't go in so
it'll be kind of like a waste of taking tryptophan number two exercise exercise helps the conversion
going from tryptophan to serotonin okay number three sun and vitamin d vitamin d
not only is necessary for making serotonin but also to help convert tryptophan to serotonin and
this is probably why vitamin d has anti-depressive properties all right number four probiotics well
your gut makes serotonin a lot of it and there's a huge relationship between what's
going on in your gut and what's going on in your head but probiotics can help increase tryptophan
especially like kimchi sauerkraut these are fermented vegetables and maybe even
kefir or other probiotic type supplements all right number five massage also increases
serotonin and decreases cortisol and just so you know anything that raises cortisol will inhibit
serotonin so you have to keep your stress as low as you can all right number six surprise
fasting fasting significantly increases serotonin this is probably why people that do fasting are no
longer depressed all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

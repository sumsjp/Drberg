ridding old bad habits part three if you haven't seen my other videos on that i put the link down
below all right we're at the stage now where we are ready to create healthy new
habits okay this is what we want to do right here and the key word is create you have to
constantly create these new habits for it to become a new habit we have the bad habits but
now we're creating some new ones and it takes some time so they have to be continued every single day
so whether you know it or not you're doing two things all day long you're creating your health
or you're destroying your health now when you're doing nothing like let's say you're not exercising
at all the health tends to diminish so it's a constant thing where you have to exert effort
to build something up especially with exercise so let's start over here in the creation of your
health couple things make it easy in yourself don't make the recipes complex i'm releasing a
ton of new recipes with only four ingredients or less so that will help you out i'll put some links
down below of where to find these recipes i'm also going to give you a really nice document
that includes all the foods that are keto friendly at the grocery store you know
quick meals that you can go there and just buy already made so you can take those home
and eat them to make it easy also i'm creating recipes with a lot of variety
as well as keto desserts like how to make certain things with chocolate or cookies
how to make different types of bread with very few ingredients so this will make it
very pleasurable yet easy for you to make this transition to your new habits another thing
that's very very important to curb the cravings for carbs or the temptation for carbs is to eat
more fat at the meal because we don't want you snacking especially late at night so a good
habit would be to have enough fat and not snack complete your meal at the meal and don't extend it
there's a lot of people that have supper that turns into a very long meal where they
keep eating until they go to bed we want to break that habit it's not a good one
also not having any junk in the house i will tell you if i had potato chips in my house
i probably would start consuming them i just don't have them in the house i don't want that
temptation so get the junk out of your house all right next one less restaurant foods i think it's
a really good experiment sometimes to just notice how you feel the day after you go to a restaurant
usually despite how much you spend you feel kind of either bloated or you feel kind of tired
because you never can control the ingredients a lot of times they have hidden ingredients like
in the soups and the dressings that are sugary that have refined carb corn starch so try not
to go to restaurants very often okay but i do understand in the beginning you may need to do
what's called dirty keto and not worry about the quality because you're starting new and it's too
overwhelming so it's much better to just go to a restaurant even if it's a fast food restaurant
to you know eat something without the bun or have a somewhat keto friendly not necessarily worrying
about the ingredients but you're just trying to keep your carbs low as a first step now i'm going
to put a link down below that you can get more information on this dirty keto in other words
what types of meals that you should be eating if you decide to do fast food versus meals that
you shouldn't be eating okay so we'll give you some ideas on that if you if you need to do that
next point is awareness when you go through stress you kind of go into this mode where
you're not yourself and you'll do things that you normally don't do especially as it relates to food
certain people when stressed go right for junk food okay so you're gonna have to keep your
awareness very very high when you're stressed and do the right thing by taking certain b vitamins
maybe having a healthy keto dessert to counter the stress and actually get rid of the stress i have
a lot of tips for this boredom the same thing boredom is actually even worse sometimes than
stress because you're you have to keep yourself really really busy people tend to eat when they're
bored so this is all about just being aware that you have this new habit that you're trying to
keep implemented okay next point is this right here never never never never ask this question
to yourself hmm what am i in the mood for today because you're always going to get the
wrong answer i mean i think you have you know the instant gratification of some junk food and then
you have the wonderful healthy feeling that you would consume when you eat something that might
not give you any instant gratification it might in fact be very bitter vegetables are very bitter
but one of the reasons why i consume them is i like the way i feel after i eat them so focus on
the healthy feeling that you're going to get by doing this okay also when you go to a restaurant
if you do go to a restaurant make sure you tell the person serving you don't bring the bread
or the dessert menu okay and that way you're not tempted all right on this side over here
you want to make sure you don't allow yourself to be tempted you want to make sure that the
environment that you're in is uh safe it's keto friendly especially if there's a social
situation with people around and there's all these this junk food just avoid that environment okay
be very selective of what environment that you put yourself in also realize that that little
keto friendly snack that you eat between the meal is going to make you hungry and it's
going to make you want to eat more frequently not a good idea i'll take all these keto snack
foods and i'll actually eat them at the meal but not between the meal
and um i also don't recommend a cheat day okay i'm sorry but i know other programs have a cheat day
the problem is the cheat day turns into another cheat day which turns into another cheat day
ideally though you want to do this to the point where you create a very
large health reserve because the overall strategy is to do this correctly so you drop insulin which
you then fix your slow metabolism this is how you build up your health so you actually could afford
a cheat day here and there because you have this extra health reserve but not in the beginning all
right there you have it thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

hey guys i wanted to create um a quick
video on my electrolyte powder
and one very important specific point
about this
a lot of you are doing keto a lot of you
are on the electrolyte powder
and what i wanted to mention is that
this product is not a
sodium replacement product what does
that mean it means that if you're doing
exercise
you're going to be losing mainly sodium
some of the other electrolytes too but
mainly a loss of sodium
for example a professional football
player could potentially lose
up to six grams of sodium
from all their sweat in one hour okay
take a look at how much sodium that's in
my product 10 milligrams
6 grams is 6 000 milligrams
my product only has 10 milligrams
the average rda for sodium is 2300
milligrams
so the point i'm trying to make is that
if you're exercising
okay and you're sweating a lot and you
take these electrolytes and you're
thinking you're going to replace all
your electrolytes
you may end up with a sodium deficiency
and these are some of the symptoms
muscle weakness
fatigue brain fog maybe a muscle cramp
salt cravings or even headaches so
taking this product assumes
that you're already taking enough salt
especially if you're doing
keto in imminent fasting you need about
one
at least one teaspoon of sea salt
per day and if you're exercising you're
going to need a lot more
depending on your activity and how much
you sweat i created this product
based on what most people are deficient
in potassium
and magnesium and they usually have way
too much sodium
however if you're on keto and you're
coming off the carbs
and you're doing a minute fasting and
you're exercising you're going to have
to also emphasize
sea salt so you don't end up with these
symptoms right here and one last point
potassium and sodium work together so if
you're already deficient in sodium
taking more potassium
could throw off your ratios so the
sodium deficiency then becomes
magnified so the simple solution is just
to make sure you always have enough salt
and it all is based on this right here
all right thanks for watching

Let's cover how to do the best morning
stretches for beginners. This video is
designed to do as a routine thing each
morning until you include it as part of
your new lifestyle habit. This first
video, you're going to stretch and
strengthen your lower back muscles.
You're going to need something that you
can put your hand on so you can find
something around in your room and just
follow along.

>> Now you're going to get on all fours and
do the cat cow pose or stretch. In this
maneuver, you're going to be stretching
your midback, your thoracic spine. This
exercise right here is going to help
maintain an erect posture through the
entire day so you don't end up like this
as you age.

>> This exercise could be done sitting on a
chair. chair or some type of platform
and you're going to stretch forward and
really take all the slack and tension
out of the upper back and especially the
lower back. Since we're stretching out
the lower back and part of the hips,
let's do a full hip stretch using this
method right here.

This next stretch is called puppy pose
on the wall. This is one of my favorite
stretches because you're not just
stretching all the front part of the
body, but also the shoulders as well.

>> This next one kind of piggybacks on The
last one, it's called half down dog,
which is a version of downward-facing
dog in yoga. And you're going to like
this one, too. It's going to take a lot
of tension out of the upper back and
shoulders.
Now, we're going to reverse the flow to
do an extension exercise. And this
exercise is going to stretch the front
part of your body in the lower part of
the hips like the thigh muscles which
are the flexors and the deep flexor
which is the soass. This is another
favorite one that I love. Let's get into
it.

>> Now, let's go back to the hip and do
what's called a figure four stretch.
>> [music]
[music]
>> This next stretch is called a standing
quad stretch. And the reason I included
this one is mainly for your posture. So
many people have tight flexor muscles.
So this is going to reverse it and make
sure that you have enough space in your
lower pelvis. It's going to also help
your walking as well.
The last stretch, and this is my
favorite one, is now we're going to
actually do a twisting action in your
lower back. A lot of people neglect the
rotational aspect of the lower back, and
for many, this is the antidote to low
back pain. Find a place in the floor and
let's dive right in.
Now, before you click away, do this one
thing right now. I put something
together called my personal daily
routine. The one that actually makes me
feel like I'm 18 years old despite being
60 years old. And I put this all in one
printable page. It's a checklist and
it's 100% free and you can click it in
the download in the description, print
it out, put it on your refrigerator and
follow it every single day. And the last
thing I want to mention is I have
another awesome video on posture with
different exercises. And if you haven't
seen this one, you got to check it out.
I put it up right here. Click it, watch
it.

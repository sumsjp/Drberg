so we want to talk about the six stages of fasting okay all right the first stage is between eight
to 14 hours that's when your blood sugar starts stabilizing you are starting to use up your sugar
in your blood as well as your stored sugar called glycogen that's what happens in the first 8 to 14
hours now at the 10th hour your muscles are using about 50 glucose and 50 fat so you're in the very
start of this transition from going from sugar burning to fat burning all right next one 14
hours to 24 hours the liver is going to be turning your fat into ketones and your cravings are going
to go down your energy is going to go up you're going to start noticing improvements in your mood
less anxiety etc and more cognitive function more focus memory and concentration
all right next stage 24 hours to 36 hours this is where you have a full
keto state you're in fat burning the liver is cranking out ketones
your appetite is pretty much gone you have this drop in ghrelin which is why you have no appetite
and then you also have a spike in something called bdnf that's brain derived neurotrophic
factor where your brain cells are starting to grow you're actually getting new brain cells that's
pretty cool the next stage is the fourth stage and this is between 36 to 48 hours this is when you
get into some serious autophagy but in stage four you're getting a lot of autophagy autophagy is a
a process or a condition where your body is recycling old proteins damaged proteins
microbes in the body and it's recycling them into new proteins so you're you're actually cleaning
the body and your body's becoming very efficient and using some of the old stuff that's not needed
for replacement parts as well as fuel so you're getting a lot of repair happening
a lot of recycling and also when you do autophagy you're actually killing
cancer cells as well that's pretty cool there's also a decrease in oxidative stress
so you know you have pollution you have radiation you have all these things in your environment
that is creating oxidation well when you fast you actually have less of those effects you also
have a decrease in misfolding proteins now what is that that has to do with proteins becoming
denatured or damaged so you can't use them so this happens many times when you're combining a protein
and sugar together or fat and sugar together you're actually getting a lot of damaged proteins
and they kind of clog everything up and it can lead to chronic diseases like alzheimer's and
chronic inflammation and so your body is um kind of cleaning up all these proteins that
are unusable they're just damaged and they just sit there and take up space
also in this phase you're getting more memory improvement okay stage five between 48 to 60
hours at this point your insulin sensitivity is is doing really really good so because you have such
a drop in insulin that insulin resistance problem that you had is going away you're getting a super
boost in normalizing your insulin receptors you're getting more autophagy less inflammation
and you're getting healing from atrophy so let's say you had atrophy because you're menopausal and
it looks like fat but it's really a loss of muscle that's all going to start healing at
this point and you're also getting protein sparing so your body's not going to go after
your muscles as fuel they're being protected okay now where are you getting this protein to help
heal well from the autophagy your body is taking this old damaged protein converting it into new
protein to actually heal atrophy and that's really cool all right stage six between 60 and 72 hours
this is when the immune system really shines you get immune system regeneration you get a spike in
immune stem cells that are undifferentiated cells that don't necessarily have a purpose now they
have a purpose of making new immune cells there was a study in 2014 that that demonstrated that a
72-hour fast led to a near complete rejuvenation of the immune system plus people that were on
chemotherapy had a lot less damage okay so there you have it the six stages of fasting hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on
this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your
immune system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so
you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune
system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

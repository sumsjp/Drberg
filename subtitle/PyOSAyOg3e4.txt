Let's talk about the butter and Egg. Yolk myth now
I know you were taught that you need to stay away from butter and egg yolk because it's going to clog your arteries and
Cause heart attacks, but in fact that's what I was taught [to] but it's not actually true
That's a it's it's it's a myth. Especially if you consume
grass-Fed butter now
There is a vitamin vitamin K that has two different versions you have Vitamin K1 and Vitamin K2
Vitamin K1 is from plant sources and that actually helps you clot, okay?
And that's a good thing because if you didn't have this you would bleed internally
Vitamin K2
Actually has a different function by making bones making strong bones making teeth
[so] it helps transport the calcium deeper into the body so vitamin D. Helps drive the calcium into the blood
Vitamin K2 with the help of other vitamins pushes it into the bone itself
So if you're deficient vitamin 2 you get a higher level of calcium that doesn't make it all the way and you start getting
Calcification of your arteries yeah, that's a deficiency of Vitamin K2
so
Basically the source of Vitamin K1 is from Plants or like spinach and vegetables
But you also have vitamin K2 which doesn't come from vegetables it comes from
The animals that eat the vegetables especially the animals that eat the grass
so
the main two sources of
K2 Are egg, yolk and
Grass-Fed butter, not corn-Fed cows that then make the butter, but cows that actually eat the grass
You can also find Vitamin K2 in goose liver if you can find it
Okay, so that's the that's the benefit of egg. Yolk and butter
I consume a lot of egg yolk, and I've been doing it for 25 years. I eat four eggs every single day
My cholesterol is really good, and I'm very very healthy, so
I
Used to crave butter as a kid I used to [eat] just a whole pound of butter
And I apparently I needed this nutrient to help mobilize my calcium
And younger kids needed to because they require more calcium okay? So then the other thing. I was going to mention about this is that
the Vitamin A in grass-Fed butter is
three times more effective than fish oils yeah, and
the Vitamin D and
Grass-Fed butter is a hundred times more effective
Effective than commercial vitamin D. So that's that's interesting so again
you don't have to be scared about consuming butter and egg yolks anymore because
they're totally safe okay, so I hope that helped and
Start applying this information

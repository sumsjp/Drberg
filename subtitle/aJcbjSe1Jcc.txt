hey guys a lot of times I get asked this question what do I do for ear
infections a very simple $2 solution you can either go to the grocery store or go
to the health food store and what you want to do is you want to buy garlic oil
okay garlic oil and all you do is you take one drop put it in the ear that you
have the infection if it's both you can put it in the other ear and let it kind of
drain in there just a small little drop and then just go to sleep and in the
morning like you're going to feel it feels really good so you can do this
each day for like three days in a row because garlic has an incredible anti
infection anti yeast antimicrobial property that will kill off the bad
stuff but none of the good stuff it's very safe there's no side effects and
especially even if you have itching in the ear from a past infection so I
highly recommend it go ahead and apply this and share your comments below

i was talking with someone about their inflammation in their body recently they
were on ibuprofen and they wanted to know is there any natural ibuprofens out there
and that's the basis of this video extra virgin olive oil you're gonna have to find the real stuff
but there's some great data i'll put the link down below that demonstrates that extra virgin olive
oil specifically this chemical called oleocanthal and this natural chemical in extra virgin olive
oil has a potential to mimic the effects of ibuprofen and this natural anti-inflammatory
chemical and extra virgin olive oil gives you that strong stinging sensation in the back of your
throat okay and if you don't get that sensation when you're consuming olive oil chances are
you don't have the authentic extra virgin olive oil that you should be using because there's so
many versions that are fake out there especially in the u.s now the biochemical effect that this
creates is the inhibition or something that inhibits cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes those are the
enzymes that are creating inflammation so when you inhibit those enzymes you get rid of inflammation
and this chemical in olive oil can mimic ibuprofen which is very very cool of course check with your
doctor before coming off any medications now you would have to consume 50 milligrams that's
a little more than one and a half ounces you can easily put that on your salad every day
and you'll get between 60 to 90 absorption which comes out to about nine milligrams
and i would recommend doing that every day if you have a tendency to get inflammation and of course
as a side note if you're getting inflammation we know you probably have too many carbs in your diet
and if you're new to my channel click the link down below to get the exact diet you need to be on
now one last thing about this natural compound it can help you reduce the formation of beta amyloids
that's the plaquing that develops when you have alzheimer's and this compound has anti-cancer
effects in a variety of cancers while leaving your normal cells alone okay so it's very selective in
targeting cancer cells but not your normal cells and the way they do it is they target something in
the cancer cells called the lysosome which is the garbage disposal and they have enzymes to break
that down so this enzyme prevents the breakdown of waste in a cancer cells so the cancer cell dies
within 30 minutes not to mention other effects that cause the cancer cells to commit suicide
that's called apoptosis so anyway if you have the real extra virgin olive oil and you're putting it
on your salad every day it could have some really cool effects that can help potentially reduce
even the formation of cancer hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

i had a question about liposomal vitamins so let's just talk about exactly what it is and
the pros and cons pros it can greatly increase your absorption by a factor of four to nine
times now liposomal vitamins are vitamins that are packaged in these tiny little nano size
liposomes now liposomes is a spherical or round sac of a phospholipid molecule enclosing something
like a vitamin they can also do it with drugs as well and the purpose is to carry it deeper inside
the body there are three different sizes of this liposome the larger size which is like 500 to 5000
the medium size which should be 200 to 800 and the real small size which should be 20 to 150
which is the highest quality so the smaller size the higher quality
and if you're going to do liposomal vitamins i would make sure it's verified by a lab
using laser dynamic light scattering technique okay because if you don't have it certified
chances are you're not getting the most quality particle size you're going to get larger sized
particles which are lower quality and they're not going to absorb nearly as much now the con is that
if you're getting the higher quality one it's very expensive that's one drawback second
drawback is that your own macrophages which are immune cells that eat different things
they tend to break down these they tend to compete so they can dismantle some of this nutrient
but i think the biggest con is that a lot of times companies use synthetic vitamins so here
you are you have this amazing delivery system to drive in nutrition but what are you driving
in the body a synthetic vitamin especially when you see the liposomal vitamin c that
is using ascorbic acid which is usually from gmo corn and even if it does have the l attached to
it which is the natural version of ascorbic acid you're still just getting one little tiny part of
the vitamin c complex you're not getting the whole complex you're getting one little piece of this
whole very complex structure and a lot of times they'll use it for the b vitamins which again
they're mostly synthetic so you'd want to make sure that they're not synthetic
and so you'd want to call the company and ask for the source material what do they make it out of
and then you might say well it's just natural well you want to know what is the source and they they
won't be able to tell you if it's synthetic a lot of times they'll use b12 which again is synthetic
and then vitamin e it might be natural so if it is natural or they're using a turmeric for example
like an herb that would be fine but anytime you're using synthetic vitamins or fractionated parts of
a vitamin complex even if it's natural i personally don't recommend it all right hope that
clarified what it is thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

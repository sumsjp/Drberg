i want to talk about autophagy and what will trigger autophagy more exercise
or fasting for those of you that are not familiar with autophagy autophagy comes from the word auto
which means self and phagy which means eat so autophagy is not a thing it's a condition and this
condition is the recycling of old worn out cell parts proteins and it's a condition that's very
good for us because it's all about anti-aging and when we age we have a deficiency of autophagy so
it's very important to know how to trigger this condition and also autophagy is very deficient
in chronic disease states okay so what triggers autophagy well it's the suppression of glucose
with the increase of ketones and this is why fasting is probably the most potent thing to
trigger autophagy but exercise can also trigger autophagy why because it forces the body to use up
glucose and it also increases insulin sensitivity because when you exercise you're actually lowering
insulin when insulin becomes too high it knocks you out of autophagy and so if you were to
exercise for example and induce a nice spike in autophagy which can then last from hours to even
days it really all depends on how long you go until you beat something and this is why it's
very beneficial to exercise while you're fasting because now you can get this compounding effect
and so this is why i have to explain the concept and give you additional data because the autophagy
that's created from exercise really depends on the next time you eat now you might have a nice little
acute spike but it might only last for an hour as compared to fasting for 48 hours you are getting
a massive amount of autophagy now the type of exercise is very very important as well
the amount of autophagy you're going to get is going to be related to the intensity
and the amount of volume of exercise that you do so a real small little workout isn't
going to create that much autophagy but if you induce a very strong resistant type
workout with high intensity with a good amount of volume which also includes more stress you're
going to get more autophagy but on the other hand if you do a low intense endurance type
workout let's say you're going to do a jog or a long walk while you're fasting even though that's
not an intense workout that will enhance the autophagy that you're getting while you're fasting
versus if you do a low intensity workout let's say you go for a walk and then you eat right after
you're probably not going to get any autophagy from that and so they did these studies
with mice on a treadmill for 30 minutes and so they found an increase in autophagy from 40 to
50 percent and then when it increased it to 80 minutes there was an increase by a hundred percent
so if you have some um pet hamsters or gerbils or mice definitely put them on this treadmill
every day to make sure that they can experience more autophagy all right there you have it thanks
for watching i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

hey guys it's me again in this video we're gonna talk about how stress
affects your brain now this is interesting because there's a hormone
called cortisol it's triggered by stress and what this hormone does is it it
depletes the brain of oxygen so that can slowly start wearing out the short term
memory like with names and then you'll have problems with forgetting where you
are in time and space like ok where am I going where did I park like locational
issues and then becomes worse and worse than worse that's a high level of stress
that can affect the memory and affect brain problems right but there's
something else that I think that's even more common and it could come from
cortisol cortisol releases a lot of insulin and it's behind a lot of
diabetes so insulin resistance is a condition of pre-diabetes so what is
insulin resistance it's basically the insulin is too high for too long and it
blocks the the absorption into the salves into the brain so the situation
where you can't get glucose into the brain anymore you can't get feel to the
brain you can't get nutrition in the brain what do you think the brain is
gonna do you're gonna get brain fog you're gonna memory problems and you're
going to get dimension dementia or Alzheimer's I believe this is my
personal opinion that Alzheimer's is really a severe case of an insulin
problem whether it's insulin resistance or a full-blown diabetes even call it
type 3 diabetes in fact if you type on Google you can pause this video and type
on Google just type on Alzheimer's and insulin resistance and see what pops up
because it really makes a lot of sense when you think about it because that
brain is being starved of food coming from thence and resistance so how do you
fix that well before I get into how to fix it and
I have a lot of videos on that you can watch think about after a Thanksgiving
meal where you eat all this food and you get you get really tired in your head
that's high sugar right because the insulin is not there to pull it out so
that could be one situation as well or if the sugar goes low you could have
like hyper irritability and get very cranky so when you're running on sugar
the fluctuations of high and low or even insulin resistance really messes with
your brain your brain does not do good if there's fluctuations and too much
sugar or not enough sugar okay that's why ketosis is a better way to go
but the thing to do is to heal the insulin dysfunction okay how do we do it
we have to cut out the sugar okay and I'm just going to summarize here but you
can go to other videos you have to cut out the sugar we have to somehow fix
what's causing the insulin going up like high levels of stress we have to fix the
stress we have to get you to sleeping at night we we can't have six meals a day
we can't have snacks between them now so we need three meals a day maybe even
twice if you're not hungry in the morning skip breakfast okay so why
because if we don't eat we we lower insulin between the meals so we cut off
the sugar with three meals a day we don't snack okay and what gets you to
go from one meal to the next is a little bit more fat will not hurt you
it'll help you so of course we need a lot of vegetables as well for the
potassium to help store your sugar between meals and also you need the
nutrition to actually support the whole body in general but these are the
two hormones that are involved with with cognitive function and it's if you can
improve these you'll see great improvements in the brain itself okay
thanks for watching I will see you in the next video

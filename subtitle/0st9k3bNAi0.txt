ok so now we're going to talk about another strategy that we're going to use
in helping you of course you started there you're going
to start the eating plan but there's something you have to realize if you're
trying to lose weight there are other things that are going to slow you down
and act as barriers and we must address them so whichever one you have you're
going to watch that specific video so we can fix it
so what will stop you from losing weight that goes beyond the eating plan is the
sleep if you're not sleeping you're not going to lose weight it's not going to
happen because you burn all the fat when you're sleeping and then when you watch
that video we're going to talk about the underlying causes of lack of sleep it
could be the adrenal gland it could be sleep apnea which you're missing certain
nutrients that the swelling is going on your nose that you can't breathe that
night there's mineral deficiencies there's all sorts of causes to sleep but
that's one big barrier also digestion if your digestion is off if you have a
constipation if you get bloating if you feel very full all the time or you have
a swollen stomach we have to fix that because it's not going you're not going
to lose weight it's going to also interfere your ability to sleep so
digestion is very important to use that as an indicator that know that it's
working energy level you think you're really
going to lose weight if you're tired and you're fatigued now a lot of energy
problems come from sleep issues but it can also come from a thyroid issue it
can come from anemia you don't have enough iron in your blood it can come
from a lot of different sources so in the video and energy if you have fatigue
watch that one you will actually address that menstrual cycle if your menstrual
cycle is off you're gonna have a hard time losing weight why because that
means your estrogen off and estrogen makes fat so we want that estrogen to be
at the right level so it doesn't interfere with the thyroid and it does
interfere with just making fat generally speaking so we want that menstrual cycle
to be very smooth we want the menopausal symptoms like the hot flashes to be
completely gone again you're having night sweats and hot flashes all night
long it's
if you're asleep you're not gonna lose weight these are just barriers cravings
one way I know that you're burning fat is you crave nothing and you're not so
hungry all the time if you're craving sweets you're burning sugar that's all
that means so we must fix the cravings and we're
gonna do it within the program inflammation that's another barrier that
means that your adrenals aren't strong enough and you have it's it's almost
equivalent to having way too many applications on your desktop computer
and it's running and it's sucking energy from the body and it's making you your
metabolism not work as is good because it draws power from the adrenal glands
okay so we want the adrenal glands to be chilled out and that brings us to the
next thing of stress if the body is stuck in stress mode and it can't relax
and you're trying to sleep and it doesn't let you and your excessive
thinking and all these other things that means the adrenal glands are overloaded
and you have too much body stress we must eliminate that to remove these
barriers to be able to lose the weight again a lot of people focus on diet and
exercise they don't go beyond that to look at the whole picture of the whole
body and to get the person truly healthy I would tell you that if you didn't have
any of these issues you'd be very healthy these are good indicators of
levels of health okay so to be able to get we need to go we're going to handle
these and the way it's going to make it easy for you to lose weight especially
long term

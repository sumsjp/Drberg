hey guys in this video I want to talk about intermittent fasting and the gallbladder okay
is it healthy is it not healthy it's absolutely therapeutic okay let me tell you why simply
because the problem of the gallbladder is that you may get gallstones right gallstones come
from either not enough bile B I L E which is kind of like the the fluid that helps you break down
fats or high insulin okay that's what will cause gall stones so doing it in fasting allows you to
recover the vial it helps you to concentrate the bile because every time you eat you're squeezing
out that gall bladder and you're getting rid of your bile so if you're eating five times a day
you're not only depleting all your bile but you're also raising insulin right so eating less frequent
you don't have to use up all the bile reserve and you allow it to recover and be more concentrated
there by never being deficient not to mention if you add a ketogenic diet into this like you're
doing the meals that you're eating you're having some good healthy fats that will also trigger more
bile release you have enough bile and your gall bladder will be healthy okay so it's a very very
healthy what's not healthy is stuffing yourself after each meal and eating five times a day and
grazing at night and constantly you're eating and you just feel like stuff too congested backing
up to the liver that's not healthy but this is totally healthy thanks for watching sub scribe

Hey guys, it's Dr. Berg here. In this short video, I'm going to discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of juicing wheatgrass or using the powder and when
I'm talking about the powder I'm talking about the wheatgrass juice powder not
the wheatgrass powder okay that would mean we're just taking the juice and
then making it into a powder alright now when you juice there's some great things
that are advantages number one it's alive live enzymes its raw it's fresh
there's no fiber it's 100 percent absorption okay it was just a grass now
it's a juice so one tray of wheatgrass could make six to eight shots of
wheatgrass juice okay the cons are it takes a lot of time
cleaning it takes a lot of time juicing you need to equipment you have to juice
it you have to clean it I'll do a demo in the next part but the cost of the
wheatgrass tray is throughout twenty two to twenty four dollars a tray but you
could grow them yourself and spend a dollar for a pound of seeds and do it
for a lot cheaper but then that's time consuming so this is a lot slower okay
and I used to do this but what I did is I I now I get my own powder and the
powder has some great great advantages because it's also live nothing is heated
over a hundred and six degrees okay so it's the enzymes are virtually it's raw
there's no cleaning no equipment that you need it's 58 to 66 cents per
teaspoon which is equivalent to six to eight to even more shots of wheatgrass I
think it's like up to ten shots of wheatgrass juice okay so you're talking
like twenty two dollars for an example I'm going to show you six six shots of
wheatgrass to sixty six cents for these six shots of wheatgrass because it's so
concentrated
that was good that was a workout
wow that was a lot of work so you have a choice you can do the wheatgrass juice
yourself or you can do a wheatgrass juice powder this is not a wheatgrass
powder it's a wheatgrass juice powder super concentrated one little teaspoon
which is this little scooper is equivalent to eight to ten shots of
wheatgrass dehydrated the company that I had this made from it's called liquid
dry and they nothing is heated over 106 degrees it's grown on an ancient sea
floor bed that's that's kind of long gone and Utah where they can pull all
the trace minerals in there so this is super rich super filled with enzymes and
you just need to add water

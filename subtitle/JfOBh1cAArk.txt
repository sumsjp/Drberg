hey guys in this video I wanted to talk about the side effects of thiazide that's
high blood pressure medication also known as hydrochlorothiazide which is a
diuretic for a high blood pressure and edema it pulls water out of your body
okay but it comes with a package it also pulls your electrolytes specifically
potassium magnesium and other electrolytes okay so here the side
effects hypokalemia now what does that mean that's low potassium in the blood
now just think about it potassium is needed in large quantities
in the diet most people don't even get a trace of what they really need and the
side effects of low potassium are palpitations arrhythmias muscle weakness
cramps arrhythmias okay and the big side effect from hypokalemia is high
blood pressure I'm going to put a link down below you have to check this out so
here we are taking this medication to get rid of high blood pressure but it's
causing high blood pressure potassium relaxes the blood vessels it
called it counteracts the retention of sodium the other side effect is
hyperglycemia you know that is that's diabetes that's a side effect
hyperlipidemia that's high cholesterol here's another one high uric acid that's
gout high calcium low sodium is called hyponatremia when
you're drinking a lot of water sometimes you can develop hyponatremia as well
where you're actually getting rid of all the sodium and you get muscle cramps and
leg weakness your body needs about a thousand
milligrams of sodium every single day so if you're pulling out too much sodium
that can be damaging to the heart as well low magnesium we need electrolytes
to be healthy so a lot of electrolytes will make you tired weak muscle cramps
high blood glucose irregular heartbeat and even high blood pressure so I put a
link down below to show you the potential cause of high blood pressure

so recently had a question from someone that wanted to know my opinion on the
new keto slim fast products ok so let's just go through this the first problem I
have with this company is its ingredients it's just another example
why you always need to read the labels on a lot of the products they have
multiple dextran ok multiple dextran has it on the glycemic
index is a hundred and ten okay that's like I mean table sugar is seventy
multiple duction is a hundred and ten you talk about a massive spike in
insulin and this ingredient is in there keto friendly products so it's going to
raise insulin and on top of that the FDA doesn't even require companies to factor
in the multi dextran sugar into the added sugars okay they also have
dextrose this is a synthetic sugar with a glycemic index of a hundred okay it's
way too high tapioca high insulin spike GMO soy canola oil GMO it has residue of
glyphosate and then the vitamins are all synthetic okay and then for the energy
boosting product they just give you some caffeine so my opinion it's very low
quality as a lot of hidden sugars it's gonna spike insulin I don't believe it's
gonna help you lose weight second thing a lot of products are snack based okay
we're trying to get people do in a minute fasting and they're recommending
chips and bars and energy boosters and things like that which will definitely
keep raising that insulin okay not to mention with these ingredients right
here but probably the third reason and the biggest reason is has to do with
their integrity okay they're still producing the original slimfast which
has 18 grams of sugar and the type of sugar is not even cane sugar it's beet
sugar which is GMO we have a massive epidemic right now with people eating
too much sugar metabolic syndrome obesity pre-diabetes
insulin resistance so the real big question is are they really trying to
people because they had a realization that sugar is dangerous or are they just
tapping into a trending market to make a big profit anyway that's my opinion

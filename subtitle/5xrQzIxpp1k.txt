you know i have a lot of videos on insulin resistance but i just realized
i don't have any videos on the symptoms of insulin resistance so i decided to
do a video on that so let's go through all the symptoms of insulin resistance
which by the way is probably one of the most common problems
on this planet right now i would guess to say that at least
60 to 75 percent of the population has insulin resistance or some form of
it even people that are pre-diabetic and
definitely diabetic also have insulin resistance all right
first symptom is frequent urination at night you have to get up several times a
night which really is going to mess up your
sleep completely unnecessary if you know what to do to
reverse insulin resistance number two frequent
hunger a need for a snack between meals and at night number three the need for a
nap after eating especially after lunch
number four not satisfied after eating you might be
stuffed but there's something missing because when you have insulin resistance
the cells can't pull in nutrition so the cells are
literally starving of nutrients yet you just ate a
big meal number five you crave carbohydrates
in the form of breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes
muffins okay number six you have low endurance when you exercise
and you're tired number seven you have belly fat that's probably one
of the biggest indicators of insulin resistance if you
look down and you cannot see your feet that means you have insulin resistance
oh and by the way there's something called skinny fat where you have
fat around the organs and you don't necessarily see it in the outside
that's definitely an insulin resistant situation too
number eight high cholesterol high triglycerides
low hdl and high ldl number nine high blood pressure the
arteries get stiff number ten a fatty liver
which then spills off and forms fat around the gut
number eleven polycystic ovarian syndrome
when you have insulin resistance you have high insulin high insulin converts
to high androgens it can also create a lessening
of the production of breast milk if you just had a baby
number 12 dark folds on the back of the neck armpits groin
and it could be just a darkened velvet texture type
tissue 13 cysts like in baker's cysts back of the knee could be
anywhere number 14 skin tags 15
high blood glucose now i'm not just talking about extremely high blood sugar
talking about even if the blood sugar is let's say 90 or 100
we want to get 80 or less like when you're doing
fasting or you're doing keto for a period of time and you really
adapted your blood glucose because you're not
eating carbs should go down to 70 60 sometimes
high 50s and if you feel fine it's not hypoglycemia
it's your new normal now also you're going to have high
insulin and this is creating a lot of these problems as well
of course you'd have to test for that the test that you would want to do
is this homa ir you can ask your doctor number
16 inflammation as well as pain and it can be as any type of itis
bursitis tendonitis arthritis stiffness in the joints
and of course pain 17 sleep apnea 18 a slow metabolism
if you have this set point where your body cannot get below a certain
weight we know there's insulin resistance
because high insulin is the switch that keeps you
from burning fat 19 memory problems dementia
20 you're moody irritable grouchy could be depressed as well anxiety
21 loss of muscle mass because your cells can't hold in the amino acids
anymore also you're going to have a loss of
joint tissue collagen that's all protein so your joints will
tend to fall apart 22 you can't absorb nutrients not only
can you not absorb amino acid but you're going to have
difficulty absorbing potassium magnesium vitamin c and vitamin d
23 increase in sympathetic nervous system so
you may find that you're always in a state of flight or fight
just by reversing this is going to calm down
your stress a couple symptoms of this would be a lack of
sleep inability to relax decrease stress tolerance and you get up too fast
and you're dizzy 24. acne which is one of the symptoms of
pcos 25 low testosterone
26 pre-diabetes so if you have pre-diabetes or your diabetic
you have insulin resistance 27 fatty liver 28

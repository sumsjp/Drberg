hey guys in this video we're gonna talk about how to use intermittent fasting as
the quickest way to boost your testosterone levels okay so check this
out in intermittent fasting can increase your testosterone by a hundred and
eighty percent and it does it by triggering the hypothalamus in your
brain which is a very small gland and it does it through a hormone called the
gonadotropic releasing hormone which is released by the hypothalamus
and it kind of goes down to a cascade effect until it eventually increases
testosterone in an obese person this hormone will increase by 26% and another
obese person it'll increase by 67% okay again you don't need to know this you
just need to know that it massively increases testosterone but here's the
thing you also need to know insulin will kill your testosterone levels it just
flattens it and what will increase insulin is eating eating too frequently
carbs alcohol and being fat so in other words the more weight you lose because
you're actually an overweight person has high levels of insulin so a thinner
person has low levels so as you lose weight it'll be easier and easier to
stimulate testosterone so the minimum number of hours that you would need to
start stimulating testosterone would be 16 hours so that's an eight-hour window
of eating in a 16 hour of fasting but if you can go 18 hours 20 hours that would
be even better so that way you have a four hour window of eating and they have
20 hours of fasting that's how you're going to boost your testosterone thanks

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about protein part 2
in the series of 3 videos and this discussion we're going to talk about
protein and starch okay now what is start starch is a a bunch of glucose
molecules stuck together it's basically concentrated sugar okay
and yes it does break down a little slower than actual pure sugar like candy
but still it will raise insulin alright but here's the data when you combine a
protein plus sugar or a protein plus starch which is basically sugar in
Disguise it's kind of a hidden sugar you get an exaggerated spike in insulin more
than if you ate these separately so one of the things you don't want to do is
you don't want to consume animal protein with sugar or starches okay that means
meat and potatoes is not a good idea especially if you want to prevent blood
sugar issues diabetes and even insulin resistance which is a pre-diabetic
situation burger and bun right with the ketchup not a good idea it's going to
really spike insulin meat and rice okay that's a starch burger and fries bad
idea fish and chips not good so what you want to do is you want if you're going
to consume if you're going to consume starches at all which I'm not
recommending but if you're going to do it don't add it with animal protein eat
it by itself because you're going to get this exaggerated effect okay so I just
want to bring up this point that if we were trying to heal the insulin we're
trying to lose weight we're trying to get healthy and all the other bad
effects that come from insulin we want to avoid protein and starches together
or protein and sugar not a good idea now in the next video part 3 we're going to
talk about the relationship between should you consume lean proteins or
fatty proteins stay tuned hey guys thank you so much for watching

let's talk about the vegetables that have the lowest net carb ratio now when
we're talking about net carb we're talking about taking the total carb and
minusing the fiber why do we do that because fiber has a zero effect on
insulin and blood sugars our bodies cannot digest fiber we feed it to our
microbes that then turn it into some some food for our colon cells but fiber
does not affect insulin or blood sugars so you don't have to worry about that
now in this category right here okay these are all the vegetables that have
less than one carb per cup that's pretty low okay beet greens arugula lettuce look
at this point two point four point six bok choy 0.8 chard endive mustard green
spinach sprouts have point one romaine lettuce and watercress okay less than
one carb you're allowed 20 grams per day okay we're not even talking about one
card per cup so sometimes when people do keto they're afraid to eat too many
vegetables because it's carb but look at this if you're consuming these it's
basically insignificant it is not going to stop you from losing weight it
provides other benefits of fiber and nutrients a vitamin C folate a lot of
minerals potassium magnesium things like that then we have the group of
vegetables over here with less than three carbs okay a lot of them are like
one point something and two and this is per cup avocado is two grams of carb per
cup which is kind of like one medium sized avocado asparagus 2.4 celery one
point four chili pepper one point four grams of carb okay and this is net carb
cucumbers 3.0 eggplants 2.3 mushrooms 2.2 pickles 1.9 radish 2.0 zucchini 2.4
cabbages 3.0 so you can see these are pretty low too because we are allowed
20 to 50 grams of carbs so you don't have to worry about gaining weight or
being out of ketosis when you're consuming vegetables in fact I don't
even count them at all because I think they're necessary now let's take the
flip side of that what vegetables have the highest carb okay net carb are
artichokes are 11 grams per cup okay still it's still within the range
pumpkin six point nine rutabaga eight point nine turnip 6.0 tomato four point
eight again this is you really don't have to worry about Tomatoes I mean it's
not that high per cup okay beet is nine it's a little higher but guess what with
the fiber it's still in the range but potato we want to stay away from that
that's 33 okay stay away from potato corn is 21 that's pretty high right but
this is GMO so you want to stay away from that too squash is four point eight
that's fine but look at this peas are 14 it's pretty high so I would say out of
all these vegetables right here peas are probably the ones that you probably
don't want to consume large quantities if you're on keto but still one cup is
14 you'd still be okay if you did that all right so I have a lot of interesting
videos on vegetables if you want to check out some more I put them on the
screen right here

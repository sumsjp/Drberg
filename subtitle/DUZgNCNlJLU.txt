so today we're going to talk about how to increase your blood oxygen levels so when you breathe in
you get oxygen it goes down to the lungs and then gets absorbed in the capillaries exchanging
oxygen for carbon dioxide so as you breathe out you're getting rid of co2 as you breathe in
you're getting oxygen and there's certain oxygen binding proteins in the red blood cells
that are then carried around to the tissues and released and when your oxygen is low in
the blood that's called hypoxemia and there's a real simple test to measure to see if you're low
in oxygen in your blood it's called a pulse oxymeter it's a little thing you can stick on your
finger okay it'll also measure your your pulse rate as well and this helps determine if you're
low or normal normal would normally be between 95 and 100 but when you get down to like 92
90 and below then we have a problem and there's various conditions that can cause low oxygen in
your blood you have post cova 19 okay where it affects your lungs you can have carbon monoxide
poisoning let's say for example you're climbing a mountain and there's high altitudes that can
cause this copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema which is a lung disorder asthma
bronchitis pneumonia and even sleep apnea now the three big symptoms that would also be associated
with low blood oxygen shortness of breath rapid breathing and a faster pulse rate but there are
some natural things you can do the most important nutrient that you need to take if you have low
levels of oxygen is zinc okay zinc increases the carrying capacity of oxygen the next thing
is vitamin e i would highly recommend you don't get the regular tocopherols get the tocotrienol
version the next natural remedy would be lipoic acid another one would be vitamin d3 and lastly
b12 could be the reason why you have low oxygen levels but i would start with one at a time that
way you can really identify what you're deficient in and most likely it's probably going to be zinc
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

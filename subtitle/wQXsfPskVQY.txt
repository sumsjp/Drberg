we're going to talk about the four biggest benefits of pistachios I realize
pistachios aren't really a true nut it's a seed of a fruit but we're going to
talk about it today as an actual nut because that's what people are used to
there's many benefits of pistachios but there's four big ones number one out of
all the nuts and seeds it has some of the lowest amounts of oxalates of any of
the nuts almonds have the most oxalates so if you're sensitive to kidneys
stalin's for example or even arthritis or even oxalates in general you would
want to consume pistachios or if you have a history of kidney stones
pistachio is your go to nut all right number two
very high in potassium we're always trying to get more potassium loaded with
potassium good amount of phosphorus if you've ever heard of something called
ATP that's the energy currency of the body which is made in the mitochondria
that stands for adenosine triphosphate so phosphorus gives you energy
zinc very important in over two to three thousand enzymes so I think there's a
lot I've done tons of videos on that in fact let me just put a link down below
because if you haven't seen some of the videos I've done on zinc this one is
actually like a rock star it's one of the most important minerals that you can
take okay vitamin k1 will help if someone has
excess bleeding b6 very important in a lot of different
biochemical reactions also it can help edema and swelling especially if
someone's pregnant and they're just swelling up with fluid this can help b1
one of my favorite vitamins it reduces anxiety it helps you sleep it helps
excessive thinking all the time 24/7 it's good for stress it's good for a lot
of things and then we have full-length which is not just important in a growing
child to prevent birth defects but it's also important and in dolt to prevent
breaks in your chromosome in your DNA so it helps in the repair process if you
efficient you have all sorts of damage in the DNA vitamin E vitamin E is a
important antioxidant but it does a lot more it's very beneficial for your
muscles for hormones for your endocrine glands and your skin also is vitamin C
and then chlorophyll which is like the green stuff in a plant that's why I
pistachios are green because it has more chlorophyll this is a good healer in
general and also for your inner skin like anything going on like with
irritation on the inside of your esophagus on down through your colon
this is very very important now in the center of chlorophyll you have the
mineral magnesium so pistachios are high in magnesium which is good for a lot of
things not just for muscle cramps and sleeping and stress but also to make
energy and also to help with your heart rhythm because it's one of the key
electrolytes alright number three it's a good source amino acids it's a good
source of healthy fats it does contain an omega-3 fatty acid called ala it does
have to be converted to DHA the active form and EPA but still it has a good
amount of ala which is kind of a precursor to the active forms of omega-3
fatty acids there's a lot of other fatty acids that it has and those are also
good for many different things related to cognitive function cardiovascular
function immune system and the list goes on
also it's very little carb so it's perfect keto higher fat low carb medium
protein and number four antioxidants now your body makes antioxidants you also
get them from your foods and so both of them combined make up your network of
antioxidants to protect you from the environment creating oxidation and free
radicals and also from your own body making free radicals because that's kind
of a byproduct of the metabolic process so antioxidants can greatly reduce the
complications of certain illnesses and like diabetes for example that generates
a lot of free radicals inflammation in general so these are
really good compounds and giving your body additional health benefits that go
beyond just vitamins and minerals it has the carotenes which are pre vitamin A
tocopherols which is part of the vitamin E complex and there's a lot more
as well some that even help with macular degeneration all right there you have it

baked on Lucado
let us tell you a little story of a
church and its cool wife Karen in person
we better be lean Lerner Makita machine
August 2019 is a place of dreams no carb
high fat no carb high fat no carb high
fat moderate protein its mission Alison
our last meal we feel great
ain't no hate rebels dominate let's
celebrate
I know all y'all are jealous all you
unhealthy fellas dr. Burke has swag and
the ain't overzealous that's right
answer your questions we'll give you no
trouble so get in line y'all the doors
will be doubled no carb high fat no carb
high fat no car
high fat moderate protein
[Music]

so today we're going to talk about the sciatic nerve and there's two different
reasons why you would have sciatic nerve pain it's pained on the back of the leg
and it can go all the way down into the foot one is more of a structural problem
where the low back curve is not there and I'll put a couple of videos down
below of a technique to help put the curve back in especially if you're
sitting all day in front of your computer
but there's another underlying cause of sciatic nerve pain that I want to talk
about which is more internal and there's something happening to the nerve itself
and it has to do with an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids omega-3
fatty acids are the anti-inflammatories and omega-6 they're more inflammatory
now we need both of these fats but we need them in the right ratios an average
American is really heavy on the six and very very low on the three they have an
imbalance and that creates a lot of inflammation and nerve pain and it
affects the lipids the myelin sheath around the nervous system but especially
to the sciatic nerve what's unique about the static nervous
it's one of the biggest nerves in the body it's about the width of my thumb so
it's a huge nerve and if you have an imbalance we don't have enough of this
and you have too much of this you can really target this sciatic nerve let me
touch on omega-6 for a little bit it's called Linoleic acid there's a
condition that's called oxidized metabolites of linoleic acid basically
when these fats or their byproducts become oxidized it creates a massive
inflammatory situation in the body in the arteries in your brain and the
nervous system this compound another word for it is oxlam
is the most abundant oxidized fatty acid in your blood in 1909 we consumed
only two grams of vegetable oil which really is the seed oils now or shall I
say about ten years ago in 2010 we were consuming 80 grams of vegetable oil
every single day that is 720 calories if you're consuming about 2,000 calories a
day that's like
one third of all your calories is this type of fat and the problem is that it
makes up your cell membranes so it creates a lot of problems throughout the
entire body and there's a one to two year half-life it doesn't break down
very easily this is what you need to do if you have sciatic nerve pain or any
nerve pain decrease the vegetable oils start to read labels avoid the soy the
canola the corn oil the cottonseed oil even the safflower oil cook with coconut
oil and butter you can totally use olive oil that's a mega 9 it's actually very
very good for you you also want increase your omega-3
fatty acids the fish oils the cod liver oil consume more fish seafood sardines
that's another good one and the last thing I would recommend is to get some
gamma linoleic acid now this is an omega-6 fatty acid but it's more
anti-inflammatory it specifically can increase the blood flow to the nerve
itself as well as increase the nerve transmission there's been some real
interesting nerve conduction velocity testing using this and improving the
conduction of the flow of that nerve and that would be either evening primrose
oil or borage oil give it some time to work and in the
meantime watch my other videos on sciatica I put the link down below

to lowered estrogen which could really affect a woman on many different levels so number one
take vitamin d very simple minimally 10,000 IUs but you may want to take a little bit
more initially and then come down to 10,000 IUs every single day so vitamin d increases serotonin
which brings you up it makes you feel happy so vitamin d number one and number two

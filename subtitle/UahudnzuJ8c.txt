let's talk about the benefits of using salt for your immune system
there's a certain chemical right here it's called hypochlorite that is a
chemical name for bleach i'm not sure you realize this but
two of your immune cells actually make bleach to kill
microbes the neutrophils and the macrophages and both of these
are phagocytes and what does that mean it means
that these cells actually eat bacteria and viruses
and fungus and mold and candida so when they eat the microbe they pull it in
they encapsulate the microbe and they pour in chemicals one of the chemicals
they pour in is bleach and guess how your body makes
bleach from chloride as in sodium chloride
so it comes from salt so if you don't have enough salt in your body
this mechanism or weapon used by these two cells
becomes severely compromised so your defense mechanism is diminished
so hypochlorite bleach is a broad spectrum microbicide which basically
poisons the microbe it'll kill bacteria within milliseconds
and it's much much stronger than another chemical that these guys use
called hydrogen peroxide and as a side note
if these immune cells run into the unfriendly
form of candida they'll start dumping a lot of hypochlorite into the system to
kill the candida and certain reports indicate that it'll
release between 70 and 80 percent of the chloride reserve so they can
actually make more hypochlorite and what's
interesting when i was in practice i noticed that certain people
that came in that had a candida infection or overgrowth of candida
also had a very pungent smell about them which basically was
similar to bleach and that was probably the immune system trying to wipe out the
candida and as a side note if you have candida
the most important thing to do is not to consume
bleach but to consume salt to actually help
your body make more bleach as well as bring your carbs way down
to zero because candida lives on sugars and glucose so now let's talk
about what would cause a deficiency in salt
of course the obvious thing is not consuming enough salt
you need about one to one and a half teaspoons
okay level teaspoons of salt per day if you're not exercising
if you're sweating a lot and you're sweating out electrolytes specifically
sodium or chloride you need more salt now when you do the
ketogenic diet you need more sodium to prevent something called keto
flu now when you're deficient in sodium you
can have a lot of the symptoms that mimic the flu without being the flu
there's no infection involved but a deficiency of sodium will cause
muscle weakness muscle achiness headaches lethargy dizziness
not necessarily mucus but a lot of the other symptoms
and when you actually go from burning sugar to burning
fat and producing ketones you're going to lose a lot of the fluid retention and
with that you lose a lot of sodium now with the
immune system you need the other half of sodium you
need the chlorides i think the chlorides are pretty much
not really emphasized very much we always talk about sodium but i think
this is a very ignored mineral chloride is also needed to make
hydrochloric acid to also kill off pathogens that can come into your
stomach but it's definitely needed for the immune system
to build up phagocytes another way that you can become deficient
in salt is having diarrhea vomiting taking diuretics consuming a lot of
potassium without salt i mean even if you were to
consume 10 cups of vegetables you may find that
you start getting a salt craving so you definitely need the balance of
salt with potassium as well if your adrenals are burnt out you're
going to need a little bit more salt if you drink too much water
you will dilute the body's electrolytes specifically sodium chloride now there's
a condition called hyponatremia which is low sodium
in your blood which usually comes from just drinking like gallons of water
so you want to drink enough but just realize if you drink too much you're
going to deplete your sodium and even chlorides as well if you're
doing some type of endurance exercise running marathon
triathlon things like that you definitely need a lot more
salt now a football player in practice in the summer
could sweat out about six teaspoons of salt in that one workout so the salt
that you need is really dependent on your activity level and how much you
sweat anyway i wanted to talk about the
importance of salt for the immune system as well as preventing the keto flu and
i always recommend when you're taking salt to take sea salt himalayan
sea salt is one of my favorites thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no sugar
totally keto there's no suffering on keto absolutely not Karen
and it's an immune system builder absolutely
you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe
and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy
making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

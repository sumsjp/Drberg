let's talk about the importance of vitamin b6 in females now the big reason why i wanted to do a
video on vitamin b6 in women is because 32 of all women have a vitamin b6 deficiency so i think it's
kind of important to mention it increase awareness on exactly what happens when you're deficient
now vitamin b6 is involved in over 140 different enzyme chemical reactions there's three main
things that it does number one it's involved in protein fat and carbohydrate metabolism and
that's quite extensive number two it's involved in the red blood cell and number three it's essential
for making neurotransmitters and neurotransmitters are those communications that travel through the
nervous system they're hormone-like but hormones travel through the blood neurotransmitters travel
through the nervous system and vitamin b6 also acts as an antioxidant and it can help you as an
anti-inflammatory i think of b6 as that vitamin that is a helper compound that just allows other
chemical reactions to work and so if you're having certain problems trying to fix something
it could be just you need more vitamin b6 because vitamin b6 is involved in so many different
chemical reactions now we normally have hundreds of different microbes in our gut that make the b
vitamins primarily vitamin b2 and vitamin b3 and there's also microbes that make vitamin b6 but
not in large amounts and so if you're not getting it from your diet there's no way you can even get
close to getting it from these microbes now what's interesting about the microbiome is that they need
nutrients to function they need nutrients from your diet and also many of the nutrients that we
need come from the microbiome and so if you're not getting enough nutrients from your diet
that can affect the microbiome and a lack of microbiome can affect the nutrients that actually
they give you now typically vitamin b6 comes from tuna turkey beef chicken salmon sunflower seeds
spinach and there are many other foods as well but let's talk about the symptoms that can occur if
you're b6 deficient and you're female number one pms symptoms i'm talking about anxiety depression
irritability there's one study that showed that when you take b6 you can reduce the symptoms by 69
and even more than that if you add magnesium number two nausea pregnancy that is a b6
deficiency they don't know exactly why but it has something to do with the neurotransmitters
also if you have morning sickness or you're pregnant and you're vomiting b6 is the answer you
want to take 25 milligrams of b6 usually between one or two months if you also add some ginger
that can actually help even more number three breast cancer risk may reduce if you have enough
b6 number four fluid retention b6 can help get rid of excess fluid number five carpal tunnel syndrome
especially if you're pregnant and you have carpal tunnel syndrome you need vitamin b6 all right
there you go that's my summary on vitamin b6 hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

today we're going to talk about some natural beta blockers now what is a beta blocker well a beta
blocker is something that inhibits or blocks beta adrenergic receptors which are certain receptors
for adrenaline so basically it blocks the stress response which is part of the sympathetic nervous
system and doctors prescribe beta blockers for various conditions number one to help slow down
the heartbeat for abnormal heartbeats arrhythmias for high blood pressure for second heart attacks
for angina which is chest pain for essential tremors if your hands are shaking and the word
essential means unknown cause so they don't know what causes this type of tremor also mitral valve
prolapse and a condition called pots where you get dizzy if you stand up
and it's been used for anxiety as well all right so the problem is there are some
side effects from taking a beta blocker so i'm going to talk about some natural beta blockers
which are certain remedies to reduce adrenaline now of course adrenaline is part of the stress
response so anything you can do to reduce stress be a very good thing so the first thing i'm
going to recommend is potassium to increase your potassium potassium is a physiological
tranquilizer it calms the nervous system down number two garlic garlic has properties to
reduce blood pressure and it can also help reduce adrenaline also garlic is loaded with vitamin b1
which is another remedy thiamine b1 is a great natural remedy to help lower the stress response
it can reduce both cortisol and adrenaline then we have magnesium which is another mineral that helps
calm the nervous system and by the way calcium is not something you want to
take if you're trying to lower adrenaline it can increase adrenaline because calcium
is part of the contraction mechanism whereas magnesium is part of the relaxation mechanism
all right the next one is vitamin d vitamin d is really good to help reduce cortisol
as well as adrenaline as part of the stress response and a great herb to take which is an
adaptogen for the adrenals which can help reduce cortisol as well as adrenaline is ashwagandha

hey guys I know the question concerning supplements and intermittent fasting okay what
do I recommend there's a couple things I'm going to recommend probably one of the most important
minerals that you need when you're intermittent fasting not just to prevent issues like with gout
or oxford stones but just because your metabolism is changing from glucose metabolism over to fat
burning or ketosis metabolism you need a lot of potassium okay so potassium is necessary and I
recommend the electrolyte powder simply because it not only has potassium it has all electrolytes has
no maltodextrin it has a thousand milligrams of potassium citrate which is really good to
prevent stones not just aqua stones but uric acid stones that cause gout but it also keep
your energy up so you you're not deficient it's also enhancement if you just can't get all the
vegetables okay so that's one thing and I take it every day I put it in water drink it I might put
some lemon in there then I'll do it like twice a day especially before a workout and it's just very
very hydrating especially if you're doing the intermittent fasting in ketosis you're dumping
all this water you're losing electrolytes sometimes too so you might just need to put
that back okay there's a tiny bit of sodium in there like salt sea salt not much it's heavy on
the potassium and the other minerals and trace minerals so that's one thing I recommend for the
B vitamins I would get a good nutritional yeast that's unfortified okay make sure it's non-gmo
nutritionally you can do brewers yeast too but it's a little bit bitter so nutritional yeast and that
way you can increase the B vitamins B vitamins are necessary to prevent that fatigue or keto flu
or the feeling like feeling kind of heavy with lactic acid like your legs are heavier so that
will actually because what happens is you burn fat you generate a lot of acids so you want to be able
to take these to neutralize the acids and even if you workout and you have a lot of lactic acid the
B vitamins will get rid of excess lactic acid and other assets okay so that's what I recommend for
the B vitamins vitamins in general I basically do the raw wheatgrass juice powder one teaspoon is
equivalent to a tray of wheatgrass it's just the juice without the fiber you can take this when
you're fasting but it's kind of like a coffee substitute it will wake you up it gives you all
the vitamins and minerals it has everything in it so I don't take a multivitamin I take
that as my multivitamin so you can actually take that just to make sure there's nothing
missing and then lastly this is like for people that are really severely insulin resistant or a
diabetic or they just want to enhance the weight loss because it actually has 10 ingredients to
support it's called insulin and glucose support it supports the cells that make insulin it helps
to regulate normal insulin levels and blood sugar levels okay so you that's another one
so anyway put your comments below and thank you so much for watching hi guys thanks so much for
watching press this little button down here it says subscribe and I will make sure that I won't
send more than five to ten videos a day okay no I'm just kidding it'll be one or two thanks

so today we want to talk about the most accurate way to assess your blood
Sugar's okay so we'll talk about a1c by checking your
blood glucose when you're fasting and checking your blood glucose when you're
post-meal I'm not going to actually mention the glucose tolerance test where
you're going to consume actual glucose and then measure your blood sugars
simply because you're never going to consume just pure glucose and your diet
okay so that's not going to really give you an accurate assessment of what's
going on so let's start with a1c okay a 1c is not as accurate as blood glucose
simply because it's not measuring to your blood glucose levels directly it's
giving you a rough estimate of your blood sugars over three months what it's
really measuring is the percent of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose now
hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen in your blood so a1c is the
percentage of how much hemoglobin that's connected to that sugar okay in your
blood now there's other similar measurements
you have A1B A1A1 A1A2 that's not binding to glucose but the
a1c is so this is what they use to assess that now let's talk about anemia
there's a couple different types one is where you have low iron if you have the
type of anemia that is low iron you're gonna have an abnormally high a1c giving
you a false reading with your blood sugars so it's not going to really be as
accurate to actually indicate high blood sugar issues now there's another type of
anemia called hemolytic where you're actually having destruction of the red
blood cells in which case you're going to have a very low A1C you can also have
an infection which control this off you can also have a liver disease or a
kidney disease or even being pregnant and it can throw off this number right
here so we want to just use this as a guideline it's not a bad test but
realize it's not 100% all right now let's just bring up the point what is
normal blood sugar well it should be in the 80s roughly between 70 and 90
milligrams per deciliter but if you are a diabetic you're most likely not going
to this right here at least initially until
you're working on it for many many months even sometimes years because if
you're a diabetic especially you've been a diabetic for a
long time you have insulin resistance and many times you've lost up to 50% of
your beta cells those are the cells that actually make insulin so we're really
dealing with a dysfunctional pancreas and it's gonna be really hard to bring
this down simply because you don't have all the cells that make insulin and this
is gonna leave you with a slightly elevated blood glucose level okay now if
you really work on this and you do in a minute fasting over a period of time I
believe you can bring it down pretty close to a normal level okay here's one
of the challenges that I see with diabetics they're going to their doctor
and the doctor is assessing them and there they might be improving but they
can't seem to get the blood sugar down without a lot of medication okay not to
mention the recommendations that they're giving the person is usually higher
carbohydrate low fat you know type foods so they're never going to be able to get
them even close to normal especially if their carbohydrates in their diet
are just too high so that's one thing but usually diabetics have a lot of
complications they have high blood pressure they have eye problems they
have nerve problems they have heart problems they have cholesterol problems
and they have a fatty liver so they're on a lot of different medications and
the real problem is the side effect from those medications are sometimes worse
than the side effects from the high sugar okay now if you are a diabetic and
you do the keto plan and you're doing in a minute fasting and you're doing great
but you can't seem to get this down to where it needs to be and it's it's
higher just realize you can do certain things to neutralize and minimize the
complications of that high sugar okay and you can do it with high nutrient
dense foods okay that's why it's so important when you do a healthy keto
plan make sure those foods are high quality
having enough vitamin A vitamin C from food b1 vitamin e vital okay those are
all antioxidants that are really really important especially about mb1 if you
have enough b1 and get it from nutritional yeast or a natural source
even if you have high sugar the complications will be very minimal okay
so that's what you want to do if your dad better kind of got diverted there a
little bit okay so let's go to the next test fasting blood glucose level this is
not a bad test it'll give you some data and of course normal would be like 80
okay really roughly between 70 and 90 but when it gets above 110 milligrams
per deciliter that's when you start to have problems okay start do you have
damage to the cells of the pancreas or call beta cells it's at 110 when you
start getting above 140 you start to have more problems with the other
tissues like the heart especially the inside of your arteries okay you start
getting inflammatory conditions the kidney the nerves the fingertips and the
bottom of the feet and the brain okay so so if you get your test back and it's
above 140 then we know what's happening with this okay but again if you're a
diabetic okay and you're on keto and you're doing really good it might be
really hard to even get it down here at least initially but that's okay if you
keep eating really healthy you'll be protected now the absolute best and most
accurate way to assess your blood Sugar's is post meal okay one to two
hours this gives you the dynamics of how your pancreas releases insulin to push
those blood sugars down normal after one to two hours should be 120 or less and
then eventually at two hours it should be below a hundred okay so anything
above that would be a problem so this right here is rarely talked about it's
it's really assessed now if you have a blood glucose meter I would highly
recommend focusing on this assessment right here
and your method of knowing your blood sugars are in check alright thanks for
watching so if you've personally benefited from
the information that I put on my videos I would love to actually see your
success story - I put a link down below so you can upload your before and after

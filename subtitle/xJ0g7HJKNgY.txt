so i'm going to talk about why lemon water is essential if you're doing
fasting and the ketogenic diet now
typically when you think of lemons you think of acid right
citric acid and lemon juice and lemons are really good to decrease the risk of
kidney stones because they help bind with oxalates okay and most kidney
stones are calcium oxalate stones there is some
vitamin c in lemons okay but not if it's in a jar and it's
pasteurized because the heat destroys the vitamin c
the other side note that you need to know is that
any time you consume vitamin c in your body or any food with vitamin c
and at the same time you're consuming sugar
what's going to happen is your body is going to absorb
the sugar but not the vitamin c because their chemistry is very similar
the body will always absorb sugar before vitamin c
and i can think of like lemonade for example where
people take the lemons and all the sugar they're thinking oh yeah i'm gonna
get some vitamin c no they're not okay so
there's some other benefits of lemon juice or
lemons and you could use the juice of one lemon which is one ounce of lemon
juice or just lemon juice for what i'm going to recommend now
what's interesting about citrus in general
and lemon juice or lime juice is that after you consume it
within one hour that acid turns to an alkaline substance it turns
alkaline so lemons are good for people
that have acidosis where their ph is slightly too acidic okay that means
the ph has dropped down now normally the blood ph should be
between 7.35 and 7.45
okay now anything above 7 more alkaline so the blood is naturally
alkaline but if it goes below this 7.35
you start developing a condition called acidosis now here are the symptoms for
acidosis shortness of breath your breathing is
affected labored breathing deep breathing
headaches because you're actually getting
too much co2 you're tired confusion tremors sleepy
arrhythmias increase heart rate okay so these are all the symptoms of
acidosis what's interesting about that is there's
this concept that if you're too acid you're always unhealthy we need to
alkalize the body okay alkalizing the body for every
condition is a good thing uh including cancer but that's actually
not true you don't want to be too alkaline
you don't want to be too acid you want to be exactly right where you
should be but in this video i wanted to talk about the symptoms of being too
acidic and what causes that and the remedy
would be lemon juice and you can put in your water so what
causes our bodies to become too acidic keto
and fasting could do it now if your body is healthy you're not going
to develop acidosis okay from this right here but ketones in
general are acidic and when you do a ketogenic
diet low carb and you do fasting you're going to have more ketones you
might have more acid in the body and so drinking lemon juice can help
reduce some of the excess acidity if your kidneys are damaged you can
develop acidosis if you have too much iron you can have
too much acidosis alcohol will put you in a state
of acidosis and then you have a condition called lactic acidosis
i've done some videos on this i'll put the links down below
but this occurs when you consume metformin which is a medication for
diabetes one of the side effects would be lactic acidosis
but really this mainly occurs if you are b1 deficient
if you're consuming a lot of carbs that's going to deplete b1
or refined grains especially so if you have acidosis taking b1 can
greatly help that now ketoacidosis is very rare
this only occurs if you're a type 1 diabetic and you fail to take your
insulin so i mean taking lemon water is not
going to create a big change for this if you're interested in
more information i put a link down on this but
this is very rare and this is not going to happen to anyone who is
healthy so if you do a keto diet or fasting you're not going to develop this
unless you're a type 1 diabetic and you fail to take your insulin it delivers
damage you can actually go into acidosis from
that excess exercise can also put you in a state of
acidosis now there's other things that can do it too for example
if you're consuming a tremendous amount of apple cider vinegar or
you do kombucha tea like uh in the past i remember drinking a whole bottle of
kombucha tea very very acidic and i definitely went
into a state of acidosis because my heart rate
started going very very high just pounding and pounding and pounding
and i had some of these symptoms my breathing was off
i couldn't sleep at night so what i did is i drank some lemon juice
okay bam handle it so realize that the lemon
turns alkaline after about an hour and it'll start to adjust your ph
that way there's certain conditions that will cause this
and there's certain conditions that will cause this
and you want to be right in the middle right here if you're doing fasting
if you're doing keto i would recommend to do this even while you're fasting
take some lemon maybe about one ounce put that
in water drink that down and that way you can help minimize
this condition right here and some of these symptoms
thanks for watching hey we're back with another amazing
recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there's no
suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder

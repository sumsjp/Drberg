i've done a lot of videos on the toxic effect of alcohol on the liver but i
haven't done a video showing the effects of alcohol
on the heart tissue so let's talk about that
there is a condition called alcoholic heart
muscle disease where the heart becomes very dysfunctional because of the
chronic use of alcohol but alcohol in general will
create several problems with the heart tissue
one is it causes an increase of acetyl aldehyde accumulation now
i've done videos on this on the liver and this chemical is considered a toxin
or a poison it's responsible for that the feeling of
a hangover and the body will try to use certain enzymes to get rid of this
toxin well the same enzymes in the heart also are trying to get rid of this
toxic poison which is a residue from the alcohol
also you'll get a decreased protein synthesis on the myocytes so the heart
cell is made out of muscle and it needs
protein to rejuvenate so you're not going to get
a nice turnover of heart cells dilated chambers so you have different
parts of the heart okay you have four chambers and these
chambers as they start to enlarge they don't all enlarge on a symmetry
basis like the right side might enlarge more than the left and
that creates all sorts of problems it can also create arrhythmia
problems and murmurs because now as the heart
is enlarged the valves no longer close like they're supposed to
also there's going to be increased inflammation in the heart
which really leads to a lot of problems with calcium buildup cholesterol buildup
fibrosis of the heart tissue arrhythmias and then we have another effect of a
decreased ejection fraction and a decreased contractibility so this
contraction of the pump which is supposed to push
the blood throughout the body is impaired we also get a decrease of
anti-apoptosis pathways now what does that mean there
are certain pathways that are there to help the survival of the heart muscle
cell called the myocyte apoptosis is where the cell actually
dies so we have anti heart muscle cell death
right so with alcohol you are going to decrease
the effect of this protective mechanism and you'll have more heart cells that
die and then we get an increase of calcium
that accumulates inside the cells now normally we're supposed to have this
ratio of way more calcium outside the cell
than inside the cell we do need calcium inside the cell but
that is very very tightly regulated and
calcium acts as a communication particle in and out of the cell
one of the problems with alcohol is it drives too much calcium inside the cell
and you have all sorts of issues and there's quite a few other things
that will drive calcium inside the cell too like emf electromagnetic fields
a problem with low potassium because potassium protects
this calcium overload and what happens then is you'll start getting arrhythmias
and palpitations and all sorts of problems
with the pacemaker of the heart now i know some of you are
going to ask about what about a little bit of wine each day i heard
that was good for the heart because of the phytonutrients the
antioxidants the phenols right well yes that is correct but it's the
exposure to ethanol that's the problem if you were to consume a half a cup of
wine that may create a little bit of what's called a hormetic effect which
will add a little stress to cause the body to
rebound and it you might see positive changes but
who's going to stop at a half a glass of wine per night
probably not very many people but i will say if you're going to drink some wine
occasionally and you want it to create more recovery there are certain things
that the heart loves and the biggest thing that it loves is
ketones fat the heart prefers fat fuel way over
glucose fuel and that would be the healthy keto
and the intermittent fasting for sure as a way to recover the damage that alcohol
could create the other two things that the heart
loves our omega-3 fatty acids okay
and vitamin e make sure the vitamin e includes tocatrinos not just
a synthetic tocopherol all right thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up
watch the recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy
making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

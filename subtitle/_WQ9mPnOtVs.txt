all right costochondritis what is it and how do you get rid of it 30% of emergency room chest pain
related visits is costochondritis it's a chest wall pain it's also called costosternal syndrome
because there's pain or pain and tenderness upon palpation when you palpate the connection between
your ribs and your sternum so costo ribs chondro is cartilage right here that's connected to the
sternum and basically when you're pressing right through here you feel pain or you just
have pain in this area right through in here or this side right here now if you look this
up medically they don't really know what causes it in most cases they can't find a cause identified
unless there's some trauma but what if there's no trauma and let's say there's
no lung infection you don't have pneumonia and you don't have shingles what could be behind this
there's two things one is you could be blowing vitamin d low vitamin d will cause bone pain
as a major symptom probably one of the first symptoms so if you press on your bone either
your shin or the sternum or right next to it and it's painful you might just need some vitamin d or
the second most common cause is a problem with something just behind the rib cage
and what do you have behind the rib cage well you have the liver and the liver is connected to the
gallbladder through a little tube and let's say that the liver or the gallbladder is backed up
and there's pressure or it's becoming enlarged that will most definitely cause pain
right on the top part where the ribs are in fact when i was in practice almost a hundred percent of
the time people came in with costochondritis had it on the right side which correlates with the
liver being on the right side and inevitably they had a lot of digestive issues as well bloating
and things that are related to that so i'm just increasing awareness on other potential causes
other than well you know we don't know what causes it just takes the medication now if it's
on the left side that potentially could relate to your heart but let's say you you get that
checked out and it's not connected to your heart your heart's healthy but guess what on the left
side you have the pancreas you have a lot of ducts that work together with the ducts of your pancreas
and so both the left side and the right side could be related easily to some problem with your
digestion and it could be some type of gallbladder sludge that is backing up these these ducts or
little tubes which will create pressure and pain the simple solution if that's the real cause is
to take some betaine hydrochloride i would take maybe three four or five right before you eat you
can get it from the healthy store very simple safe solution in addition to some purified bile salts
okay and you would take this probably on an empty stomach in the morning and then take
one or two after lunch and then take maybe one in the afternoon and what that will do is thin
the bile sludge to allow for better drainage and ease the pressure and reduce this pain
right here it works like a charm definitely want to check it out i put some links down below for
more information on both of these but of course check with your doctor before taking anything new
and definitely rule out other problems like heart issues before you kind of self-diagnose but mainly
what i'm talking about uh if all these other things are absent and you can't find anything
definitely these are the two things i would look at before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

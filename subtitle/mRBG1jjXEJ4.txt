now zinc does so many things it's involved in over 300
different pathways but recently i found out that zinc has an unexpected sleep benefit
typically when you think of a zinc deficiency you think of a child not growing very fast or
someone having low testosterone or they can't taste or smell or they have poor wound healing
or a poor immune system or even they may develop an ulcer but one huge symptom for a lack of zinc
is poor sleep so zinc has a major influence over the central nervous system in fact it's the second
most abundant trace mineral in your brain it's involved in neurotransmitters which are those
hormone communications that travel through the nervous system it's also essential for making
adenosine now what is adenosine adenosine is that molecule that gradually builds up through the day
and creates sleep pressure it's that compound that controls pressure that pushes you into the
deep sleep and all night long when you're sleeping adenosine breaks down and then you become awake
right also caffeine blocks adenosine and that's why caffeine makes you more awake but zinc will
help you build up more adenosine which is sleep pressure zinc is also involved in making dopamine
it's also involved in making serotonin which then turns into melatonin the sleep hormone
also zinc is involved in certain biochemical pathways involving glutamate which has a
profound effect on deep sleep so zinc is what is called a sleep modulator it helps control
sleep now anytime you take zinc i also recommend you take it with copper in a certain ratio so for
every eight to ten milligrams of zinc you want to take point five to one milligrams of copper
and 0.5 milligrams of copper is 500 micrograms so roughly you'd want 10 times more zinc than you do
copper and i also recommend taking that zinc copper and a blend of trace minerals now out
of all the food that you can eat oysters have the highest amount of zinc and also oysters are loaded
with taurine which is not only good for increasing your physical performance but it's also good for
your sleep cycles and oysters also have something called gaba receptor agonist
now what is that that is something that activates gaba okay and gaba is all about
calming the nervous system down helping you sleep and it's been found that people with shorter
amount of sleep have significantly less zinc than those people who can sleep longer and lastly
the blood-brain barrier has low permeability for zinc so if you're very deficient in zinc you're
just not going to sleep so it really helps to beef up no pun intended your zinc supply all right so
there's many things you can do for sleep and zinc is definitely one thing to add to the list

so why do you need to do the ketogenic diet and fasting at the same time and what is the actual
difference between the ketones generated when you're on the diet versus when you're
doing fasting we're going to discuss that and so the common thread between doing the diet
and doing fasting is that you have a lowered glucose okay and you also have a lowered insulin
that's a hormone and so when you do this you have all sorts of amazing benefits you lose
weight your blood sugars now are regulated you have better mood you have improved cognitive
function focus memory concentration you have less inflammation and you have decreased cravings
but there's some very unique additional benefits that occur with fasting okay when
you do fasting you create an epigenetic effect okay what does epigenetics mean it means above
genes so if you were born with bad genes or you had some you know gene that triggered this or that
those genes could be controlled epi genetically in other words fasting creates an effect
on your genes that turn off the bad genes and turn on the good genes okay so that's one thing that's
very very important and some of this information i got from sim land who i'll put his link down below
or his website you can check it out he wrote a great book he was in my last summit and
he's really really knowledgeable about intermittent fasting number two autophagy
you don't experience autophagy when you're just doing keto okay what is autophagy autophagy is
like getting the junk out of the trunk all the dead cells all the damaged proteins in your body
get recycled and turn into brand new cells so this is why you look younger when you start
doing intermittent fasting because you induce autophagy which does a lot more than anti-aging
but it's just a cleaning process you're recycling um garbage through the body and that way that
garbage doesn't sit there and create inflammation and a lot of a lot of bad things number three
it will turn on genes that specifically allow dna to repair better it's quite interesting
when you inside the cell you have these blueprints they're called dna and your body actually makes a
copy of them okay then it's called rna and it's transported outside the cell into these little
machines or factories that start building body tissue now it's very very bad if there's some
errors in this genetic code in the blueprints because then they're going to start reproducing
the wrong body tissue and so when you do fasting it improves the repair process
in scanning the code and looking for errors and coming in there and fixing them before
they're used in the factories and this is fascinating that your body would actually do that
also fasting will turn on genes to adapt to stress better you become more protected against stress
even if someone is on some type of chemotherapy or radiation when you do fasting your cells
become more resistant that's interesting all right number four you start increasing your antioxidant
networks your body actually makes antioxidants so you can get them from food or your body makes them
when you do fasting your body builds up that network so now you have more antioxidants to
protect yourself against oxidation and pollution etc etc number five you get decreased inflammation
and this comes in handy especially if you have arthritis some autoimmune disease or you have
some pain in your body that tends to be chilled out number six you can decrease your risk of
cancer okay certain genes that trigger cancer are turned off in addition to that
there's something else in your body that controls growth there's actually quite a
few but there's two things specifically one is called mtor which is a thing in your body that
can be good or bad it can actually increase the growth of cancer if it's too high fasting
turns that thing right off when you're on the ketogenic diet you're eating
it doesn't turn this off because eating increases this so fasting especially if you're doing
periodic prolonged fasting can turn this off which can greatly reduce the size of tumors
and actually prevent and shrink cancer which is very very cool also you'll get a decrease in
something called igf which you normally always see when you have cancer as well because it's a growth
hormone and so when you fast you get a decrease in this and that so anyone that gets cancer
should be doing fasting in a major way it's probably the most important thing
number seven you get an increase in growth hormone and that's the anti-aging that's fat burning
and growth hormone helps prevent the loss of muscle because your body's going to protect that
when you're eating regardless of what you're eating you're not stimulating growth hormone
near as much as when you're doing fasting of course when you add exercise that will increase
it as well all right number eight this one's a really important one you can you can increase your
stem cells in your immune system what is this going to do it's going to protect you against
invading pathogens viruses bacteria so as far as your immune system goes fasting is
vital vital vital so you'll get sick less often and when you do get an infection you recover
faster so apparently and it's kind of ironic that this would happen but as you starve off
the microbes they become stronger and become more diversified and number 10 there's something called
migration motor complex it's basically when the muscles in your colon start creating a little bit
of a wave and push all the food particles through the rest of your digestion so you can kind of
clear out stuff that has been sitting there for a while i mean think about the average person who
eats not just three times a day but they have the snacks in between the meals they eat late at night
they are literally cramming food down this pipe and it's constantly filled up 24 7. they never
actually have a chance to clean it out so this is a cleaning out process when you do intermittent
fasting that's very very therapeutic for the lining of your colon to prevent um bacteria from
being in the wrong place etc etc now there's many other things that intermittent fasting will do but
one big one is that it will completely get rid of your hunger your appetite goes away
even more than when you're on the ketogenic diet simply because even though a low-carb diet reduces
insulin the fact that you're eating can stimulate some insulin so this is why the combination
of keto and IF i think is essential because if you're doing intermittent fasting without keto
the higher amount of carbs that you would eat is going to prevent
some of the cool effects that you experience but if you're doing keto without intermittent fasting
you won't get these effects right here you'll get these effects but you won't get the whole package
so let me let's just weigh this out let's see you get younger you get thinner you get happier
smarter because your brain neurons start to grow
and less disease hmm hard choice but i think uh i'll go with the keto and iaf
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put
a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

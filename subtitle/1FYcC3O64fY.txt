let's talk about the most important function of vitamin E and that is
it stabilizes cell membranes now what's interesting about the cell membrane is
that it has a double layer of fat both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids so
people are always concerned about oh my gosh saturated fat you need to avoid it
well the cell membrane is made out of saturated fat and cholesterol and you
have all sorts of things happening at the cellular membrane you have the
protection of the inside of the cell you have all these many little organs
they're called organelles you have a little energy factory in there called
the mitochondria you have the lysosome which is the garbage disposal you have
the DNA in the nucleus you have the protein factories you have little
factories that make things out of lipids so there's a lot going on and the cell
membrane is there to protect it and then you have billions of little pumps one
would be the sodium potassium pump and this pump generates a lot of energy to
activate the muscles and the nerves and its primary job is to keep sodium out of
the cell and potassium in to create this battery and that electrical charge is
inside the cell and that can actually be used by the muscles and the nerves allow
them to function so vitamin E helps prevent the oxidation of this fat layer
right here as well as the fat structures inside the cell it's a significant
antioxidant and it does work with selenium as well it prevents retinopathy
which is a disease of your retina which is the nerve and so the eye it's
basically an extension of the brain sticking out in the eye and the reason
why vitamin E prevents this condition is because vitamin E is all about
protecting fat soluble structures and anything related to nerve has a fat
layer it's called myelin sheath because vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin it
also supports glutathione which is a the most powerful antioxidant in your body
and it mainly works in your liver it also prevents nerve damage why
because of the myelin sheath which is all fat now most of the vitamin E is
stored in the liver and the fat cell but with significant amounts inside your
pituitary so think about it all the sex hormones estrogen progesterone
testosterone even cortisol originate as a controlling hormone in your pituitary
so because these hormones are made out of cholesterol and fat you need high
levels of vitamin E to protect them from being oxidized and by the way one of the
functions of estrogen is to act as an antioxidant so during menopause when
estrogen goes down with other hormones like progesterone and even testosterone
and if you don't have enough vitamin E to compensate hot flashes can kick in
there and this is why vitamin E as a remedy will help to reduce hot flashes
but make sure if you anytime you take vitamin E always take it in the natural
form and get something that includes all the tocopherols with the tocotrienols
as one big complex vitamin E also has been shown to decrease fibrosis of the
liver why because it's an antioxidant and fibrosis occurs from all the free
radical damage and inflammation in the liver and without vitamin E it can
continue so it can help mitigate cirrhosis another thing that happens
when you take vitamin E is your muscles seem to get stronger so if you're
deficient in vitamin E your muscles will be weaker typically people are not
deficient in vitamin E because of the diet it's mainly because of the
absorption either they had some alteration in the digestive system
whether they had gastric bypass or they had some surgery or they have scar
tissue in the gut creating a lack of absorption or they don't have a
gallbladder or they have sludge in the gallbladder so they don't have enough
bile to help them absorb it I mean they could be deficient in the diet but
typically it's other causes but anyway I wanted to emphasize the importance of
vitamin E for your cell membranes and if you want more information about vitamin
E as far as where to get it from the foods check out this video

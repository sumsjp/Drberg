so today I'm going to talk about how to fix your voice if you if you're a singer
if you use your voice a lot and you have a little bit of a raspiness or
hoarseness or a little bit of laryngitis i'm gonna show you how to improve it
within two minutes or less it's a great technique now I did a video on this
while ago but it's really really hard to find that video so I decided to create
another one if you haven't seen this technique yet but it is so powerful and
so simple but it's not backed up by any type of scientific study so you're not
going to find anything on this just something that I came up with in my
clinic being in practice for 29 years and I just want to say that it works a
great majority of the time so there's two ways to do this technique you can
either use a device and position it on your neck okay while you lay down on the
couch or you can get someone else to watch
this video and apply the technique on you okay because there's certain
pressure points you're gonna be using I'm not gonna necessarily get into how
this works but it just does so just try it and you can comment down below but
what you're going to do is you're going to first rate your raspiness
scratchiness or laryngitis or hoarseness as far as severity and wherever the
location is okay so on a scale from 1 to 10 0 being no problem 10 being very
severe so you want to isolate that number because we're gonna rewrite it at
the very end and the second step is just to locate where it is so just try to
sense where it is and just point to where it is okay is it right here here
here just put your finger on it now in the third step you're gonna apply
pressure on the opposite side on the back so you're just going to draw like a
line around your neck on the back part so let's say for example you located it
right here so you're gonna be pressing on the opposite side on the back part so
let me demonstrate that right now alright so the first thing you're going
to do if you're going to get someone else to do it they're gonna have to
press on the back part so we just already isolated
we drew a lines in the back from the front part we found it's going to be
like right here so you're gonna take your hand take your middle finger right
here I'm not flipping you off and your thumb
and you're gonna press this way on both sides so I'm going to take stabilize the
forehead and press inward on the back part now what we're trying to do is
we're trying to apply pressure on the exact opposite side where the person has
that raspiness some type of symptom whether it's laryngitis or a tickle or
whatever okay you're going to apply this pressure equal on both sides of their
neck now what you're gonna feel when you press in here gently is you're gonna
feel you're looking for a tender spot and a tight spot so you might want to
feel around a little bit above and below and then you're gonna find it it's gonna
be a real tender in a tight spot like the neck is like restricted and when you
find that you just hold that for one to two minutes and then I like to ask the
person and tell me when your your vocal cords or your voice sounds a little bit
better just maybe I have a count or something and then they start saying oh
it's starting to clear up now if it doesn't feel sore to them then
you raise your fingers up just a millimeter higher or lower and you ask
them is this it right here is this is right here because the way that you know
you found the exact correct spots on both sides is where you find like the
epicenter of where it hurts okay so you'd want to apply the pressure so
you're not hurting them but just some gentle pressure holding that in there
okay so you're just increasing the circulation to this whole part of their
their neck and you're just gonna find that it will work alright so after you
hold this for about two minutes you're gonna ask them to rewrite this symptom
okay and they're gonna tell you what the number is and they also may say oh now
it moved up a little bit higher or down a little bit lower so then you just redo
it higher or lower until all that discomfort is gone let's say for example
it moved to slightly the left side then more pressure on the left side than the
right side so this works with the principle of opposites wherever you have
pain or discomfort you can press on the opposite side and it tends to relieve
the area now if you don't have a friend or a family member that can do this you
can use this tool right here this is a massage tool that I created for myself
to work on myself and it's in three different sizes it's it's it's very thin
medium and wide for larger people so for him we're gonna use the medium size and
you can let lay back on a tall back chair or a couch and it's like using my
fingers but the device so you're letting the device work with gravity to
automatically press in there and it's very very large so it's not very painful
at all and you can lay back on the couch and put those points right there and
adjust it until you hit the exact spot and give it some time and to pour it to
work and as far as the frequency of doing this you can do it to two or three
times a day you can even do it more if it's too sore ease off and then just do
this every single day until it's completely gone now
the only time this doesn't work is let's say for example you have a serious
infection or a viral infection and it might have to run its course
and but even then you should see some improvement in the vocal cords I've done
this on hundreds of people professional opera singers and it works so go ahead
and try it and put your comments down below

hey dr. Berg here in this short video I'm going to talk about what is really
behind the stubborn weight issue if you're struggling with losing weight you
need to know this if you look around most people fall into
one of four body types now sometimes they'll hold it in the
hips what that is it's an estrogen problem it's too much
estrogen some people hold their weight in the stomach as the protruding belly
that is a liver problem some people have a sagging belly that is an adrenal
problem but it's too much cortisol that's that stress hormone and then some
people hold the weight all over and not in any one location that is a thyroid
problem but it's usually secondary to higher estrogen or a liver so that's why
I didn't put it on there because that's usually secondary now what you have to
realize is this weight is a symptom of something else so why can't you lose
weight because you're treating the weight directly there's always an
underlying cause let me show you okay so now weight
especially stubborn weight is a symptom of something so the question is why well
your metabolism is slow right you maybe you thought your metabolism is slow and
it probably is but then what causes this because what we don't want to do is we
do not want to treat the slow metabolism directly with some pill or some berry or
stimulant because there's an underlying reason why it's slow and it has to do
with hormones okay so we don't want to treat the weight directly because that's
gonna just treat the symptom it's not going to work you probably already tried
that we don't want to treat the metabolism we want to strengthen the
hormones but now let me explain what I mean by that so let me erase this and
I'll show you what I mean okay so now there are six there are six
fat burning hormones that are triggered by various things that you're going to
actually do eating exercise and things like that and this has been a huge focus
probably on a lot of people they're focusing in
to stimulate fat-burning but what they don't know is this there are three
hormones that are dominating they're fat making hormones so these are the burning
hormones of fat burning and these are the fat making hormones so there's
hormones that make fat this one is called insulin now this is what
explained all the low carb diets low glycemic this is low sugar diets right
you probably know sugars bad for you and you might have cravings if you have
cravings all that means is that you're burning sugar you're not burning fat so
insulin is one of them in the presence of a little bit of insulin these will be
blocked cancelled out it takes just a little bit of bad thing to destroy a lot
of good stuff okay so we have insulin and the next one is called cortisol
cortisol is a fat making hormone so in the presence of too much cortisol and
that would be stress these again are nullified cancelled out and lastly
estrogen so in the presence of too much estrogen these are canceled out so what
I want to do is expand your concept of not just focusing on what to do but
eliminating these three counter hormones and there's various ways that we can do
that using eating plans certain techniques and even nutritional
techniques okay so that would be an interesting concept because if this is
too high you're going to gain weight in the hip and this is too high you'll gain
weight in the belly I don't care how many sit-ups you do I don't care how
many hours of exercise you do it's not going to work

now if you have the bullseyes rash somewhere on your body does that absolutely mean that you have
lyme disease that is a question for this short video probably in the last year i had over 15
different ticks end up in my body with different rashes so i did a little research on this and i
want to share some data with you now the first thing you need to know is that ticks carry this
bacteria that can drill into your body it's called the spirochite because it's kind of like this
corkscrew and this could lead to lyme's disease so the classic rash of lyme's disease is the bullseye
rash however just because you have the bullseye's rash doesn't mean you're going to get lyme or you
have lyme disease it could be something else like southern tick associated rash illness
which is a related type illness and you may have mild flu symptoms fatigue muscle pain a headache
and this usually occurs in the south central states in the u.s so if you have the southern
tick associated rash illness it can look like a bullseye or it can just look like a regular rash
there's also another tick that can give you a rash that doesn't even look like the bullseye
it's just a regular rash and that comes from something called a lone star tick another name
for it would be the northern water tick or the turkey tick or the cricker tick
so just because you get a rash or a bowl-sized rash doesn't mean you're going to end up with
lime one more point about ticks they're little vampires because they live on blood and if they're
younger they usually are in the lower grass as they get older they can climb up different plants
and even in trees and they can even hang out with their legs dangling out waiting for you to walk by
so they can attach on you and you usually won't even know it because they have certain chemicals
that numb the skin so you don't even know if they're crawling on you or if they bite you
but they can attach to dogs and the dogs can bring them in and actually end up on you and i think
really that's what happened to me charlie our dog is always out in the grass and so he'll pick them
up and bring them right in and then i'll get the tick now i have a few more videos on lyme's
disease and ticks i put a link down below to check out more information so if you happen to get lungs

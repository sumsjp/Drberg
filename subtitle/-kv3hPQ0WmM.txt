let's talk about zinc's influence over cortisol
zinc is a trace mineral i've done a lot of videos on it but it has a huge
influence over something called the hpa axis hypothalamus which is in the brain
pituitary and then we have adrenal so we have this whole
feedback loop going on so the adrenals are controlled by the hypothalamus
through the pituitary's help and zinc supports this whole pathway
so when you take zinc you actually have the ability to lower cortisol
zinc also increases gaba which is very calming
so when you take zinc it calms you down here's another problem with lowered zinc
when you're low in zinc you're automatically going to be a
little bit higher in copper because they work together
when you have this ratio right here it's not good because then you start getting
copper toxicity or copper overload and you get anxiety
depression higher levels of cortisol and it puts your body in a stress
mode so you're in flight or fight the other point i want to make is if you
have a hidden infection in your body some people
have chronic fatigue syndrome or they have fibromyalgia
or they have some type of low-grade infection
behind the scenes they're under stress they have this infection
they have inflammation in the joints other places in the throat
that is going to deplete a lot of your zinc
and it's going to raise your cortisol so that has to be addressed so
if this situation is going on you need to do some additional things
like aloe leaf extract colloidal silver oregano oil to handle the deeper source
of the infection so your body doesn't have to utilize all this zinc
you can get zinc from shellfish pumpkin seeds
brazil nuts so the point of this video is if you have some
underlying stress situation or you can't sleep
and you're trying to do everything you can you may want to also include
zinc thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product

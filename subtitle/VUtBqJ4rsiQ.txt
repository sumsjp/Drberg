hi guys dr. Berg here in this short video I'm going to show you how to instantly reduce neck
stiffness okay it's a pretty cool technique so here's what you do just follow along with me
I want you to tuck your head forward for me okay now bring your head back as far as you can now I
want you to do it again but this time just notice which direction you can't go into or produces pain
okay so just do it again and notice where is the restriction is it going forward or going
back okay for me it's going back so I can't quite bring my head back as far as going forward okay so
that's the notice restriction now we're going to do if you can't move your head back you're going
to stretch in the opposite direction about five times so I'm going to take my hand and go forward
watch this I'm just stretching going forward five times okay once you do that go ahead and reassess
and you'll notice that your head is like fully moving back now now what's interesting is we
use the principle of opposites if you stretch in the direction that it's opposing the restriction
you can fix tightness okay so now if you had a hard time going forward you're going to stretch
backwards just take your chin pull back all the way about five times and we're just stretching
we're sending neurological inputs into the muscles and then you'll reassess maybe like
wow it's full range of motion you can do it with looking to the left the right lateral is flexing
you can do with any muscle or joint okay so go ahead and apply this and put your comments below

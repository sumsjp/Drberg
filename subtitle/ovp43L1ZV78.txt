hey guys I have a question do you actually eat healthy and feel sick if
that's your situation I won't explain what what's behind that 99% of the time
it's related to your digestion okay there's some type of low-grade
inflammatory response going on in the digestive tract usually from food
allergies okay now what's happening is food allergies are creating this
constant inflammation with the intestinal wall and that creates
histamines and histamines make you feel funky tired flu-like symptoms joints
achy okay so so the real problem is is this it's like what's behind allergies
what causes allergies well there's some information that you need to know about
allergies okay number one the anti allergic
anti allergic substances or medications to give you are usually related to
prednisone or cortisone things like that and what is that that's adrenal hormones
okay so really allergies are some failure in the adrenal system now the
other thing that we know about allergies is that allergies mainly exist in more
of an alkaline body not an acidic body but an overly alkaline body and it's
just coincidence that an adrenal body type they're more alkaline as well so
alkalosis is a real big problem so so there's a couple things you need to do
alright if you think about the cause of allergies you could just like the
stomach is normally between one and three a very very acidic and the goal of
the stomach is to break down the proteins into very small particles so
you can digest them if you have undigested protein from your stomach
going through your intestine you can develop allergies just from that okay so
we need this set up on the stomach so the stomach is very acid and the large
bowel has friendly bacteria lactobacillus that makes lactic acid
okay so you have bacteria that make a so if you lose those bacteria you don't
have that acidifying effect in your colon so a couple things you need to do
is number one over time acidify your your digestive tract the problem you're
going to run into is if you're too alkaline
you probably have a lot of inflammation in there right now so you have tissue
that's probably swollen inflamed irritated so dumping a lot of acid might
make you worse so you're going to have to slowly do it over time and maybe put
a lot of chlorophyll in your body wheatgrass juice powder would work or
leafy greens or some type of healing agent chlorophyll tablets you can do
that and that will start to heal your body and then slowly start dumping more
acid in and you can use apple cider vinegar betaine hydrochloride that would
really help okay so we want to acidify the body slowly over time and then add
more and more number two probiotics so you want to get a probiotic that's a
high quality probiotic I like the liquid once and you can start taking this over
a period of time start off very very small and gradually increase because
chances are you don't have the full complement of microbes to help you and
if you dump too much in there you're going to create like a storm of a
reaction so you want to start very small and gradually put that in there so over
time you have all the flora that's making your acid for you and the allergies
start going away okay the third thing is to avoid the things that
trigger the allergy so I like to keep a notebook and then make a note of every
time you eat what do you react to is it you know a certain food that you're
sensitive to or have an allergy to then I've started avoiding those foods right
now and then avoid it for a period of about four weeks and then you can
reintroduce it but you want to start to avoid the things that are bloating or
making you feel sick and there's always going to be things that that either you
feel a direct immediate reaction sometimes it's a little delayed but from
my experience is pretty immediate but you have to keep a log and the problem
is if you have too many foods at one time you're not going to identify what
allergy that is but I do have some videos on just allergies directly but
these are three things that I would start doing
right now and that's why eating healthy doesn't make you necessarily always make
you healthy if you have a system that can't break down those foods but the key
is that you have to acidify the body and normalize that pH all right thanks for
watching I will see you in the next video

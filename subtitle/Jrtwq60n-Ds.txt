i wanted to mention the real cool benefit of rebound exercise nasa has done quite a bit
of research on rebounding and i'm going to put some links down below but it's actually
quite fascinating that they're doing research on rebounding because what they found is when
you're in space without gravity you start losing your bone tissue and your muscle tissue so they're
trying to come up with ways to counter that but rebounding exercise is jumping on a trampoline
now if you're going to do rebounding and you're a little bit older i would always recommend
doing it with some type of support structure so you can hold yourself because you don't want to
be jumping on this trampoline and jumping off and you know falling or injuring yourself but there's
quite a few benefits to rebounding exercise it's convenient it improves your mobility your posture
your balance your gait it improves the fear of falling it can even reduce your risk of
osteoporosis but i think the biggest benefit has to do with this right here stimulating the
lymphatic system so let me make this very very simple what is the lymphatic system
you have the blood vessels throughout the body the vascular system right
and they go from large vessels to smaller vessels to eventually to tiny little blood vessels called
capillaries in the tissue now in that same tissue next to the capillaries you have the
beginning of the lymphatic system some of the plasma in the blood leaks out into the tissues
and it goes right into the lymphatic system so the fluid in the lymphatic system called lymph
is made up of plasma and several other things which i don't want to get into at this point
and then the lymph system travels through the body and then eventually dumps back
into the vascular system the venous part of the vascular system so it's this whole
continual loop so one function of your lymphatic system is to act as a backup for your vascular
system so if there's too much blood for example the lymph system can handle that overflow
but the thing you need to know about your lymphatic system is it doesn't have a pump
like the vascular system does so it needs movement or else there's no pump the lymph becomes stagnant
or congested the two big purposes of the lymphatic system are number one to support the immune system
because you have all these lymph nodes and you have all these t cells and b cells that help to
capture and consolidate pathogens that have invaded the system and deal with them kill them
and just disregard them as well as to help recycle old red blood cells and damage red blood cells and
recycle them that's what the spleen does the spleen is a very large lymphatic node and the
other function of the lymphatic system that a lot of people are unaware of is that it helps
to transport fat to the body so when you eat dietary fat and it goes into your intestines
it goes directly into the lymphatic system not into your blood vessels fat in water do not
mix so the body has to package this fat in a way that can be transported easily through the system
so one way that it packages the fat is through something called a kylo micron the word kylo means
juice and microns mean small particles so a kylomicron is very simply
the grocery bag that carries the fat to the various parts of the body for both energy and
as a precursor or material to build hormones especially adrenal hormones to counter stress
all of the hormones in the gonads the testosterone estrogen progesterone are made from
fat and cholesterol the cellular membranes need fat the nervous system the brain
needs fat bile comes from cholesterol vitamin d comes from cholesterol so in other words this fat
is very very important to supporting body tissue as well as giving you energy and one very common
thing that i hear over and over and over when people start doing rebounding exercise is their
energy goes straight up and vertical i think it has a lot to do with the fat being more activated
in the lymphatic system so the biggest benefit of rebounding exercise has to do with supporting the
immune system and to help the transportation of fat through the chylomicrons now as a little side
note since we're on the topic of chylomicrons i want to just help you understand this a little
bit better when you get a cholesterol test you usually get your total cholesterol you get ldl
hdl right now let's take a look at this a little bit deeper when someone talks about ldl or hdl
they're not talking about cholesterol they're talking about the carrier bag okay the the
grocery bag that's carrying the fat through the body and so we have different densities of these
bags different sizes and different densities so when we're going from a kylo micron that's the
largest bag it's also called the ultra low density lipoprotein and they're calling it ultra low
because it's basically filled with fat and very little protein and if we look at the relationship
between this all the way down to hdl you can see this is a lot smaller this is the most dense
this is the least dense okay so this has the least amount of fat the most protein this has
the most amount of fat and the least amount of protein so when we go this direction more dense
more protein less lipids why because these are carrier bags that are going to be dumping off
fat into various parts of your body so we go from a cola micron which is an ultra low
dense lipoprotein to a vldl that means very low density lipoprotein and then there's a
little extra step right here called intermediate density lipoprotein and eventually we get to the
low density lipoprotein and most people think this is the bad one but there's actually two types of
ldl there's one that's more pathogenic and one that is non-pathogenic if you're interested
i put some links down below about that and then we get the hdl which is a carrier bag
that takes the cholesterol from the body tissue and brings it back into the liver these other
ones are going to the liver anyway sorry i got sidetracked there for a minute the main thing
you need to know about rebounding is it's really good for your lymphatic system especially if you
have lymphedema all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

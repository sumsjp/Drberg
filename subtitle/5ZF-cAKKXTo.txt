you ever feel so tired but you just can't get to sleep in this video i'm going to give you
a couple things to do number one the obvious one is don't drink any water past 7 o'clock
drinking a lot of water right before you go to bed you're just going to get up to the night and
urinate all that means is you have insulin resistance or it could be your pre-diabetic
because what happens is that water tends to follow sugar in the body and if your
blood sugars are a little too high and you're filtering that through your kidneys
you're going to release excess water through the night so a simple solution would be to get on keto
and get off the carbs and stop snacking i remember in practice i worked with a guy who was getting up
10 times a night urinating completely unnecessary he got off his carbs went on keto did intermittent
fasting and within a couple weeks he's able to sleep through the entire night without getting up
one single time all right the next thing i want to bring up is stimulants specifically coffee could
be tea could be chocolate if you're doing too much that could be the reason why you're not sleeping
so i would highly suggest that you only do like one cup of coffee in the morning about eight
ounces not a big cup just a small cup that's what i do it seems to work if i drink too much coffee
i tend to not sleep as well all right next point is your protein consumption if you do too much
protein that could keep you up because protein is a stimulant it can give you too much energy
especially if you're snacking on protein in between the meals so just keep your protein
to a moderate amount anywhere between three to eight ounces per meal all right next point i
want to bring up is you may have too much body energy especially if in the past you were an
athlete let's say you did a lot of sports uh high school college and then now you don't
your mitochondria the energy factories in your cells um have developed to a certain capacity that
they can generate a lot of energy but unless you use that energy it could sit around and just keep
you from sleeping so if you have too much body energy you're gonna have to use that energy either
by doing some long walks workouts or the best ways through physical work if you could do some
physical work around the yard or whatever every day that's definitely going to deplete the energy
and you'll sleep better all right next point is to practice relaxation there's a great video that
i did on this i'll put a link down below but it's just consciously relaxing through the day so many
people are just one big ball of stress especially in their jaws which tighten up the upper back
it affects their breathing and they try to go to sleep it's not going to work
next point is to catch the first wave the circadian wave of the sleep cycles at night when
it starts to get dark you have various hormone waves as well as neurotransmitter waves that occur
that's stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light so you may find that you start to get really
tired around i don't know 8 30 9 o'clock it could be 9 30 and then because you're not ready for bed
you push through that now that wave comes up now you have to sometimes wait 90 minutes before you
catch the next wave so what you want to do is if you're tired at i don't know 9 o'clock 9
30 go to bed i go to bed at 9 30 every single night it seems to work great i get the best sleep
and if i push through it let's say i'm watching a movie or something then i'm awake now it takes me
a while to get back to sleep so pay attention to your body and ride the first wave all right
next point is to take a sleep aid before you go to bed i'm not talking about medication i'm talking
about some type of natural sleep aid there's many out there of course i'm not biased i'm
going to recommend mine i put a link down below if you want more information on that but taking
certain natural remedies before you go to bed can can greatly help you and there is one remedy
that i want to mention let's say for example your body is exhausted but your head is awake
one remedy that i found works good for that is calcium lactate you would just take two of those
before bed it can help last point is to keep the room on the colder side because if it's too hot
that's going to keep you up our bodies tend to sleep better in a slightly cooler environment go
ahead and apply these and comment down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

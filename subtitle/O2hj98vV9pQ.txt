so I'm gonna show you a quick way to determine if you have brain damage or
not now this is what I don't want you to do I don't want you to go up to your
friends or your family members and tell them hey I just saw a video of Dr. Berg's
and I think you have brain damage okay don't do that this is for you and not
for them what you have to realize is pretty much everyone acquires some
degree of damage in their brain as they age and that has to do with a lack of
fuel in your neurons in one study it was shown that an average person loses about
30 percent of their brain cells as they get older into their 80s and even 90s
and so that's what I'm talking about what I'm talking about brain damage so
it's not just dementia it could happen very gradually like you're looking
for words and you're trying to remember where you put your keys that type of
thing that is simply a situation where your neurons are starving of fuel and
the symptoms would be loss of memory loss of clarity loss of focus and
attention and that comes from doing a high carbohydrate diet because over time
your body is going to resist the carbohydrates it's going to create
insulin resistance and now the glucose can't go into the brain cells and they
starve the good thing about this is that neurons actually prefer a different type
of fuel not glucose but ketones in fact if given the choice between glucose and
ketones the brain will always choose ketones as their preferred fuel so if
your neurons are starving for a glucose just feed them ketones so now here is
the experiment I would like you to do simply get on the ketogenic diet and
intermittent fasting I put a link down below and within one to two weeks notice
your cognitive improvements are you sharper are you more focused is
memory better and what about you mood has it gone up if so then we know
there's some level of damage in your brain or you can try another experiment
you can take MCT oil when you take this oil medium chain triglycerides comes
from coconuts what's gonna happen is you're gonna make ketones directly
without even going on a ketogenic diet and your brain will absorb those ketones
and if there is damage within the brain your cognitive function will start to
improve you'll be sharper better focus more attention better memory and even a
better mood so if there's improvement in either one of these then we know there's
been some damage going on MCT oil basically gives you instant fuel that
bypasses the damage that the carbohydrate diet created now one thing
that a lot of people realize when they start a ketogenic diet and when they
start intermittent fasting is they start feeling better okay with more
energy and their cognitive function starts to really improve and definitely
their mood increases so obviously they stay on the diet for a long period of
time now the cool thing about being on this program is it can even overtime
improve the damage of your brain rather than getting a cat scan or MRI of your
brain just simply change the fuel source and then evaluate it decide if it's
something that you want to do long term alright thanks for watching and I put
the link down below of how to do the keto diet as well as intermittent fasting
the correct way thanks for watching with another amazing recipe no brains no
sugar totally keto
there's no suffering in Keto absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the
recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy making it as much as we

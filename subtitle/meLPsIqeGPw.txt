so blood pressure what is blood pressure well first of all it's the if you're
measuring two things you're measuring the heart's ability to contract and the
heart's ability to relax so the contraction pressure it's called the
systolic should be 120 amount of pressure and 80 is the diastolic that's
the bottom number and that's the ability of the heart to relax so if this is high
then the person the heart is like it's like a muscle that's contracting but
it's not letting down and turning off enough this is too high we get too much
contraction this is controlled by the sympathetic part of the nervous system
and this is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system okay so
that's what this is and when you have an adrenal problem you'll start to get a
problem with the systolic going too high at before the diastolic so make note of
that because that's one another thing that you should know about when you do
your evaluation now pulse rate the pulse rate is the number of times the heart
will beat in a course of a minute normal it should be 72 the more fit the person
is it should go down to 60 50 maybe even 40 okay but if the person is not
exercising and they're kind of overweight or whatever and it's low that
means it's a weak heart if it's high too high they're losing the parasympathetic
control and they're not able to push it down and so that's that on that HRV
graph that's the small dial that going going to the left it's weaker so if you
look at the HRV graph if the small dial which should be here you're going to see
it go right here as they lose that parasympathetic the pulse rate will go
higher higher higher because it can't push the thing down now the other
problem that can cause a high pulse rate would be potassium deficiency and why
would they get a potassium deficiency not just because they're not eating
enough potassium and from the food because they have to
have seven cups but they're eating a lot of sugar sugar depletes potassium
refined carbohydrates will deplete potassium cheesecake might deplete some
potassium if there's sugar in it and then the pulse rate goes higher and higher
higher and the person is going to hear a little beat boom boom boom boom in their
ear so then you add more greens and then avocado whatever and then we have to
avoid the sugar so that's what I want to talk about with blood pressure

so i keep eating this question over and over and over i just wanted to create a video to
explain it okay and the question is this why can't i go longer than three hours before i am
starving i'm hungry and i need to eat some food so this is a problem of fasting you just can't
fast very long and what this means is you have a serious blood sugar problem an average thin
person is carrying around about a hundred thousand calories of fat on their bodies
yet we only have a very small amount of stored sugar it's called glycogen it's in the liver it's
in the muscles so we have about only 1700 calories of stored sugar and a tremendous amount of stored
fat so the problem is we're not able to tap into this fat because we have a blood sugar problem
we have what's called insulin resistance what is that well that is a situation where your pancreas
is pumping out a lot of insulin and the receptor won't receive it because it's too much and so then
we don't get the communication back here because this is blocked so then the pancreas just produces
more and more and more and more insulin so we have high levels of insulin when we have insulin
resistance and it's the high level of insulin that prevents someone from tapping into the fat
what allows you to tap into the fat and make this transition is low levels of insulin
and so the question is how do you get someone to fast for a longer period of time so they're
not so hungry and craving all the time very very simple once you understand this
you must rid 100 percent of the sugars and the hidden sugars fruit includes dates mango
especially apples you can have some berries but not any of the sweeter fruits yogurt which has a
good amount of sugar in it especially if it's sweetened but even the plain has sugar in it
juice yes that has that's like equivalent to soda honey is very similar to regular sugar it will
prevent you from tapping in the fat so doing the keto program partially doesn't work you have to
bring the sugars way down in order for you to really get over here and start running off of
your fat and then what happens you can go longer because you won't be hungry and you won't crave
anymore and you definitely want to make sure and this is very important that you don't snack
sometimes people even on keto have this idea i can just have a little snack in between the meal like
even if it's a healthy snack let's say it's some nuts or something like that what's gonna happen
that little bit of snack is going to make you hungry about an hour to two to three hours later
you're going to be hungry because eating makes you hungry why because it stimulates insulin
even if you consume protein it'll stimulate some degree of insulin and then insulin will push the
blood sugars down and you end up with a blood sugar problem so no more snacking number three
just add more fat at the end of the meal if we take a look at a meal the first thing that i like
to do is have my vegetable first my salad second thing with the protein which usually has fat in it
and then the last thing is maybe some additional fat whether it's olives peanut butter or whatever
because if you actually add more fat to the meal it's going to allow you to fast
longer and fasting longer is going to help you transition over here too so we have a combination
of lowering your carbs and sugar and fasting longer both of those things will help you drop
insulin and everything is going to work really nicely the last thing that i would do is add
more fiber in the form of vegetable salad why because you can't digest that fiber your microbes
take care of it for you they can digest the fiber they turn it into various chemicals
that actually help your blood sugars there's a chemical called butyrate which actually comes from
a microbe consuming the fiber and that butyrate actually helps insulin resistance it's also by the
way anti-cancer so if you're doing keto without a lot of vegetables that could be a problem in
the transition especially if you have a history of blood sugar issues and insulin resistance so
after you do this you're going to fast longer and a lot of things are going to get
better but realize this the longer you've had a blood sugar problem and insulin resistance
the more difficult it's going to take to make the transition and the longer you're going to
have to do this to see really good amazing results before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about juicing and
keto had another question can i juice on a ketogenic diet let's talk about that
well you have two types of things that people juice fruit juice and the
vegetable juice okay I would not recommend consuming fruit juice because
it's just too high in sugar you're taking out the fiber but you're left
with a lot of sugar in there okay a lot of fructose too especially in certain
fruits now vegetables are not going to give you that sweetness so that's going
to be totally fine if you want to juice but the problem is that it's really hard
to consume without adding a little carrot juice and apple in there and I
used to do that all the time I used to do so much carrot juice til my skin turn
it sort of turning orange so I don't recommend it because your blood sugars
will spike and it caused the hypoglycemic reaction on me when I
started having too much juice but the point is that it's real hard to do this
without adding the fruit so if you can not add the fruit then go for it alright
now because the fiber buffers the insulin response so it's much better
they consume the whole vegetable or the whole fruit but I don't recommend fruit
on it keep stirring diet maybe some small amounts of berries maybe half a
cup cup but not necessarily fruit but let's say you're you don't you're not
doing the ketogenic diet and you want to do fruit go for just consume the whole
fruit so now also our blending is better when you put in put your kale and
berries in a shake and you blend it because you have all the fiber the whole
thing in one unit that's much better than juicing now when you drink v8 or
orange juice for example or grape juice you have to realize that all that is
pasteurized the heat the extreme heat kill off the enzymes a lot of these
vitamins are heat sensitive so realize when you're consuming that you're not
consuming what you think you're consuming okay and then the other
question is what about the wheatgrass juice powder because that's the juice
should you do it well the wheatgrass juice powder per serving has one gram
carbohydrate you're allowed 20 to 50 grams okay so one gram of carbohydrate
isn't too bad and if you wanted something with a little sweetness as
stevia lemon and that way you can get the sweetness but without the sugar I do
have a plane - it's not that bad tasting some people need the sweetness but the
point is you can do that comfortably because you're getting a lot of
nutrients without the sugar okay all right thanks for watching hi guys hey

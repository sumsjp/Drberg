hey guys hi what did we make today Karen oh we made candied pecans sugar free oh
my gosh pecans are at my absolutely favorite nut in the world and what could
you put this on well I would put it on a salad because I love candied pecans on
salad and I've never been able to have them because of the candied part but now
you could do that but what else could you put it on I think you're gonna say
ice cream yes ice cream and we made a recipe for that that we'll release soon
right I mean these things with vanilla ice cream
unbelievable these things are incredible just absolutely no sugar on these things
but they're sweet they're really good really good hmm you could just eat the whole
bowl mm-hmm you want to say anything about pecans I mean everybody always wants
to hear all the good nutritional facts well it's actually vitamin B6 mm-hmm for
carpal tunnel syndrome Karen make a mental note okay I feel better already

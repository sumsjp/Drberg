so I just want to give you a little um
history now you um you have a heart
problem you have a calcified aortic Arch
right aorta and the arch okay and then I
think um did they diagnose you with
something a certain thing or
um aortic stenosis okay and then they
wanted to do
um remove
um replace the aortic Arch
and then replace the aortic valve and
the mitral valve and two bypasses okay
and other than that they didn't want to
do anything no that's all no that's all
that's all that's a lot
so then I told her I said we have some
spare parts in the back but she didn't
want to do that now I'm just kidding
um so you you the some of the symptoms
that you had or before you came were
what well
um I could you know I didn't breathe
very well
um I would you know take short breaths
and today I'm breathing much better I
don't feel every breath I take totally
and then you have to get asthma yes and
I have asthma as I was wheezing a couple
days ago and then you also had sleeping
problems yes really would I sleep more
than three hours at a time and then you
also climbing stairs wasn't the best
thing right
um I you know I could barely make it
upstairs
so basically we we worked on the the
adrenal acupressure points and uh
um and just kind of tell me how you
slept
um well the the last night was a last
night I went to sleep around 11 and I
didn't wake up until about six and we
went to the restroom and then I went
right back to sleep and woke up at 8 30.
but um you know I can fall asleep wow
and then you're you're breathing better
yes I'm breathing good oxygen is good
and then you feel more relaxed yes I
feel a lot more relaxed
then I did at first and uh it's been
maybe a couple days or so uh before it's
Friday it's the first day I got a
treatment and it's Monday so that's uh
one two three days and then also you
even you're you're losing weight already
I believe so we didn't but my stomach is
flatter then
before that's a good benefit and then
also you um see when I was watching her
chest breathe when I was working on her
the whole chest was trembling I mean you
can just see it trembling and because
the heart was was working so hard and
everything is so quiet now and you're
not gasping for air which is really good
good so and then um so you feel more
hopeful I feel a lot more helpful
great hope I feel there's hope now
awesome
okay well thank you very much
yeah sure

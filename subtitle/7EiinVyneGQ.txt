all right so what is the most nutrient dense food on the planet not plants organ meats organ meats
have 10 to 100 times more concentrated nutrients than muscle meat you know like if you're going to
get a chicken breast or a steak or a hamburger it has more bioavailable iron zinc selenium
vitamin a vitamin d b12 magnesium b1 b2 alpha lipoic acid b6 phosphorus choline coenzyme q10
well certain types of organ meats like the heart tissue for example and k2 okay
now here's the problem with plants there's no b12 there's no d3 there's no dha which is an omega-3
fatty acid you get the precursor which is ala but you only convert a certain amount the other
problem with plants is that the vitamin a is in the form of a pre-vitamin a and if you're going
to compare vitamin a it's really like 20 times less of course they don't really tell you about
that they just say vitamin a but it's in the form of beta-carotene the other problem with plants is
they have phytates which are anti-nutrients so they block certain minerals like iron
calcium magnesium zinc so even though certain vegetables might have more magnesium for example
the question is are they available to you now the reason why i recommend plants for magnesium
and potassium because it's much easier to get that nutrient because you would have to consume
i don't know 700 grams of animal meats to get the same magnesium for example as you would seven cups
of vegetables so plants definitely are good for certain things and this is of course
why you'd want to combine eating plants with the animal products unless you have very severe
gut issues so now the question is what do plants have that organ meats don't have well
they are loaded with something called phytonutrients and phytonutrients have
some seriously amazing effects for your health anti-inflammatory anti-cancer
anti-diabetic anti-microbial antiviral the list goes on and on and on so phytonutrients give us
a lot of benefit with our health plants have more vitamin k1 and i've already mentioned the
potassium and the magnesium so you would want to combine them but realize that organ meats out of
all the foods have the most concentrated nutrients in the most bioavailable source so personally even
though i know that i don't like to consume organ meats i just don't like the taste so sometimes
i'll get them in supplements or i'll get them hidden in hamburger for example u.s wellness meats
has various products various types of hamburger that they blended in certain organ meats and the
one that i really like which i'll put a link down below and by the way i don't get any kickbacks or
anything like that is the one with hamburger with a little bit of heart meat which is
loaded with coenzyme q10 and i will say when i consume that i do feel i have more endurance

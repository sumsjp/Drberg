so i'm going to talk about the benefits of something called lecithin
you've probably seen it in certain ingredients but i'm going to give you
more awareness on exactly what it is lecithin
is a fat-like substance found in all of your cells
it's also found in plant cells and the greek word for lecithin means
yoke okay now if you take a look at
where you find lecithin well the top thing is
an egg egg yolk one egg would have 3362 milligrams
of lecithin okay 3.5 ounces of beef has 466 milligrams
one half cup of cauliflower has 107 milligrams of lecithin
one ounce of peanuts has 105 milligrams of
lecithin now also organ meats like liver is loaded with lecithin
the problem is when you see lecithin in certain ingredients like it's in
chocolate it's in a lot of baked goods it's in a lot of different products
that usually comes from soy and the majority of soy is
gmo and the way that they extract lecithin from soy is using a solvent
hexane i am not going to recommend that you get your lecithin
from soy products if you did happen to buy an ingredient that said soy lecithin
at the very minimum make sure that it's organic
soy and then that way you know at least it's not going to be
gmo but lecithin is a component part of all of your cell membranes as well as
bile the best source of lecithin would be to consume the eggs or the beef
or the organ meats that's what i would prefer you consuming
more than a supplement but let's talk about the benefits of lecithin
number one it has huge benefits on your brain
okay why because lecithin helps to penetrate the brain and provide
a certain raw material for making neurotransmitters
so it's really good for people that have adhd
memory issues dementia or ticks or tremors
or any type of neurological issue lecithin is really good for the hair the
structure of the hair remember it's involved in all the cell
membranes so if your hair is dried out lecithin
might be a good idea lecithin which also contains choline
is very very powerful in reversing a fatty liver lecithin
triggers the release of bile okay from your
gallbladder and when you have more bile you will have more breakdown or
digestion of fat in your liver because bile helps
regulate bacteria and it ensures that bacteria
doesn't overgrow especially in the wrong place
like your small intestine lecithin because it triggers bile is
really good for sibo okay small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth also lecithin can help you reduce your
hdl it can increase sperm count improve
fertility so it's good for reproduction it's really good for your skin if you
have acne or psoriasis lecithin
is involved in your lungs okay your ability to exchange oxygen
there are certain genetic conditions that you're born without
enough lecithin and you have some major lung problems so
breathing requires lecithin also lecithin is really
important in cardiovascular function and regulating lipids and keeping your
arteries nice and squeaky clean lecithin is an anti-inflammatory
and because lecithin triggers bile it helps reduce
the risk factor of gall stones make sure that you include
foods high in lecithin and this would be at the top of the list

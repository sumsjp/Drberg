let's talk about the first sign of a vitamin f deficiency now you're
probably going what is vitamin f right well in past times there was a vitamin f
but now we don't call it vitamin f because it doesn't really fit the traditional definition of a
true vitamin which is kind of an isolated compound coming from nature but vitamin f really is
the combination of two essential fatty acids and the definition of essential in this context
means that it must come from your diet your body can't make it okay the same thing with essential
amino acids those are amino acids that must be gone from the diet because your body can't make
them versus a non-essential amino acid which your body can make okay so these essential fatty acids
are two one is an omega-3 fatty acid and the other is omega-6 fatty acid the omega-3 is ala
alpha linolenic acid and the omega-6 which is la linoleic acid now these are two essential
fats that you need in every single organ of your body they help you absorb calcium they're both
very important components in cell structure in cell flexibility and in cell growth now the big
problem with these essential fatty acids is in the ratio that we consume them in the western diet
we consume 10 to 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids than we do omega-3 the ideal ratio would be
like two to one or even one to one not twenty to one okay when this ratio becomes
so far out of balance you're going to start developing all sorts of problems with your cells
and the first sign or symptom would be dry and flaky skin so if you have dry flaky skin just
realize you're doing too many omega-6 fatty acids to your omega-3 fatty acids so you want to cut
those down and start consuming more like cod liver oil or fish oil and not the other oils like corn
oil soy oil which are hidden in a lot of different foods i'm going to put a link down below for more
information on that there's other problems as well like prostate enlargement inflammation
problems with your vision problems with the heart problems with your brain like memory problems
so the key is to really get these ratios if you want to get these ratios you can start consuming
certain foods i'm going to list them right here avocados have a really good ratio of these fats
any leafy greens have the right ratios almonds walnuts have the right amounts sprouts of any
seeds have good ratios chia seed sunflower seed olive oil make sure it's the real thing
fish especially fatty fish have the best ratios and eggs so we really get in trouble when we start
doing like fried foods junk foods fast food and start using the salad dressing with all the soy
oil and there's literally thousands of foods at the grocery store with corn oil and canola oil and
and cottonseed oil in many different forms that you need to start avoiding so start to evaluate
your foods from the standpoint of these two essential fatty acids to make sure you're getting
the right ratios ideally they should be one-to-one hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of

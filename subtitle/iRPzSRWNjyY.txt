hello Dr. Berg we're gonna talk about lactose intolerance okay a lot of people have this and
they don't even know they have it and some people think they have it but they don't really have it
so let's talk about that lactose intolerance is a situation where you can't break down lactose that
is milk sugar and there are dairy products that you can buy that says lactose free but here are
the symptoms gas and bloating inflammation pain in the abdomen you know pretty much right after
you eat or it could be delayed several minutes rumbling in the intestine sometimes the lactose
intolerance occurs lower in the small intestine so it takes maybe even an hour to kind of get
down there until you react so it's not always immediate okay but the point is these are the
symptoms so you have to differentiate is a lactose intolerance issue or is it a milk allergy two
separate things an allergy is an allergy to a reaction to the protein in milk which is casein
as nothing to do with the milk sugar so if you consume lactose free products dairy products and
you still have a reaction it could be of a milk allergy the best thing to do is go get tested and
just see if you have a lactose intolerance or is an allergy to milk and especially if you're
reacting to milk and you're eating and you get pain now why do you have a lactose intolerance
problem well it could be several reasons could be a previous damage to your intestinal lining
let's say for example in the past you had a lot of antibiotics let's say in the past you were given
vaccinations that threw off your system let's say you were raised on pasteurized commercial
milk with all the different hormones and chemicals and your body started developing resistance let's
say you have a loss of your immune system for some reason like a huge stress event and you
start getting an autoimmune disorder and that made you your immune system weak so there's a
lot of different things and even as you age you develop a resistance or an intolerance to just
because really you're lacking the enzyme lactase to be able to break down lactose and it can happen
on a gradient scale where you're a little bit lactose intolerance and then it's more and more
severe okay all right so what do you do about it you want to get a good probiotic so you can start
building up your floor your intestinal bacteria so those little guys can start making the enzyme
lactase to digest lactose the one that you want to want to get and when you read the label the type
of microbe would be digital bacterium along them okay so I'll write that down below if you want to
get the exact spelling because those little guys will start making lactase which is the enzyme to
break down lactose now the other thing about what to avoid if you're lactose intolerant is you want
to avoid processed cheese's cheese or milk itself yogurt and cottage cheese because those are the
milk products that have high sugar now anytime you read the label and it says sugar and you can
be pretty much guaranteed that that is the amount of lactose in the product okay so just look at the
sugar so processed cheese for example has 19 grams of sugar that means if 19 grams of lactose that's
a lot of lactose you're going to react pretty bad on that product milk to 12 grams yogurt 10
grams cottage cheese 6 grams of sugar that's all lactose but when you get into cheese like aging
cheeses like cheddar or Swiss is zero well it's like 0.5 to 0.32 sometimes 0 grams of sugar or
zero grams of lactose so just read the label I mean if you really want to be safe just get it
zero but sometimes even a small amount of lactose or milk sugar is not going to be a problem alright

i've done a video on the hypothalamus but i've never done a video on the pituitary so we're
going to talk about what the pituitary is and what does it do it's part of the endocrine system now
it's been called the master gland but to me it's not really the master gland
because the hypothalamus is higher than the pituitary on the echelon of order of
what controls what so i would just call it like the middleman okay so you have the hypothalamus
which if we compare this to a business it's the executive director it holds the function
of the certain plans that are sent down the organization okay so with the hypothalamus it has
pre-programmed plans of action depending on the environment so the pituitary is constantly in
communication with the environment back and forth with all your perception of
getting data and then adapting the various functions of the body to your environment to make
sure you stay at a certain constant so that has to do with what's called homeostasis the ability to
be stable within your environment so if it's cold your body's going to pick up information and adapt
to that coldness if you're being chased by a tiger it's going to adapt to that situation so when i
say pre-programmed plans i'm talking about various reactions that occur for various situations so
the hypothalamus is going to send down the plan to the middle man which is the pituitary and in
a business we would call that the manager right so the manager doesn't necessarily do the work
of the organization but it coordinates and gets other employees or staff to do the work so it's
responsible for coordination giving certain people certain jobs to do and making sure that they do it
and so they're also responsible for compliance and then we have the next echelon in an organization
where you have employees or staff they're doing the work very specific jobs and then when they
comply the job the manager usually manages by statistics to make sure that that job was
done and so the statistics are the feedback that the manager and the executive director get from
the workers especially if it's a very large organization where there's a lot of different
things going on the executive director is not going to go to every single staff member and find
out what they did they're going to work through managers so they can do more work now if we had
a football team we would have the owner of the team we would have the coach and then we have the
quarterback and then we have the other players now the pituitary has a front part called the anterior
part and then a back part called the posterior part now as far as functions go eighty percent of
the function is going to be more for the anterior part so with the back part the posterior part
we have two main hormones okay oxytocin which does a lot of things but the two main functions has to
do with pregnancy the releasing of breast milk and the contraction of the uterus then we have
another hormone called vasopressin which has to do with the retention of fluid in the kidney okay
it's called the antidiuretic hormone so it keeps the water in the body so you're more hydrated now
on the anterior part or the front part of the pituitary so we have a lot of different things
going on we have the control of the thyroid okay so it tells the thyroid to release its hormone
we have the control of the adrenal the outside of the adrenal which is the endocrine part the
release of cortisol and other hormones and so that little tiny part of the pituitary is going to send
its communication down into the adrenals and tell it to release its hormone and then we have
another couple of hormones which i'm not going to necessarily get bogged down with the names but
it's going to tell the gonads both the ovary and the testicle to release its hormones
and then we have prolactin which does several things but one of the main things it does is
it goes to the breast tissue and it's involved in lactation breastfeeding and then we have a
communication that goes to the liver and that's growth hormone and the growth hormone is going
to go to the liver and tell another hormone what to do it's called igf number one which is kind of
an extension off the growth hormone and then we also have two hormone-like proteins and enkephalins
and endorphins that help decrease pain so we have the hypothalamus that tells the pituitary what to
do the pituitary then sends communication through various body tissues releasing various hormones
that create different functions and then once those hormones do their function a communication
is sent back up to the pituitary and the hypothalamus as a way of complying to the order
and so then that communication can be turned off so as soon as it does its function then we have a
turn off mechanism going on now some of these hormones are on an automatic thing it's called a
circadian wave for example the menstrual cycle the sleep cycle growth hormone elevates during sleep
the ovary mechanism happens once a month so you have a lot of complexities going on
but the simplicity of this mechanism is similar to um your thermostat so when it's hot in a room the
thermostat adjusts and it starts cooling off and it's all on automatic depending on what you set
so the body has certain set stable standard things that it operates off of like a temperature usually
of 98.6 blood pressure 120 over 80 pulse rate 72 etc etc and so everything is based on these
these set points and then what happens as the environment changes your body will adapt through
this endocrine system all for the purpose of keeping you alive and healthy all right there
you go that's the simplicity of the pituitary hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

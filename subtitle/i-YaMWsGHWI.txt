hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you a great technique
to get rid of upper neck tension okay so this is especially good if you've been
in a whiplash injury or you have a lot of stiff neck problems now it could be
coming from your digestion which could be in your case because you're pregnant
so what's happening the digestion creates problems with nerves down here
and they can travel up but here's another technique you can do and what
you're going to do is you can do this on yourself
or do it in somewhat someone else so right underneath the jaw you have all
these muscles that attach to this little bone right here okay so right underneath
here so the first thing you do and you can take your fingers right underneath
the jaw bone the mandible and you're just massaging the tightness on anything
and it can be very very very tender and we inch our way forward like right
through in here I can feel there's big knots right there okay now if I was
going to do it myself I'll take my thumb and kind of stretch it like this
okay looks kind of funny so we're going to come up there and we're just going to
inch our way around the mandible and if I'm going to find a tight spot I'm just
going to stretch it like this okay I'm going to work myself all the way around
is that okay is it more tender right here yeah yeah
it's like a big knot okay so what I would do is I can do this side
stretching all the muscles through here and what you're going to feel your neck
feels this is really loose it's going to loosen the back part okay because it's
going to create more space but we're not done so right here there's a little bone
right in the mid part of your neck right here it's a little floating bone that
has muscles from here that attach to it and then from here down here so what you
do is you take the mid part of your neck like go ahead and take your your neck
and don't choke yourself so we take this bone and we raise it up as we tilt our
head back lift it up yeah good relax good do it again
very good okay so we're we're stretching all these muscles articulation between
this muscle in this bone and then this this bone in the top part of the muscles
okay go ahead and do it a little bit more we're going to stretch good do it
again good she's lifting that up okay good now
tell me how much your neck feels looser yeah it loosens your neck completely up
you know we always work on the back part of the neck but if you work on the front
part of the neck you can release the back especially you had a whiplash yes
yeah so if you had a whiplash what happens in all this tightens up but
everyone neglects the muscles here like when you get a massage you never work on
the front for the muscles right never they work on the back part so this is a
highly neglected part okay now step two is you can take the muscles up
underneath the collarbone okay and our two
for stretch your head back and lift go forward lift okay so I'm going to have
you do it on yourself just go ahead and touch touch your
underneath your collarbone with your thumb yeah right there
now lift that up as you tilt your head back good good come back forward so I'm
going to lift up underneath my collarbone and stretch back here so I'm
actually stretching the space between the collarbone okay and the and
the rib underneath it and there's a little muscle there and there's a lot of
scar tissue that develops we want to make it a little bit taller so we're
going to stretch that on both sides now if I was doing it I can use my fingers but
you could just take either a massage tool or your finger and work around your
clavicle and stretch it up this way you can use your thumb all the way through
here think I have my microphone I'm messing it up probably and then you can
work all the way around to here tilt right back and lift and lift okay so
that will take all the back part of your neck tension out of there so don't
forget to do the front part and go ahead and apply this and write your comments
below I'll see in the next video

so I wanted to create a video on the 23 benefits of OMAD one meal a day diet
which is not really a diet it's a kind of a type of intermittent fasting well
you're going 23 hours of fasting in 1 hour of eating and yes people love food
but you could actually set it up so let's say you have a social event or you
go out to dinner and that's when your meal is to your own friends so you're
not sitting there at a restaurant just like not eating that would be not good
but let's talk about the benefits number one you can save a lot of money when
you're only eating one meal a day you'll probably save at least $600 a month just
on that alone it's going to save a lot of time so you can do other things that
are productive most people spend a lot of time eating preparing for food takes
a lot of work number three improving digestion you're gonna give your
gallbladder a chance to rest the stomach the pancreas the large bowel especially
if they have irritable bowel syndrome it'll actually help you heal that it
improves the immune system also it puts your body into something called autophagy
which is the recycling of junk proteins and damaged protein particles and
recycles it into new tissue but it also recycles viruses fungus mold Candida
which also is going to help your immune system right there so it's kind of an
immune strengthening activity you're gonna live longer which is a good thing
you're gonna be a lot less hungry you would think by not eating you're going
to be starving all the time but not when you totally adapt to fat-burning your
hunger is gonna go away no more cravings it's gonna make it really easy to do
this but of course it takes a while to get into this keto state but when you're
fully there you're not going to crave any more better skin because of the
autophagy and the anti-aging effects your skin is going to be a lot smoother and
younger increased energy tons of physical energy number eleven increased
mood if you're depressed you have anxiety you have to realize that comes
from a blood sugar problem when that's handled you're gonna your mood is going
to come way up you're gonna feel much better number twelve increase cognitive
function this is great for dementia improving
your memory focus concentration all that will improve 13 decrease inflammatory
conditions whether you have bursitis tendinitis arthritis that's going to go
away because the blood sugar issues will cause inflammatory number thirteen
decrease inflammatory conditions whether your bursitis tendinitis arthritis or
even rheumatoid arthritis this is great for that decrease blood pressure okay
what causes blood pressure is high insulin so this program will decrease
insulin your blood pressure will come down number fifteen heart disease if
there's one thing that will improve your arteries it's doing in a minute fasting
more than probably any other thing that you can possibly do if we take the
reverse of that and do high insulin and you have insulin resistance and you're a
diabetic you are gonna have a lot of problems in your arteries number 16
improving dementia okay that's related to the cognitive
function and number 17 is definitely going to improve if you have diabetes
it's going to actually help prevent diabetes it's going to improve the
pre-diabetes which is insulin resistance it's going to improve if not fix
hypoglycemia which so many people have they don't even know they have that
number 18 it's going to actually help you if you have a fatty liver it will
take that off the liver number 19 it's going to turn your body into a
fat-burning machine on steroids you're gonna lose your belly you're
gonna get a flat belly which is really cool
number 20 it's gonna really help your discipline because you're doing
something that is almost an exercise in discipline or strengthening your
self-discipline and that's going to improve because your ability to was
stayin from food for 23 hours so it'll improve your your willpower and your
discipline over that 21 improve your muscle physiology muscle density and you
would think by not eating you would worsen your muscles not the case you go
through a whole thing where your growth hormone improves that's the anti-aging
hormone but growth hormone has a protective factor against muscle loss so
this is very important especially if you want to improve your muscle density and
muscle mass number 22 it'll actually fix your metabolic rate if you have a slow
metabolism this is the thing you need to do to finally raise it and actually get
the fat off number 23 it's really gonna improve your mental clarity a lot of
times people we even feel like this euphoric feeling you're gonna feel
really good all this and they start eating and then they feel worse okay so

intended and I will see you in the next video hey before you go definitely sign

so here's a question how much alcohol does a person actually drink per year now
really depends on what country that you live in and also if you're male or female men drink
a lot more than women despite the different phrases you might hear with distressed moms
drinking mommy juice or having a wine o'clock whatever that means but in the u.s the trend
is definitely going up for the amount of alcohol consumption per year presently in the u.s per year
an average american consumes about 2.5 gallons of alcohol or 9.5 liters of alcohol now even
now the trend for drinking more alcohol is going up in the u.s we're still i think rated about 48
in the entire world there's other countries that drink a lot more nigerians consume 3.4 gallons of
alcohol every single year or 13 liters but first place goes to the country of belarus they consume
4.6 gallons of alcohol every year which is 17.5 liters now these figures are somewhat misleading
let's just talk about the u.s for a second in the u.s 30 of the population does not drink
i'm in that category another 30 of americans drink less than one drink per week okay that's 60
but 10 of americans consume the lion's share of alcohol it's more than 10 drinks
every single day and of course this comes up to 70. so the other 30 is right in between
this and this and so if you look at this average it's not that every single american is consuming
you know more than one drink a day it's really certain people are drinking a lot and certain
people are not drinking hardly anything at all and of course a lot of people drink to reduce
stress and it's very addicting and so i want to talk about a couple things that relate to this
the problem with alcohol is what it does to the liver there are certain enzymes in the liver
that break down alcohol into certain chemicals and some of those chemicals are way more toxic
than the alcohol itself and so when the alcohol depletes the vitamins and antioxidants
that are supposed to protect the liver that protection gets lost so we have a lot of free
radical damage we have a lot of liver cells that get destroyed and we have a lot of oxidation
which then leads to scar tissue not to mention a fatty liver and sometimes that deficiency creates
the need for more alcohol so this kind of goes back and forth right here there's a really really
good substitute for those people that want to reduce their alcohol or or come off alcohol
that is kombucha tea now the key with kombucha tea is to read the back the label to make sure that
you don't buy the one that's over two grams of sugar per serving size you want the kombucha tea
with the lowest amount of sugar but kombucha tea has a very similar texture to champagne or beer
it's very carbonated it's somewhat thick and when you drink it it has certain things in it that can
not necessarily make you feel like you're drinking alcohol but make you very very relaxed and it does
have a very very small amount of alcohol but it's not the alcohol that does anything it's the
certain natural chemicals in kombucha tea that are very relaxing and so that's a really good
substitute i recommend it the other thing that i think is very important is taking nutritional
yeast on a regular basis you can get in a powder you can get a pill form i'll put a link down below
for more information on that but taking enough vitamins especially nutritional yeast because
it has the b vitamins can prevent the loss of some of the vitamins that are depleted from the alcohol
and not just protect the liver but decrease the cravings for alcohol as well as reduce the stress
or the need for alcohol even more so these two things are probably the most important two things
that you want to recommend for someone that is weaning themselves off of alcohol all right so
last question is and i'm real curious go ahead and type in the comment section below of how much
alcohol do you consume per week all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

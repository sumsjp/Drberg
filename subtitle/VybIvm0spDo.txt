i'm going to show you some ways to boost your discipline with keto and exercise
so when i was in my 20s my diet was the worst okay and i started having health problems and you would
think that i would change and be motivated but it took me a long time before i started becoming more
consistent and having discipline not to mention exercise in fact i don't think i worked out
for 15 years in my 20s and 30s but now i have very good discipline with exercise
and staying consistent so i just want to let you know it's possible to go from terrible discipline
to good discipline so what is discipline it's self-control it's restraint over impulses that
are countering your progress or certain emotions that maybe you might not feel like you want to
exercise or stick to the program or you might have certain desires or temptations that can throw you
off so let's kind of go through this list here number one people are not naturally lazy if you
thought you were lazy you're really not chances are you're just tired people with lots of energy
are in action they're doing things they're not lazy so if you feel like you're lazy we just
need to energize you so how do you do that you first start the keto plan number one this if done
correctly will generate a lot of energy so you can exercise and so i wouldn't necessarily recommend
if you're exhausted to start exercising first let's get some energy so you feel like you can
do this right here when i talk to people i talk to a lot of people i find out they're not really
doing keto correctly so one of the things that we're going to be doing very soon is having online
classes to teach everyone to orientate them on how to do keto correctly from the very beginning
so then they actually can be successful a to b number two you need to raise your emotion
people that are higher emotionally naturally have good discipline because your emotion controls your
behavior and maybe you need some help music is a really good tool to increase your emotion
all right and then you have friends right they can you can actually partner with them to do the
same eating plan or exercise or even hanging out with very very upbeat people if you want to find
some of those friends i put a link down below you can order them online they'll be shipped to your
house and then they you can hang out with them all day long and you'll feel really good next
point is just to speed up so the faster you speed up the higher the emotion if you ever notice like
a bum on the street who's very apathetic are they in motion they are literally completely solid no
motion whatsoever and then you have those people that are really in action all the time they're
talking fast they're moving fast they normally have very very high discipline they get things
done and they don't usually have a problem with staying consistent so you want to speed up and you
want to raise your emotion all right number three find a trainer a personal trainer will always push
you way further than you can push yourself and then even a coach or like a keto health coach a
coach can give you the information that you're missing that will make a world of difference
number four you want to keep keep your word that's your integrity in fact every time you keep your
word you start building up your willpower more and more and more and you can actually
trust yourself because you have more integrity and so if you say you're going to do something
you do it and then on the flip side every time you say you're going to do it and you don't
do it and that happens over and over it lowers your own personal integrity and it makes it very
very difficult for you even to believe yourself as a therapy above everything else this is probably
the most important thing all right number five make it easy to do for example
instead of doing some complex recipe just do like a one minute recipe where you're just combining a
couple foods or maybe just start out with a 10-minute exercise or walk around the block
because something is better than nothing now a lot of you watching this have very good discipline
so if you have a successful action that has helped you put it in the comment i'm always looking for
good tips to share with other people hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

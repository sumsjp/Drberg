so here's a question for today why are 95
of your bile salts recycled now i know you've been
thinking about this for a very long time well i finally created a video just for
you because there's this idea that your
gallbladder is unneeded and bile is something that is highly
confused highly underrated ignored especially
when we get into the gallbladder in fact many doctors
will say the gallbladder is unnecessary well it's only necessary if you'd
understand what it does because that gallbladder
concentrates this bile but the gallbladder concentrates
the bile so it can create the effects that it
needs to create in fact there's six really important
things that bile will do so your body actually recycles
bile because it is vitally necessary and important in fact it
recycles it six to ten times every single day
and on top of that your liver makes bile it's called
primary bile salts and your microbiome makes bile that's called secondary bile
salts i'll come back to this but i'm just trying to increase your
awareness on the importance of bile in your body
and how many conditions are connected to problems with your bile
it's quite extensive all right let's first talk about
the six things that bile will do and there's other things but these are the
six most important things number one it
helps you absorb fats in fact most fats are dependent on bile
for the absorption and if you remove the gallbladder you no
longer have the concentration so you're going to be deficient in bile
all right number two it helps you absorb fat soluble nutrients notice i didn't
say vitamins because fat soluble nutrients
not only are the vitamin a d e k 1 k 2 and also the omega 3 fatty
acids which are very very important as well as the phytonutrients
many phytonutrients like all the carotenoids
which is a pre-vitamin a type phytonutrient
it's fat soluble so those things are dependent on bile
like lutein for example is a carotenoid that helps
prevent macular degeneration so there's just a lot of things that are dependent
on this bile also bio helps prevent
sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth we don't want
bacteria or very much of it in our small intestine
because if there is friendly bacteria in your small intestine
it will then eat up your nutrients it competes
for nutrients so there'll be less nutrients going into your
a small intestine because the microbes need them to survive
so you're going to be deficient in nutrients you're going to have a lot of
gas bloating overgrowth of other pathogens
unfriendly bacteria so bile cells have antimicrobial
properties so they basically go through the small intestine
kill off the microbes make sure there's nothing growing in there
and then get reabsorbed at the last part of the small intestine before it goes
into the large intestine and the whole cycle starts again so this
is very very important in preventing this so many people have
this so if you eat especially like fiber or probiotics and
you bloat then chances are you could have sibo
number four bile salts help regulate cholesterol now there's nothing wrong
with cholesterol but there is a type of cholesterol which
is the small dense particles the ldl particles that can invade the
vascular system and create damage so bile just happens to regulate
cholesterol so if there's too much cholesterol consumed or your
body makes too much the excess goes out with the bile
without bile you can't get rid of the excess and
cholesterol can then back up into the skin
and you'll see certain conditions like people will have little cholesterol
spots around their eyelids they need bile salts also
bile salts help rid toxins and poisons heavy metals pesticides very important
and bile also helps with your immune system
now if you don't have enough bile or it's not being recycled because there's
liver damage let's see if a fatty liver or your liver is inflamed
or you have cirrhosis or you have some type of malabsorption issue
in the small intestine or the large and you're deficient in bile here are
some things that could happen cholesterol can go high like i said
before it's high cholesterol is not a problem
but it could be a problem if it's the wrong kind okay number two
gallstone formation or sludge in the bile ducts or the gallbladder
which can then back things up into your liver and cause
pain over the right side over here or right side of the neck right here or
shoulder or right side fibromyalgia or even
pancreatitis because you can have sludge or stone
stuck in one of the ducts and create a lot of pain in your digestive system so
um bile salts help keep things flowing number three
low vitamin a this can relate to all sorts of things related to sinus
vision like can't see in the dark dry eyes blurry vision for immune system
vitamin d vitamin d has to do with heart and it's a very powerful antioxidant and
also it helps fertility and your pituitary as
a precursor to making certain hormones and then vitamin k1 to prevent
unnecessary bleeding and k2 to remove calcium from the wrong places so
removing it from the arteries and the joints and keeping it in the
bone low omega-3 fatty acids which is very
common great percentage of population just does not
have enough omega-3 so they have real heavy on the omega-6
so they'll have all sorts of inflammatory issues and
if you're low on omega-3 you could increase blood sugar issues and have
more problems with insulin resistance number five
you're not going to be satisfied after a meal so you eat a meal and you're just
not satisfied because you don't have the bile to
pull in the fats to go to the brain and turn off the hunger signals
we've already talked about sibo seven constipation because
bile uh kind of lubricates the colon so without enough bile
things get backed up you also need bile to help convert
t4 to t3 so that could be the reason why you have hypothyroidism
something wrong with that conversion and then you take synthroid or t4
and you wonder why it's not really working because the problem
is this not being converted to t3 which is the active form
and then because bile helps rid toxins you're not able to detoxify the liver so
things back up and you become very very toxic now
one last point i wanted to mention about primary and secondary bile salts this is
might be a new thing for you so i'm going to try to explain it very simply
so what is the difference between primary and secondary
bile well primary is conjugated this means you're attaching
an amino acid like either taurine or glycine to the
bile to make it more water-soluble so it can
move and also be absorbed into your intestines right
what happens when this conjugated bile goes through the intestines at the
very end part certain microbes
take off these amino acids and then make them insoluble so they're
less water soluble so they can be recycled so you have less
absorption so that's the difference between the
primary and secondary all right thanks for watching before you
go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin
keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

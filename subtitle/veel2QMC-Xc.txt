let's talk about arugula it's actually an amazing vegetable i consume arugula on a
regular basis in fact i like this better than spinach better than other types of lettuce leaf
i put in my salad you don't have to really add a lot of things to that salad base because arugula
naturally has a great flavor it's kind of peppery spicy hot and sweet at the same time
so sometimes i'll put a little extra virgin olive oil high quality by the way and a little bit of
vinaigrette karen doesn't even use that she just uses extra virgin olive oil arugula has some
very interesting properties number one has anti-cancer properties so there's a lot of
different plant chemicals that can help reduce the risk of cancer because arugula is part of
the cruciferous family number two it's high in calcium it's high in potassium it's high in folate
it's high in vitamin c it's high in vitamin k1 and it's also high in the pre-vitamin
a beta-carotene which is a carotenoid which has many other properties now this pre-vitamin a
has to be converted to the active form which is very insignificant but there's many great things
about this pre-vitamin a that can help you number three it's low in oxalates which is great because
that can help you reduce kidney stones if you are a stone former and also oxalates tend to block
the absorption of minerals so you'll absorb more minerals if you consume things that are low in
oxalates also foods that are high in oxalates like almonds and spinach and chocolate and
kiwi can create like symptoms of arthritis sometimes too so it's not as common as you might
think but it can do that number four it is great flavor like i just mentioned number five it's
great for your cardiovascular system it has great anti-inflammatory properties and it also can help
decrease the risk of clotting probably because it's high in vitamin k1 all right number seven
arugula has been known to increase libido and also help in erectile dysfunction in fact it was used
as an aphrodisiac back in the roman times there's not a lot of studies on this i did find one study
it was involving mice and the mechanism of action is that it increases nitrates which
is part of nitric oxide which increases blood flow but basically that's the mechanism of how
viagra works by increasing this nitric oxide so will it actually cure your libido i have no idea
give it a shot but of course if someone is not on keto and they're eating junk food and they're
eating arugula thinking that that's going to actually do something it's probably not going to
do anything all right comment down below on your thoughts on arugula and if you like it hey before

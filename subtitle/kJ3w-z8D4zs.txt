now isn't it interesting that certain foods that look like certain body parts have
properties and compounds that support that body part let's start with walnuts just so happens they
look exactly like your brain and they happen to be the only nut that is very high in
ala which is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be converted into epa and dha which are probably
the most important fatty acid of your brain in fact without dha which is an omega-3 fatty acid
your brain cannot work and no other nut has even close the amounts of ala than the walnut also
walnuts contain melatonin which is also good for your brain as well and then we have the kidney
bean which looks like the kidney now i don't recommend kidney beans but i find it interesting
that kidney beans are high in arginine which is an amino acid that can help detoxify ammonia
from your kidneys and your liver and the kidney is one of the organs that gets damaged from diabetes
and so kidney beans have certain things that can decrease the damage to the kidney then we have
the tomato if you cut a tomato in half it looks very similar to the chambers of the heart and
tomatoes are loaded with something called lycopene which is a phytonutrient that has been proven to
decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease what a coincidence and lastly we have broccoli now
broccoli doesn't necessarily mimic a body part but it does look like a cancer bud and out of all the
vegetables broccoli being a cruciferous vegetable is loaded with a very specific phytonutrient
that targets cancer in a big way called sulfurophane and it's especially high in broccoli
sprouts anyway i thought it was an interesting connection between certain foods and body parts
and their health benefits before you go if you have a question about a product

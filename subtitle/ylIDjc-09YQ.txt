let's talk about natural flavors sometimes people think that natural flavors mean vegan no they
don't let's differentiate natural flavors versus artificial flavoring so the question is how do
they make flavoring taste like something and keep it natural well they use the essence of something
they might use a spice some extract fruit fruit juice veggie veggie juice edible yeast herbs bark
buds of plants roots of plants leafs of plants but they also use meat seafood poultry and
egg that's right so when you have a plant-based veggie burger how do you think they get it to
taste like a burger well this is how they do it they use animal products i just wanted to
bring this to your attention if you think that it's completely vegan well usually
it's not now personally i don't have a problem with that because i'm not a vegan
but what i want to do is to raise awareness on the difference between natural flavors
versus artificial flavoring artificial flavoring has to do with synthetic chemicals
that could be coming from petroleum or other chemicals the molecules are similar but
they're definitely not the same now here's another point that i want to bring up that
because i produce certain supplements that require flavoring there's one thing that a lot of people
don't realize when you have dry flavors compared to liquid you have to use various carriers to make
them dry okay and the most common carrier is maltodextrin which is the highest thing on the
glycemic index it is way higher than pure glucose okay glucose is like 100 maltodextrin i think is
like 120 it could be even more so it's it's not keto friendly but they use that in the flavors
so i just wanted to bring that to your attention all my products do not use maltodextrin we use a
different carrier i think it's called acacia gum another point the fda doesn't require
labels to indicate what's in their natural flavoring that's just another point i want to
bring up and so you this is why you might see it on a vegan label when you buy chicken from
the store if you look on the ingredient a lot of times it'll say natural flavoring why do they have
to add flavoring to the chickens because chicken is so bland and they have to make it taste like
drinking so they're actually going to add chicken flavoring to chicken and they also do it with pork
and beef so read your labels so last point i want to bring up is monosodium glutamate can also be
disguised as natural flavorings i mean in the past i remember eating certain foods that had
natural flavorings but had no msg and the food just tasted too good and i do know that when i
consume food with msg first of all i'll be hungry in about an hour and a half and i'll be very very
thirsty because the amount of sodium glutamate and that's what occurred after i ate that food so
read the labels use judgment and realize that just because it's natural doesn't mean that it's vegan

there's another study that i read recently that talks about vitamin d levels linked to depressed
teens so i want to talk about that one of the symptoms of a vitamin d deficiency would be
sadness hopelessness but there's many more too loss of interest loss of concentration even
thoughts of suicide is linked to a low vitamin d level which is quite incredible the problem
is that not only does this involve teens but it affects everyone in fact 75 of the population has
low vitamin d levels now specifically for teens here's the problem first of all they don't get
enough sun they're indoors on the computer a lot of times they don't consume enough vegetables to
get magnesium which is essential for vitamin d to work so they usually have magnesium deficiencies
as well teenagers tend to snack a lot that creates insulin resistance which also blocks vitamin d
they're usually on a high carb diet which creates insulin resistance which blocks vitamin d and if
they're consuming fructose as in high fructose corn syrup that can block vitamin d more than
glucose actually now if a teen is overweight or obese that can increase the need for vitamin d
so that's going to exaggerate the vitamin d deficiency and also if they have darker skin
that can block vitamin d absorption from the uv light now other symptoms of a vitamin d deficiency
is achy joints low back pain lethargy insomnia anxiety so this is a very very simple solution to
a very big problem unfortunately a lot of kids are then put on antidepressant medication when i think
they should just take some vitamin d 10,000 IUs and i would also include magnesium with it i
would also include vitamin k2 because all of those together will enhance the absorption of vitamin d3
and actually greatly elevate the mood in addition to giving your teen vitamin d i would also highly
recommend getting them to get out in the sun consume more vegetables right stop the snacking
there's something called intermittent fasting if you're not familiar with this i put a link
down below and get on a low carb diet which is in that same link down below
because that will greatly improve the metabolism and help them lose weight and help them actually
absorb vitamin d all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

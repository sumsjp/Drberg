now this is just an interesting topic to me it might be interesting to you
but most drugs come from nature and if you do research on natural remedies you always have
certain groups in medicine that will say that natural remedies are not scientific but 70 percent
of all drugs in the past 25 years were derived from natural products you just can't patent them
in fact 50 of all anti-cancer drugs since the 40s were either natural products or came from natural
products now what is the difference between natural products and synthetics natural products
are have a much more complex chemistry okay and synthetics man-made chemicals have much more
simple chemistry and this means that the simple chemistry can bind with a lot more receptors
in the body and give you a lot more side effects it's the complex chemicals that have more specific
actions and cannot bind with as many receptors and create problems so let's give you some uh
comparable alternatives to certain medications let's start with ibuprofen curcumin has been
found to be just as effective for pain control as ibuprofen now curcumin has also been found to
be just as effective as prozac for depression and anxiety and then we get to metformin berberine has
similar effects to metformin and just as a side note if you're on any of these medications i'm not
telling you to switch over or replace them with natural remedies check with your doctor before
doing that and if you're on metformin by the way make sure you're taking vitamin b1 or nutritional
yeast that has natural b1 because metformin can deplete your b1 and create other issues statins
okay for high cholesterol garlic and olive oil have great anti-cholesterol properties then we
have lisinopril which is a high blood pressure medication parsley garlic thyme and cinnamon have
been shown to actually help lower blood pressure then we have ppis which are proton pump inhibitors
to help you with acid in your stomach slippery elm bark forms a gel and it can have similar
effects to help lower acid in the stomach but anyway i just wanted to create this short video
to remind people that most of these drugs come from nature so if you're enjoying my

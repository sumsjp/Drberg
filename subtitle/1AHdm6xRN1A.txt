hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about the best vitamin k2 foods okay now you
may be heard of vitamin k1 that has to do with clotting vitamin k2 is very very different it
has to do with the mobilization of calcium in your body especially if it's in the wrong place so if
you have excess calcium in the arteries or in the joints or other places that are making you stiff
affecting the heart calcification and arteries which are increasing your blood pressure your
vitamin 2 deficient vitamin 2 with the help of d3 has the capacity to extract this buildup of
calcium and put it right into the bones to make your bones really strong and it just so
happens that a lot of people are deficient because they've been avoiding all the fatty
foods that they've been taught that cause artery problems like grass-fed butter meats dairy hard
cheese soft cheese goose liver and chicken liver salami egg yolk things like that so basically
these foods have button and k2 and of course you're not going to get improvement if you're
also consuming sugar and alcohol and things like that but if you have a healthy diet and include
these foods it actually is very beneficial to the calcium deposits in your body that are in
the wrong place but you can also if you're a vegan vegetarian you could actually get it from natto
which is a fermented soy product make sure it's non-gmo and also even sauerkraut and even miso
okay you can get some k2 in that bank goodness that that's available but interesting because
these are the foods that we've been taught to avoid when in fact we should have been okay
with consuming these alright put your comments below I'll talk to you soon hey guys thank you

so we're going to talk about how to be calm instantly now the sensation of being calm
is greatly affected by your neurotransmitters neurotransmitters are very similar to hormones
but instead of traveling through the blood they travel through the nervous system
so the neurotransmitter gaba is inhibitory so it calms things down it relaxes a person
it can decrease impulses and i'm talking about unhealthy impulses to do certain things
it decreases anxiety panic attack it can greatly affect your mood and decrease depression
in fact during happy hour you're happy because you're drinking alcohol for that one hour
of course if you kept drinking you're going to be very unhappy
but what produces that happiness in happy hour is the gaba that's increased and then when you look
at what happens when you have these withdrawal symptoms you have a decrease in gaba this is why
you have more anxiety restlessness you can't calm down you can't stop moving you definitely cannot
sleep and that's because of the gaba well it just so happens to be a very inexpensive natural thing
that you can actually drink you can also get this in a supplement but it's lemon balm tea
the phytonutrient in the lemon balm plant has been demonstrated to significantly increase calmness
and there's quite a few other herbs that have this phytonutrient but lemon balm based on the research
that i'm reading shown to give major improvements in calmness so that was it for the video very
simple this is what i would recommend as a way to stay calm you can drink it through the day

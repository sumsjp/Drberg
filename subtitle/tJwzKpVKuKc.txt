today we're going to talk about prolonged fasting and
igf number one now what is igf number one i've done other videos on
this and it stands for insulin like growth factor
number one it's a hormone that is made in the liver
it's stimulated by growth hormone and it acts like growth hormone in the
body so it's kind of an extension of growth hormone
growth hormone is made by the pituitary it goes down the liver
it triggers the liver to make igf now igf
is vitally important to the growth and development of tissues in the body
so whatever the functions of growth hormone are
those are the same functions as igf and when you're not eating insulin goes
down igf goes up to mobilize fat to actually give you
fuel so it's one of the fat burning hormones so it's a
vital hormone but when you look through the research on this
there's an association to increasing the risk of
cancer if igf is too high now it's not that igf number one
is not the sole cause of cancer it's involved in cancer because it's a
anabolic hormone it makes things grow and it inhibits
something called apoptosis so this is where
certain cells like cancer cells commit suicide
well igf number one can inhibit that so that can kind of counter your body's
ability to get rid of cancer so it's known to promote cancer
prostate breasts liver cancer but you have to realize there's a lot of
other things that have to happen in your body for you to get cancer
definitely you have to have damage to the mitochondria
you have to have a shift in that metabolism to fermenting glucose
so the only reason i'm bringing this up is to show you
another huge benefit that occurs when you do prolong fasting
as i mentioned before when you donate insulin goes down
and then the igf number one goes up so when you fast for three to five days
you get a pretty good decrease in igf number one
like a 30 decrease you're also getting a major decrease in glucose
you're tapping out your glycogen reserve in your liver
you're decreasing insulin so your immune system starts to thrive your
inflammation goes down which is always connected to the spread of
cancer and you have all sorts of amazing neural
regenerative things that happen like your brain cells
start growing also if you have pcos this is essential to do periodically
when you do a fast for greater than five days when you get into five to seven
days or even longer you create a much
deeper drop in igf number one like a 60 drop also you get a massive drop in
glucose and insulin so you just created an
environment in your body where cancer just absolutely cannot exist
not only are you starving it it's fuel and glutamate which is an amino acid
that can fuel cancer too so you you're not consuming any glutamate so
that's going to be down and you're dropping igf number one so
you're going to make it next to impossible for cancer cells to
survive also you're going to find that you're
going to clear up diabetes type 2 and you're basically just going to live
longer so doing a longer fast every so often
is extremely therapeutic to your body now if anyone tells you that prolonged
fasting is harmful to your body or it's starving
i'm going to put some links down below for you to just look at to show you that
it's absolutely really good for your survival
of your cells to do periodic prolonged fasting now if you've
never done it before you want to ease up into it and gradually do it
and definitely take nutrients while you're fasting but you're going to find
that after a day or two your hunger is going
to be completely gone you're going to have energy
your cognitive function is going to go up it's going to be very very beneficial
at three days into your fast your cells start to resist stress and toxins so
they become stronger which is just a survival mechanism it's
quite fascinating the point of this video is just to increase your awareness
on the benefits of prolonged fasting periodically
especially for cancer and also just to make you aware of what's happening with
igf this is not a bad hormone it's just that
when you do fasting you're not just merely starving the cancer of fuel
you're doing some other very powerful things as well
thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin
keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

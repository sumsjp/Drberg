so recently i had this idea that i was
going to try some mct oil before i went
to bed and normally you would take mct
oil
in the morning to get more energy or
even before you work out to actually run
your body in ketones
but
i thought about sleep apnea sleep apnea
is a condition of a lack of oxygen which
interferes with your ability to sleep
and i do know there's a huge connection
between breathing air getting oxygen
and actually sleeping for some reason we
don't sleep well when we don't get
oxygen
ketones
give you oxygen give you more oxygen
than glucose also you're getting less
co2 carbon dioxide
now what happens with the brain is this
it prefers ketones if there's enough
ketones in your blood
if you're just starting out in ketosis
and you're not necessarily doing
imminent fasting or you just want to
spike more ketones in your brain
you can actually take mct oil to do that
because it converts to ketones very very
efficiently and it doesn't even use
the bile and some of the digestive
enzymes from the pancreas it just kind
of gets absorbed and it turns into
ketones very very fast so by taking a
small amount of mct oil medium chain
triglycerides i'm talking about starting
off with a half of a teaspoon
because it can
create some digestive issues so start
small and maybe kind of work your way up
to maybe one teaspoon over time
but try this right before you go to bed
i've been doing it for the last week and
it does definitely increase the quality
of sleep for sure the other cool thing
about ketones in general there are
certain parts of the brain that run on
ketones and other parts that don't well
just so happens that the pineal gland
runs on ketones and that's where you
have the melatonin that helps you sleep
as well
the hypothalamus and the pituitary also
love ketones now in the hypothalamus you
have all these little tiny
nuclei they're little regulatory
cells that are combine the autonomic
nervous system with the endocrine system
and there's one little nuclei called the
suprachiasmatic nuclei that's involved
in the sleep circadian waves and that's
basically your internal clock
if you support it with the right fuel
you could potentially enhance your sleep
and one last point about the brain there
is a lot of confusions on the brain
until fairly recently
it wasn't known that your brain could
actually run on ketones uh it was
thought that the brain could only run on
glucose so sometimes when you talk to
your doctor for example
they might still not even have this new
information that your brain can run on
ketones very efficiently the brain can't
run on fatty acids though other parts of
your body can run in fatty acids but
because the brain is composed of a lot
of fatty acids that would be very
dangerous if you're going to run on your
own
tissue so that's kind of a protective
mechanism but let me know in the
comments below if it actually improves
your sleeping

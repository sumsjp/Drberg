you know zinc is a fascinating trace mineral it's involved in so many different biochemical
reactions but today we're going to talk about the relationship between zinc and your hormones
now zinc is involved in so many different biochemical pathways but it's majorly involved
in quite a few of your hormones in fact it's involved in all of your major hormones let's
go through this first of all there's two pituitary hormones called follicle stimulating hormone and
luteinizing hormone and they send signals down to the gonads both the ovaries and the testicle
so in men luteinizing hormone lh increases testosterone so zinc increases testosterone
if you're zinc deficient your gonads actually shrink you get what's called hypogonadism
so zinc will increase your testosterone now there's also another situation where you have
testosterone turning into a very powerful form of testosterone called dht through a very specific
enzyme called 5-alpha reductase so if there's too much of this enzyme you get too much dht
and one of the problems you get is you get hair loss another problem is prostate enlargement
so zinc helps act as an inhibitor of five alpha reductase limiting the amount
of dht you get now when a female follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone
control estrogen and progesterone zinc will help increase progesterone as well as estrogen
unless you have estrogen dominance which i'm going to get to in a second
but so many women during menopause end up having a major deficiency in progesterone and if they took
a little zinc they would actually have more progesterone they would have better ratios
of progesterone to estrogen now if a woman is menopausal she typically has a lot less estrogen
and so zinc can help bring that up to a correct level but you also have another enzyme that
converts testosterone into estrogen it's called aromatase and if there's too much of this hormone
you're going to get estrogen dominance now this can happen in men and women and one of
the things that will increase this enzyme is plastics in the environment and it just
so happens that a really good aromatase inhibitor is zinc so zinc will help you
from developing too much estrogen if you're a male or a female then we get to growth hormone which is
the main fat-burning hormone it's an anti-aging hormone it has everything to do with regulating
and helping you make new proteins in the body and it just so happens in zinc supports normal growth
hormone levels as well as another hormone that is an extension of growth hormone which is made
by your liver called igf number one then we get to the thyroid in order for you to convert t4
the inactive form of the thyroid hormone to t3 which is the active form you need zinc you also
need selenium and you also need iodine but zinc is very important in this conversion
also zinc is needed by the pituitary and the thyroid to make more of its thyroid hormone
and then lastly let's talk about insulin okay insulin is a very important hormone
and it's very important not to have too much of this hormone so zinc helps increase
insulin sensitivity as well as helps inhibit insulin resistance thereby decreasing the amount
of insulin so zinc is all about helping your blood sugars helping regulate insulin levels zinc is
intimately involved with so many key hormones so if you're enjoying my content which i hope you are

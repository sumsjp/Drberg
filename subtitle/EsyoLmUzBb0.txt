so i have a question for you what's healthier yogurt
or ice cream well yogurt right not quite let's do the comparison let's
take one cup that's 128 grams ice cream on average has about 28 grams
of sugar per cup but let's take a look at the
sugar in four different yogurts Yoplait
41 grams of sugar per cup compared to ice cream this is off the chart
then we have GoGurt which is 38.2 grams of sugar
Dannon 36 grams of sugar then we have Dannon Activia 43
grams of sugar but of course these are sweetened with sugar they're not plain
but this blew my mind to actually do a comparison to see how much sugar
is actually in one cup now a lot of these products are either in four ounces
or six ounces and one cup is eight ounces
so if you were to look in the back the label you say oh this is a
little less than ice cream but if you do the calculations
one for one you'll see that it has a tremendous amount of sugar
so you're going to create a huge spike in someone's blood sugars
not to mention the type of sugar a lot of times
using high fructose corn syrup they add modified corn starch which is a flavor
enhancer to make it taste good they put corn syrup but
it's low fat right it has added vitamin a and vitamin d
and it's grade a now what is grade a there are two types of milk
grade a is primarily used for direct sales and consumption in stores
and grade b used for indirect consumption such as cheese making and
other processing so that's all grade a means
now i did an assessment on the quantity of certain
foods that someone consumed back in 1970 versus 2015. check this out
beef from this time period this time period it went down
by 33 chicken spiked up by a hundred and sixteen percent corn
products went up by 180 corn sweeteners
went up by 300 percent grains went up by 127 percent
soy went up by 190 vegetable oils went up by 270 but look at this
yogurt went up by 1600 percent now when i first saw this
i kind of like downplayed it and i didn't put attention on it because i'm
thinking yogurt can't be that bad but this
is significantly higher because back in 1970s we didn't consume as much yogurt
and this could be potentially one of the significant factors of adding all this
sugar into the diet and creating insulin
resistance in so many people i would recommend if you're going to
consume yogurt make sure you read the back label
make sure it's plain make sure it's whole milk
i would highly recommend getting a bulgarian yogurt if you're going to do
that kefir is even a little bit better it has
more microbes and less sugar definitely don't get the added sugar or
sweeteners or even vanilla has a lot of sugar in it
you can put drops of stevia in there as your sweetener if you want
but if you have this idea that yogurt is a health food in any way shape or
form with this amount of sugar
it's not
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains

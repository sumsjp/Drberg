let's talk about ulcerative colitis a very nasty condition
where you have inflammation in your colon which is the last part of your
digestive tract and the rectum with ulcers with bleeding
and the problem is there's only really two solutions medically
one is surgery and the other one is steroids
so i don't like these two solutions because as soon as you do the steroids
you might feel better but then the next time you do it
you need more and more and more and more until the point where you become
resistant to steroids and has a lot of side
effects as well and of course surgery is not the ultimate solution because the
purpose of the colon is to absorb water and electrolytes
so if you're not able to reabsorb water and recycle water you're going to be
dehydrated not to mention the importance of
electrolytes as well on the heart also the colon houses most of your
microbiome so if you don't have that flora there to help you make
vitamins help your immune system you're gonna
have a lot of issues and a lot of skin issues
as well so i want to give you some other things to do
naturally to help if you have ulcerative colitis it's an autoimmune
condition which means your own immune system
is creating a constant irritation and inflammation to the colon
creating ulcers so the most important thing if you're new to my channel
maybe this is a new thing to you if you're not this is
what you need to do fasting fasting is the most important thing
when you eat six meals a day this is very very bad for ulcerative colitis
because you never give it a chance to heal
so fasting will drop inflammation it will increase the diversity of your
microbiome okay which is interesting you're gonna
not feed these microbes but then they become more diverse they become stronger
they survive better if you feed them too much they get lazy and fat
also you'll have an increase in something called small
chain fatty acids and this is an anti-inflammatory compound
and it helps with insulin resistance it helps with your immune system
so fasting is very very important if you're new to my channel i put a link
down below of how to do intermittent fasting and periodic
prolonged fasting number two zinc zinc is necessary
for any type of ulcers so if you have a zinc deficiency you it increases your
risk of getting an ulcer so you want zinc number three vitamin d and i know
you've probably heard this many many times in fact i had one
comment today on one of my youtube videos that said dr
berg do you recommend fasting and vitamin d for
every single condition and i said just about simply because
it's very very important and if the condition involves
inflammation which is a large percentage of conditions then
these two things are are necessary so vitamin d in higher amounts i'm
talking about 40,000 IUs per day maybe even more for ulcerative
colitis vitamin d is an immune modulator it
controls the immune system it helps to put the
fire out it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory and it
acts like cortisone prednisone but without the
side effects so this is very very important cabbage
juice has some interesting research i'll put a link down below in fact i'll
put a link down below for all the research that i'm
talking about right now cabbage juice certain phytonutrients in cabbage juice
has known properties to help with ulcers
and gastritis and any type of damage in your colon especially
inflammation in fact if you have ulcerative colitis
or celiac or some type of inflammation
in your gut cabbage as a vegetable seems to be
something you probably will be able to digest more than other vegetables
um but for a great majority of people consuming vegetables will irritate their
colon so in that case they have to go more
carnivore for a while maybe two months maybe longer to help
reset and heal the colon because the fiber acts
to irritate the colon but they might do fine with
cabbage but the cabbage juice is something you can actually take
so you want to juice it fresh all right number five
vsl number three this is a very uh powerful probiotic you can get it from
the health food store you can get it online
there's eight strains you would want to take four to eight capsules not right
away you take a very small amount initially
and gradually work up to it because it can create an immune reaction but it
has a count of 900 billion compared to other probiotics which at
the very most it'll be like 20 billion so there's
it's super concentrated and you'd have to take it for
at least a month two months to really start seeing the change because it's a
slow process it's lactose free but it's very very
powerful for ulcerative colitis in any type of inflammatory condition
wheatgrass juice powder has also some interesting studies that i'm going to
put down below to help with any type of
lesions inflammation ulcers on the internal part of your skin the lining
either in the esophagus the stomach the small intestine the large intestine
or apple cider vinegar wheatgrass juice and wheatgrass juice powder is very
beneficial to help the inner skin of the
gut so i think really if you did these things right here
you'll be in a lot better shape and there's very minimal side effects of
these items right here so give it a shot and comment down below

let's talk about the difference between a gallstone and a kidney stone and how the heck
are stones getting inside your body these are all questions we're going to answer let's start with
the kidney stones the most common type of kidney stone is the calcium oxalate stone eighty percent
of all kidney stones are this right here and what's happening is your urine is becoming super
concentrated and the oxalates are forming with the calcium you get high oxalates from certain foods
keto friendly foods spinach almonds too much black tea beets and especially the
beet tops which have the most potassium of any plant and chocolate and there's many
others as well but these are very very high in oxalates one of the best ways to prevent
a calcium oxalate kidney stone realizing that it's a super saturation phenomena
is to consume enough fluid to keep it from saturating and that would be at least two and
a half liters of fluid every single day and if you added some potassium citrate to this
that would be good as well because in order for a calcium oxalate stone to develop
you would need to be also low in citrates okay so if you consume more citrates you can actually
prevent this from forming as well and you can get citrates from lemon juice and so consuming a good
amount of lemon juice in this fluid right here would be a very smart thing there are other types
of kidney stones that are not as common calcium phosphate stones struvite stones which really
relates to a urinary tract infection this is more common in women and uric acid stones which is more
common in men and this really has to do with a weakened or damaged kidney that's not able to
get rid of the uric acid more than anything else it's not being caused just by consuming
too much protein there are certain proteins that can worsen the situation but really the
kidney is not releasing the uric acid properly it's being retained and then you have a cystine
stone and that's more of a genetic issue now i've done a lot of videos on kidney stones
i put some links down below but this right here is the most important thing right there if you're
prone to stones okay gallstones completely different you have a low bile situation
over 80 percent of gallstones are cholesterol stones where the cholesterol is super saturated
and develop a stone but usually the reason why it's super saturated is because there's
not enough bile to keep it thinned and a certain amount of your fat cell is composed of cholesterol
between 25 and 50 percent several things can diminish the production of bile you can have
damage to your liver whether your liver is fatty or there's cirrhosis or there's an infection
also a low-fat diet can increase the risk of eating gallstones because
fat triggers the release of bile so if you don't have enough fat in the diet you never
trigger the bile production so you would think that consuming too much fat will cause
gallstones but that's not the reason it's really not enough fat
and a combination of these other things right here and then we have other situations where you
can increase the risk of getting stones having too much insulin because you're doing too many carbs
or having too much cortisol or stress or having too much estrogen so to decrease the
risk of stones we want to keep this in check keep our stress down and keep estrogen low
and keep enough bile you can also take purified bile salts if you're at risk of getting gallstones
or if you have uh liver damage taking purified bile salts is a very very therapeutic thing
now 20 of the time people develop what's called calcium stones in the gallbladder and those are
primarily related to taking calcium supplements okay specifically the ones that you would get and
i'm not going to mention any brand names but the one that has the first ingredient calcium
carbonate that is basically a rock so of course it's going from that bottle to your mouth
into the gallbladder so just make sure that your supplements are not calcium carbonate
that that's like stones and also i don't really recommend people even take calcium supplements
especially if you're post-menopausal and you're taking this large amount because there's some
risk factors for your heart and it creates a lot of complications i think you should focus on
getting your calcium from the diet but i've done a video on this topic i'll put a link down below hey

so i wanted to create a video on all the different possible reasons that is keeping
you from sleeping i've done a series of videos on sleep and how important it is for everything from
your memory to your metabolism to your blood sugars okay so let's just go through the list
if you have cramping which can keep you up at night it's a simple solution calcium and magnesium
all right hot flashes that could keep you upright iodine in the form of seek help i recommend that
vitamin e in the form of tocatrinols which will support the pituitary which is a key
gland to help prevent high flashes now you can also take calcium diglucrate which can help hot
flashes as well but most of the time it's going to be vitamin e sometimes you have to add some iodine
and that should handle it but we're really doing with an imbalance of
low progesterone extremely low progesterone and low estrogen but the ratios are off okay a stuffy
sinus congestion can keep you from sleeping because you're not going to be able to breathe
the first thing you need to do is avoid dairy any type of dairy products because that's going
to create mucus and it's going to stuff up your nose i also notice if when people drink
wine every night that can make their nose stuffy and i don't know if it's the alcohol directly
or the sulfites i'm not sure but typically there's something you're eating that could be causing
the sinuses to be stuffy if you have a year-round mucous congestion oregano and garlic seems to work
really good but again if you have sinus problems there's more data on this i put a link down below
to learn more about it excessive urination that's going to keep you up some people get up
10 times a night to urinate completely unnecessary and this can be fully handled if you lower your
insulin how do you do that healthy keto and intermittent fasting i put a link down below
but if you're new to my channel i'm telling you this is like a no-brainer it works nearly 100 of
the time um because anytime your blood sugars are high or you have insulin resistance water
follows sugar so you're going to urinate more frequently especially at night all right restless
leg syndrome okay this is a simple b1 deficiency it's typically occurring because you're consuming
too many carbs that's depleting your vitamin b1 the best source of b1 is nutritional yeast
and that will get rid of your restlessness in your legs now i used to have this so bad for
so many years i didn't know what it was i would actually have to get up literally pound my legs
or massage them or go for a run because i had all this energy trapped up i had no idea
it was the high carbs okay and the b1 deficiency now if you're over training or exercised too much
that can also cause the same thing a buildup of lactic acid or restlessness and b1
actually gets rid of lactic acid in the body but also omega-3 will help all right sleep apnea this
is a situation where you're getting a thickening of the passages in the back of the nasal area
and the solution would be to decrease insulin i've done videos on this just do healthy keto
and intermittent fasting and you will see a progressive improvement over time in your sleep
apnea okay high cortisol from stress that's going to keep you up you want to make sure that you
don't consume stimulants so cut down on the caffeine and the coffee the tea the chocolate
over doing that will definitely keep you up go for long walks physical work is very very therapeutic
around your yard whatever make sure you turn off the light and not have bright
lights right before you go to bed you want to slowly kind of get away from bright lights
emf or your electrical devices around your um your bed which a lot of times people sleep with their
cell phone right next to the bed not a good idea because emf electromagnetic fields can greatly
increase cortisol and there's a lot more actions to do but high cortisol will definitely keep
you up that was my problem for many years too there was nights i didn't even sleep one minute
and so i had to handle my the high cortisol and you can also do a saliva
test that measures your circadian rhythms with cortisol to find out if that's your problem
their home kits you can buy online but it's definitely a source of a lot of sleeping problems
okay let's say you can't fall asleep easily you're laying there for hours that was me too and
your body just will not go to sleep your body actually goes through four levels
of sleep from a light sleep to a deep sleep and they they go through like a 90 minute cycle
if you go to sleep too late let's say uh past 12 o'clock now you have to catch the wave so it might
be more difficult to go to sleep and you might have to wait like 90 minutes before you catch the
next wave so typically if you go to bed before 10 you're in good shape personally i go to bed
very early like 9 but i get up very early that's just what i i seem to like couple reasons why you
can't fall asleep you have a high pulse rate that could come from a lack of potassium because you
don't like vegetables or or you need potassium or your ph is too acidic because you are consuming um
too much sugar or you're consuming kombucha tea which will acidify you and and throw off your ph
caffeine from chocolate coffee tea too much of that will keep you up bloating because you're
you're not eating the right foods will keep you from falling asleep low potassium foods will keep
you from falling asleep in fact i've noticed when i don't consume enough vegetable like for example
seven cups or like a big salad and i skip that it's more difficult to go to sleep because i
just don't have the potassium so leafy greens important next point is to be able to relax i
created a video on an exercise just to totally relax your body through the day because so many
people are holding tension and they're they're stressed out there's a great thing you can do
i put the link down below you should practice this through the day when you're driving a car
totally relax your body when you're going through stress during the day
totally relax your body and that is going to help you sleep at night all right next thing is
restaurant foods i don't know if you've noticed this but the times that you go out to dinner
do you not sleep as well comment down below i'm curious i found that if i eat out my sleeping
isn't right and i think it's because of the the quality of food in restaurants
omega 6 fatty acids they'll use soy or corn oil not good it affects the liver
it affects the gallbladder so try to eat it at home as much as possible there you have it
a lot of the reasons why you can't sleep hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

hi guys in this video I want to talk about phosphorus there's not a lot of data out
there on phosphorus you may hear about calcium but phosphorus is just as important for making
your bones really really solid in fact 80% of phosphorus is located in the skeletal system
of your body so it's also involved in making blood DNA muscle energy helps you pH cellular
membranes called phospholipids so I mean that's like the membrane around the cell that allows
information to go back and forth and hormones and minerals and everything so phosphorus is
vitally important if you're low in phosphorus you're going to be tired phosphorus is the
accelerator of the nervous system it really gives that get-up-and-go creatine phosphate which is a
natural thing when people take creatine they they build up that creatine phosphate which gives them
more endurance when they're working out or muscle mass more recovery okay tarter so if you're low
in phosphorus you start building up calcium deposits whose calcium works with phosphorus
so you actually can make more tartar kidney stones spurring brittle bones and there's many
other ones okay and so you become low if you're diabetic insulin high insulin alcohol anti-acids
Crohn's when there's some type of digestive issue that you're not able to assimilate it low stomach
pH also high phosphorus will give you cavities like in soft drinks right all that phosphoric
acid can actually you know run out your teeth bone loss high blood pressure other than that
is totally fine right the foods that are high in phosphorus are pretty much all the fish cod tuna
scallops sardines pumpkin seeds nuts and crimini mushrooms okay these foods give the highest amount
of phosphorous all right thanks for watching I just want to take a moment to thank you for
your amazing amazing successes that you guys are writing about and I would love to have a complete
success story from you with a before picture and a nap your picture as well if you have that and
I put a link down below so you can fill it out if you don't have a weight loss before and after

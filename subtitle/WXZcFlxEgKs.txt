i'm going to talk about the 10 benefits of something called
l-arginine this is an amino acid l-arginine has the ability to release
through its bio chemical breakdown something called nitric oxide which is
very different than nitrous oxide which is laughing gas when you go to the
dentist nitric oxide and it only lasts a few
seconds but this right here has the ability to
relax your arteries the smooth muscle and the
arteries which is going to lower your blood pressure it's going to
lower stress it decreases free radicals so it's like
a very powerful antioxidant it decreases
ldl cholesterol oxidation it's an anticoagulant
it helps erectile dysfunction it helps your immune system it increases
blood flow through your brain as well as through the lung that's why
you breathe better it also helps relax sphincters which are smooth muscle
valves helping things like hemorrhoids for
example and it has the ability to increase growth hormone which is
anti-aging fat burning helps muscle strength
build muscle etc now if you think about it our heart works incredibly hard
contracting relaxing all day all night you don't have to think about it it's
all automatic every year your heart beats 39
million times i mean that's a tremendous amount of work that your heart has to
perform and so when your arteries relax you not only
take the stress off the arteries but you also
increase blood flow into the heart muscle itself preventing things like
angina what i would recommend taking if you were going to take this is
three grams two times a day you'd want to take that on an empty
stomach now there's something else that you may want to add to that
is either the consumption of beets or you can take beets in a powder
because beets are very high in nitrates and that can also activate nitric oxide
and beets are also high in boron which has other great benefits
now here are the cons of l-arginine if you have
herpes already in your body whether it's herpes simplex like a cold sore
or you have herpes zoster as in the virus behind shingles
if you take too much l-arginine that can reactivate
these viruses and bring them out so those are the cons so there's quite a
few benefits but there's some drawbacks as well

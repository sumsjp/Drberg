today we're going to talk about the most common cause of a liver transplant
and this thing i'm going to talk about is the number one cause of liver transplant in the u.s
and the second most common cause of a liver transplant in the world and that would be
acetaminophen commonly known as tylenol now if you're in europe it may be called paracetamol
now here's the problem the active ingredient in tylenol which is acetaminophen is in quite a few
over-the-counter medications it's in alka-seltzer plus benadryl excedrin it's in pacoset ribotusin
pseudofit theraflu vix nyquil and dequel and in vicodin and many of these medications come
in one gram tablets but here's the problem only four grams a day is an overdose you should never
take more than three grams in a 24 hour period because the toxicity from this chemical literally
destroys the liver cells and this destruction is irreversible now to make things worse if you
have a fatty liver if you have cirrhosis if you have hepatitis if you're an alcoholic if you're
a heavy smoker and if you are on antidepressant medication or antibiotics or you drink a lot of
aspartame because you drink a lot of diet sodas all of this weakens the liver to the point where
three grams in a 24-hour period is highly toxic if not deadly so here's what happens the liver makes
two enzymes that are supposed to dismantle this chemical and turn it into a harmless
byproduct but what happens when you overload these two enzymes too much with this chemical
it gets saturated and then the third enzyme comes in to try to cope with this and then you
start depleting your glutathione which is a very important protective antioxidant for the liver
then you start getting necrosis of the hepatocyte or the liver cells
now the term necrosis is the death of body tissue so your liver cells hepatocytes basically die
i want to give you a little reality on how easy it is to overdose on this chemical
let's say you're taking nyquil and alka-seltzer plus and you're taking two of each twice a day
which doesn't seem to be that outrageous right well right there that equates to 4 450
milligrams of acetaminophen which is a toxic dose so basically by taking just these two medications
okay two doses twice a day you literally can cause liver failure all right so what can you do
if you accidentally take this amount number one activated charcoal take it within one hour okay
that will help to minimize the toxicity number two nac this is a natural remedy a very powerful
antioxidant for the liver then we have milk thistle which is a very powerful effective
herb that can help protect the liver cells as well and the third option is to get a liver transplant
the problem is there's a long waiting list for a new liver and who knows if you're going to get one
so the key is basically having the knowledge of this data so you can avoid accidentally
overdosing on tylenol all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video

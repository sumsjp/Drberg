now i've been in practice for a very long time three decades
and out of all the patients that came in fatigued i was the absolute worst i was exhausted so what
i'm going to tell you is based on experience from someone who has had severe fatigue problems for
a very long time it wasn't until i started going into my 30s that i started getting my
energy back so what i want to do is i want to focus on the foods so you may be tired because
you're not sleeping if you're not sleeping i put a video down below for that information
or if you're excessively stressed check that out but what i want to talk about is the diet
now if we take a look at foods to avoid to get energy versus foods to eat to get energy
you're going to be a thousand times more successful if you avoid certain things
than just by eating certain things so for example if you're eating foods that are supposed to boost
your energy yet at the same time you're eating foods that you should be avoiding you're not going
to get your energy back so the most important thing is to avoid number one sugar all sugars
brown sugar all sugars and carbs grains fruit that includes bread pasta cereal crackers potato
juice you must get your carbs down to below 30 grams if you're going to have any energy at all
also what kills energy is the frequent eating because you're constantly dependent on the next
meal but these carbs will tend to boost your energy for about a minute and then your energy
will come crashing down so as far as what to eat let's talk about protein so you can actually get
very tired if you eat too much protein you need a moderate amount of protein somewhere between three
to six ounces per meal maybe seven maybe eight ounces but not more than that because it's going
to stimulate insulin okay you want to make sure your meat is more fatty so if you're gonna do fish
salmon that would be important uh if you're gonna do beef make sure it's more of a fattier
beef because if you do lean protein that tends to spike insulin a little bit more
the other two minerals that are key to get your energy back is number one potassium
because potassium is involved in something called the sodium potassium pump and you have
billions of these pumps in all the cells and they generate the electrical battery for all the cells
they help your nerves to function your muscles to function and the requirement for potassium
is very high we need like 4700 milligrams so i'm going to recommend you your potassium from
salad or vegetables magnesium is also in salad and vegetables so you can kill two birds with
one stone but magnesium is involved in making energy it's in the mitochondria in order to make
atp which is the energy currency of the body you need magnesium so those are the two most important
minerals to get your energy back b vitamins are also crucial and you don't necessarily have to
take b vitamins if you're not consuming refined grains because refined grains deplete you of b
vitamins but i do recommend nutritional yeast on a regular basis to get your b vitamins to
give you energy you need the b vitamins in many different metabolic pathways in the energy factory
called the mitochondria as far as the fats go i think mct oil will be very very beneficial
not just for brain energy but if you're going to exercise to give yourself more endurance mct oil
turns into ketones pretty fast the best fats are not vegetable fats animal fats okay for energy
eggs are one of the most balanced foods they have pretty much every vitamin out there and they're a
healthy balance of fat and protein and of course you can add some fatty nuts in there too like
pecans that would be very beneficial i promise you if you just get these basic things in there
you are going to get your energy back if you try to search on the internet on ways to get energy
it is so filled with the wrong information the wrong foods i would ignore that just do this
and you will see it will work hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

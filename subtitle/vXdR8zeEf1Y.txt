now to a lot of people what i'm going to say is new information we are so used to hearing
that salt's bad for the heart it's going to cause a heart attack it's going to cause stroke
so make sure you don't overdo it on your salt well that is absolutely positively not true a very
credible large study called the peer study stirred up a lot of controversy there's over 137 000
people involved in 18 countries 667 communities so it was a very broad population all over the place
and this is what they found if you're consuming less than three grams of sodium per day you
could be at risk for getting a heart attack and a stroke now take a look at this graph that i have
right here the world health organizations and and many other organizations have been recommending
to keep your salt in the low range between 2.0 and 2.4 grams that's one teaspoon per day well just
what happens that falls within the risk factor of getting a heart attack that is considered low
sodium and based on this study which i'm going to put a link down below the optimum range of sodium
is between four and five grams that's four to five teaspoons of salt apparently you have the least
amount of heart attacks compared to either too low or even too high and they also incidentally found
that potassium is very protective on the heart the more potassium you have the less heart attacks you
have and i've been saying that for a long time potassium is very very important especially for
blood pressure even your kidneys i mean the only contraindications i'm sure there's a few others
for potassium is if you're stage five kidney failure in that condition of course you don't
want to consume that much potassium but for most people potassium is protective on the kidney heart
and definitely will help your blood pressure now the question is why well when you actually lower
your sodium you increase a hormone called aldosterone that's from your adrenals and
if aldosterone's too high you can have a lot of problems especially with blood pressure
especially damage to the heart there's even a class of high blood pressure medication
that inhibits aldosterone okay why because they found that the higher the aldosterone the higher
the blood pressure so in summary don't be afraid of salt especially if it's sea salt i recommend a
very good quality sea salt himalayan sea salt is a really good one but there's many others
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

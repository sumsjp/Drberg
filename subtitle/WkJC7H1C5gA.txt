hey guys dr. Berg here now last time I talked about foods that help you sleep today I'm going
to talk about the foods that prevent sleep being all right number one snacking now what is snacking
do well every time you eat regardless of what you eat you trigger insulin and this whole idea of six
small meals a day is a nut is not good because every you're actually jacking up that insulin
all the time you're going to develop insulin resistance that's a pre-diabetic situation now
the problem with that is it gives you frequent urination at night preventing sleeping so we
don't want that secondly it will give you sleep apnea eventually it swells the back of the final
sinus passages back there and we don't want that so insulin resistance is something that we can
actually correct if we don't snack too frequent next one is sugar well of course this relates to
the insulin resistance because every time you need sugar not only will it trigger insulin and create
the same situation but it's going to create a depletion of potassium the normal relaxer
I mean there's times in my past where I ate so much sugar that I was up all night long because
my heart was just pounding because I didn't have the potassium so sugar is a no now when you try
and sleep okay now three is protein protein is a stimulant protein will is high in phosphorus
it'll wake you up especially too much protein now I'm not against protein you need to do some
protein a moderate amount but try not to go too much especially late at night because you're
not going to be able to sleep especially if we actually have a lot of protein and no vegetables
that would be bad okay coffee and tea well the caffeine right caffeine is a stimulant now here's
the thing I'm not a post for you doing like a small thing of coffee if there's no sugar but
if you do like several that's not good if you're doing tea all day long that's not good because
that caffeine takes a while for your liver to detoxify it and that will keep you up at night
okay alcohol alcohol will just dehydrate you it also messes with your liver it will keep you
up it is with a growth hormone which is how that helps you sleep so it does a lot to your hormones
and it's definitely going to prevent you from going to sleep next one is a protein plus sugar
so if you combine like lobster with a dessert or hamburger with a fry so our hamburger with
the bun you're going to raise insulin and that's going to again create that insulin resistance and
keep you up because you're peeing all night and you're going to probably feel bloated
you're going to gain weight in the midsection which also is going to prevent because there's
if you have so much fat in your midsection the space in there is going to be compressed
up into your lungs especially if you're trying to sleep so that can actually prevent you from
getting a comfortable sleep - because that belly is always in the way the other thing
too is the drinking excessive amounts of water so you want to drink when you're thirsty don't
drink too much and and as far as being hydrated hydrated goes if you drink outside a vinegar or
lemon with your water that's more hydrating just water alone but just don't over drink alright go

now i'm always trying to understand why things occur in the body and so this is an interesting
topic why stress can potentially grow your hair now we know that stress does that but
why right i always want to know why i found out and i want to share this reason with you now
of course you have the normal aging process that causes grayness you have genetic factors but there
are also epigenetic factors which are above your genes so you're not defined by your genes you can
always do something about it with your nutrition your diet your environment etc but what i want to
talk about is premature graying because you're going through too much stress first let's talk about
what is the mechanism okay well here's what happens in the hair follicle you have these little
cells called stem cells which creates the pigment okay so you're looking at brown hair right here
that is created from melanocytes which is created from stem cells which are actually
directly contacting the hair root now when researchers tried to figure this out
they first looked into the possibility of it being an autoimmune disease with
some type of inflammatory thing and that wasn't the case then they thought it probably was high
levels of cortisol but they actually removed the adrenal glands and exposed the subject to stress
and there was still a graying action and then they found this when a hair root is exposed to
chronic stress you get an elevation of something called noradrenaline noradrenaline is like the
precursor to adrenaline it's responding from the flight or fight mechanism and they found it was a
neurotransmitter nor adrenaline that causes these stem cells to migrate away from the hair root
into the skin so you lose your stem cells now you lose your melanocytes and you lose your ability
to keep your hair pigmented now the question is what can you do about it well you want to keep
your stress low that is the key you want to sleep more you want to exercise more you want to take
b1 on a regular basis i recommend getting it from nutritional yeast and really just identify what is
the cause of the stress what is stressing you out and do something about it all right there
you have it why stress can grow your hair hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

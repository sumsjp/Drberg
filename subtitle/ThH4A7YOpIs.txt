now you would think if you went through surgery and had anesthesia
that that numbing effect would keep your stress and cortisol levels low
because your body wouldn't be able to feel
the pain or injury but that's not the case when you go through surgery
you might not feel it but your body is definitely going to
feel it and react to it there's all sorts of interesting research
on the post operative cognitive dysfunction
that occurs after surgery now there's a lot of
post-operation symptoms in general or side effects that can occur that
have nothing to do with cognitive but we'll talk about that
what you need to know is that this effect correlates with
the severity of your surgery i had two major surgeries both were from
a broken arm i fractured my shoulder and i fractured
my elbow in another accident and that was actually a major
surgery i think it was like three hours they had to put together my elbow with
30 different pieces of screws and things like that
and you can come out of it like you've been traumatized the second time
of course it was necessary but there are some things that you need to know about
and do to minimize the potential side effects
from getting a surgery now it really depends on how
invasive the surgery is but what happens when you go through
surgery you have to look at it like another
trauma a stress response you're activating
the adrenals not just the outside of the adrenal which is the
cortisol response but also the inside the adrenaline so you're gonna you're
gonna really raise your adrenaline and your sympathetic nervous system
and when you raise cortisol okay you can also lose your potassium and
this is why many times they will give you a
potassium iv through surgery to make sure that your
potassium doesn't drop down too far because it can affect the the heart also
when cortisol increases you get more gluconeogenesis so your body is
actually making more sugar it's just like making more sugar and
it's going to affect your blood sugars and
come down because then you spike insulin and then you get
sodium retention as well so there's various things that can happen after
surgery it can affect your memory your ability to learn your inflammation
levels they can go up your immune system when you increase
cortisol your immune system actually gets suppressed so
this could leave you open to developing even an autoimmune disease
if it's too much of a shock to the body there's some interesting data i'll put
it the link down below of people developing gilliam beret
syndrome after a surgery this is an autoimmune
disease when you have high cortisol you can also
increase the catabolic effect on your body when your body is breaking down
more protein than it should muscle hair skin joints
also there's some data on decreased wound healing after the surgery
your overall mood goes down like you might get depression or anxiety
and have electrolyte imbalances so what should you do if you know you're
going into surgery and you can prepare for it
i highly recommend that you do intermittent fasting
and then you fast the day before going in what is that going to do
that is going to automatically strengthen your adrenals it's going to
give you some stress resistance it'll increase
your ability to deal with oxidative stress
it will increase your ability to make antioxidants
and your recovery time as well so you go through surgery
and then you do some fasting after the surgery too that would be very very
beneficial and then when you eat make sure it's the
healthy version of keto because ketones in general are
anti-inflammatory and also your brain loves ketones
if given the choice the brain will always pick ketones
over glucose and that automatically will help your mood
so doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting
improves your cognitive function as well as your mood
as well as dropping inflammation and improving the immune system you can
even stimulate stem cells if you do periodic prolonged
fasting and lastly if you're going into a
surgery i would make sure that you take a good amount of electrolytes maybe
a few weeks or a week before you go through surgery
and after you go through surgery because of the stress response depleting
potassium you want to keep that potassium in there
as well as other minerals so the point about this video is just to increase
your awareness of the connection between surgery and
stress and being aware that surgery is a major
major stress that can contribute to things
so you can now prepare for a surgery if you happen to have one coming up and
minimize the damage control and not to mention what they feed you at
the hospital after the surgery if you have to be in
in a hospital for a period of time it's going to be refined carbohydrates
so i would do whatever i could to bring my own food or do fasting
and not consume that hospital food thanks for watching before you go
if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

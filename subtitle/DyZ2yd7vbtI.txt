there are many so-called health foods out there for kids that are total junk
in fact they'll create a lots of problems and so sometimes I'll have a
parent parent that will say well you know my kids are skinny so it's okay
that they eat the junk or my husband he's thin so he said he can eat anything
you want right so I'm going to talk about all the other problems that occur
in addition to being overweight when eating junk food
so let's actually do that in the white board over here let's go inside so let's
talk about the absolute worst so-called health foods for kids right so number
one the biggest one would be juice parents think that juice is healthy for
kids fruit juice right so they do the juice ease they do the orange juice
grapefruit juice and they sent it home with their lunch thinking that has some
kind of vitamins that is just pure sugar that is going to raise the sugar so high
in their bloodstream because it's even worse than taking a coke that or
soda they're going to basically get all the sugar and the setting up for a
hypoglycemia low blood sugar than a high sugar down the road it's just going to
mess up the pancreas and it's going to deplete a lot of nutrition in the body
and it's going probably give a lot of dental problems too so if you plan on
going to the dentist and giving you know a lot of cavity replacements then just
keep feeding the kid juice I even see little babies drinking juice bad idea
okay so now you might say well what about orange juice what about vitamin C
there is no vitamin C and orange juice none whatsoever why because when you
heat all these juices are pasteurized that means they're heated and it kills
everything in it including all the vitamin C the only vitamin C no orange
juice is the stuff they add later but it's synthetic it's not even the real
thing so you're just drinking sugar water and you're going to just create
problems with with more sugar with the kids you know hyper irritability ADD all
these other issues so if you just cut that out that would be wonderful and you
can have them do other things like I like the
like the carbonated water and the flavored stevia they have flavored coke
root beer lemon fruit berry you can take ten drops of liquid stevia put it in
some carbonated water and they think they're drinking a soda there's no sugar
in it it's great I give it to my kids all the time
my big kids they're like 21 22 and 19 so so that's important to avoid juice okay
so that's number one okay now number two flavored yogurt first of all plain
yogurt has 10 grams of sugar flavored yogurt has about 38 grams of sugar per
serving size if you get one of those tubs it's like what is it four serving
sizes so we've got 38 times four there is so much hidden sugar in yogurt it's
crazy so the the go gogurt or whatever you call it and the different things
that parents put in their lunches that's just pure sugar
now even the vanilla has 38 grams of sugar so again that's hidden sugar we
want to get the sugar out your chill your children are going to be less
irritable hyperactive if you do that it's going to make your life a lot
better okay so that is number two let's go to three weight gain shakes so your
child needs to gain weight right so you give your child ensure or maybe Peter
sure or some type of drink which is loaded with vitamins and calories to
gain weight well let me tell you something first of all it's tons of
sugar the first ingredient is like sugar okay so we got hidden sugars and it's
all synthetic vitamins so you're really not getting the real deal if you want
your child to gain weight the best food to give your child is potatoes red
potatoes yams sweet potatoes starches instead of anything any refined sugars
okay so avoid the weight gain shakes because they're not going to actually
gain weight in a healthy way okay number four whole-grain cereal well first of
all most of that whole-grain is made from flour that's been sitting in the
shelf for about six months and when you grind the grain
you lose a lot of nutrition right away and anything that is refined grain like
breads pastas cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes those foods for
children should only be consumed in my very small amounts not in large amounts
like you see with the pasta dinners and all that you're just basically creating
a situation where the child is raising their insulin and they're going to
create be speed on the road a lot of problems of sugar and it's not the best
food so in place of that you do proteins proteins are fine a lot of vegetables
that maybe they'd like you have to find something fruits are totally ok with
your kids nuts seeds for kids there's even a great book that I have that you
can get recipes for your child and these are this is like the brownie and the
cookies and the English muffins and the bread that you can make without the
sugar or the flour pancakes peanut butter cups cookies even ice cream so
this might be something that you want to get some ideas or recipes for your
children so they could so they're not like feeling deprived because I know
when they go to their friend's house they're probably eating all this junk or
at school but you want to set the standard at least at home to start
eating healthy and give them alternatives my kids do not know the
difference between the junk and this right here this is healthy junk they
don't know the difference I don't I don't even perceive the difference
actually this is better because it doesn't leave that aftertaste in your
mouth so again kids got to watch out what you
give them don't give them the gummy bear vitamins those are not real vitamins
give them a food based vitamin but these are the most common so-called health
foods that people say oh it's healthy but it's really not healthy
ok so apply this information and I will see you in the next video

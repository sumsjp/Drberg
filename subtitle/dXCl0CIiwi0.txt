so let's talk about the 10 benefits of sheep cheese now the study that this video was based on
comparing the milk quality of sheep versus goat versus a cow and the winner hands down is sheep
now the benefit of consuming the cheese from the milk is that the bacteria that helps make
the cheese eats up most of the lactose the milk sugar so we have low sugar in the cheese
we have high quality protein and high quality fat and a lot of nutrition let's take a look
first of all sheep cheese is way easier to digest compared to goats or cow cheese okay number two
if we compare especially with goat's cheese which is very very strong sheep cheese is a has a very
light taste it doesn't have that real strong taste number three it has higher amounts of protein
a higher amounts of concentrated whey number four it's the best tolerated if we look at allergies
number five it has a higher calcium to zinc ratio number six it has the perfect calcium
the phosphorus ratio number seven it has high levels of vitamin a vitamin d and vitamin e
number eight it has higher amounts of folic acid and b12 and number nine it has twice
the amounts of butter fat and 10 it has higher amounts of mct fat and small chain fatty acids
so if you're out evaluating cheeses and you have a choice always go with the sheep cheese

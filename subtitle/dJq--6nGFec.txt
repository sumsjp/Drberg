so I think that most people consider a vitamin deficiency coming from a lack of
eating certain things in your diet right and you may know that consuming pure
sugar or refined sugar will cause a vitamin deficiency and of course all the
refined grains and caffeine and if you have a lack of bile let's say you don't
have a gall bladder or you have a problem with your liver you can't make
bile you're going to be deficient in vitamin
A D and K those are fat soluble vitamins and then if you don't have enough
microbiome your friendly bacteria you'll also have vitamin deficiencies and if
you don't have enough stomach acid you're not going to be able to absorb
the minerals into your body because you need a very strong acid stomach to
absorb minerals and then there's the anti nutrients it's like phytates which
block zinc and tannins which block the B vitamins and then you have ox let's like
and spinach and rhubarb and almonds which will block calcium the calcium
instead gets stuck in your kidney so there's a lot of data on these things
but did you realize that stress will also cause vitamin deficiencies
not to mention all sorts of other health problems and especially a lowered immune
system so let's let's talk about that so right here we have the Ciba collection
of medical illustrations volume four endocrine system and I'm gonna flip to
the page about cortisol so when we're talking about stress in the body we're
really talking about the hormone cortisol cortisol goes up and it creates
a whole series of effects so in this page it talks about several nutrients
becoming lost when you have high levels of chronic output of cortisol but
vitamin b1 deficiency it usually comes from consuming too much refined sugar
but it also comes from having high levels of stress over a period of time
and this is probably one of the reasons when you take b1 you just feel like such
a relief of stress so if you want a nice calm sensation nutritional yeast or
take a natural b1 not the synthetic version and you're gonna feel very
stress free also vitamin D stress causes the receptor for vitamin D to be
downgraded so that means you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin D
efficiently and we're talking about vitamin D deficiencies couple symptoms are anxiety
depression lack of good restorative sleep so vitamin D is very very
important and then we have a zinc deficiency and zinc has a lot to do with
neurotransmitters and stabilizing your mood and then we have a potassium
deficiency which is right on this page people will attempt to lose potassium
when they go through stress and initially they retain sodium so they
have fluid retention so we have low potassium and high sodium so that could
potentially increase your blood pressure cause fluid retention but potassium is
very important in stabilizing your pulse rate for example if your potassium is
low your pulse rate will go up your blood pressure will go up your arteries
will become stiffened so potassium is like a physiological tranquilizer it's
calming it's really good for sleep and this is why I recommend a lot of
potassium because our body's really need 4,700 very few people get this much but
it's very interesting when a person starts to get this amount from
increasing their vegetables or taking it as the electrolyte they start having
more energy and they start sleeping better and they just feel a lot more
calm and then as stress goes on and your dream will start becoming burnt out then
you start to lose sodium so when your stress is really high this could be one
of the reasons why people crave a lot of salty foods when they're stressed
alright so if you haven't seen my video on the stress webinar you should
probably check that out I put it right here

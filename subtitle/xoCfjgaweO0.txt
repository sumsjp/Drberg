you know i promote turmeric a lot
because it's one of the most
amazing
herbs for inflammation
and many other things
but i always have people that comment
you know you don't want to heat it
because it's going to destroy the
phytonutrients so i just want to let you
know that is a complete myth you would
think
heat will destroy all compounds but in
the case with certain herbal remedies
apparently it seems to enhance certain
phytonutrients which is quite ironic
because heat destroys enzymes now just
as a quick side note
i had the idea that heat destroyed
things and that's why one time i
promoted a video talking about
sardines and
when they can sardines they destroy the
omega
3 and i just
assume that of course i never tested it
and i put this video out
and then i felt a little weird about
putting the video out when i personally
never tested the omega-3 from canned
tuna or sardines
so i actually sent it to the lab to test
it cost me like four grand but i found
out there were a good amount of omega-3
fatty acids in both sardines and canned
tuna so i redid the video and put that
data out and i was actually quite
surprised because i know they used high
heats so apparently when you cook things
it might destroy certain things but not
other things but this video is on
turmeric because it's such a powerful
and popular compound now this is based
on a couple studies which i'm going to
put the link down below where they
measure the total antioxidant capacity
so people use tremerican
drinks
supplements
and
in their teas in their food and a lot of
times they heat it so in this study that
this video is about
they tested roasting boiling and cooking
at temperatures of 180 degrees celsius
which is
356 degrees fahrenheit that's very hot
and
for 70 minutes and they found certain
compounds and i'm going to talk about
three three very powerful antioxidants
survived in fact were enhanced
with this heat so apparently there's a
name for it's called thermal degradation
so apparently it enhances the
concentration and it increases the
solubility of certain phytonutrients so
the first one is for ulic acid so this
is an antioxidant
it's great for your skin to protect the
skin it's good to also counter sun
damage that phytonutrient was enhanced
the next one is called four vinyl
guaiacol
and this compound enhances something
called
nrf2 which does two things it decreases
cellular stress
and it increases the antioxidant defense
mechanism in your body so it's going to
help your immune system it's going to
help inflammation and the last one is
called the linen which is
the compound in vanilla and this is a
very powerful antioxidant it's an
anti-inflammatory and it's also
anti-microbial
it's used even as a preservative so
anyway the next time you cook or use
turmeric in your foods
don't be too concerned about cooking it
because there will be some positive
benefits in these compounds

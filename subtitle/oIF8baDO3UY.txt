hey guys dr. Berg here listen we're going to talk about egg yolks versus egg whites today
okay the first thing I want to talk about is a misconception that the egg white is healthier
than the egg yolk take a look at this nutritional profile protein you realize that the egg yolk has
I mean almost as much protein as the light it has 2.7 grams versus 3.6 grams I mean that's
amazing you would think it's just all fat and cholesterol no it's protein calcium 20
20 times I'm sorry ten times more calcium than the egg whites 21.9 milligrams versus two point
three milligrams for the white the government phosphorus sixty six point three versus five
milligrams potassium well look at the whites are a little more potassium zinc it has more zinc it
has more selenium more be one more folate that's the B vitamin it has a heck of a lot more 812 and
basically it has all the fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D and K 1 and K 2 okay so those are
those are things that people need and also DHA with it which is a healthy fat that your brain
needs which will improve memory and things like that so hands down you know shoot the egg white
away and just consume the yolk now this king egg yolk is way more nutritious than egg whites okay
it also has tons of what's called phospholipids those are basically things that are surrounding
the cellular membranes it's actually your brain needs to function so it's really good for cell
and brain health vitamin k2 I mentioned that before what is vitamin k2 well the chicken
eats the grass hopefully or even the cow eats the grass if you're talking about milk and what
happens if we convert K 1 to K 2 vitamin K 2 is very different than vitamin k1 vitamin k1
has to do with clotting factors vitamin k2 is a vitamin that will remove calcium from the wrong
place it will extract calcification from the arteries it takes out calcium from the joints
so it D calcifies the arteries so it's great for lowering blood pressure it's great for making
the arteries elastic and also it makes your bones really really strong and hard so we need vitamin
k2 vitamin k2 is a fat soluble vitamin and it's in goose liver it's in butter it's in fatty or
things that are grass-fed it's also a you can get it in a Dell if you it's like a fermented soybean
but it's pretty nasty tasting and you can get in the supplement but vitamin k2 is actually an egg
yolks if it's grass-fed now let's talk about choline where's choline it's a B vitamin that
helps pull fat out of the liver it's a little traffic B vitamins that will help your liver
and also help the brain and it's a precursor to what's called neurotransmitters which are like
hormone like beings within the nervous system but the egg is loaded with choline let's talk
about biotin biotin is intimately involved with proteins especially your hair nails so if you
consume like egg whites raw for example there's a protein in there that will block the absorption
of biotin and create a biotin deficiency and you may lose your hair if you consume a lot of
raw egg whites so we want to cook the egg whites and keep the egg yolks fairly raw okay but yeah
biotin is very very important here also there's a concern about cholesterol people think that
it's going to worsen their cholesterol it's not not to mention that there's the choline and also
lecithin in eggs which actually are the antidote to cholesterol here's the fact your body makes a
lot of cholesterol 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every single day that's equivalent to 14 eggs 333
strips of bacon or a pound of butter that's how much cholesterol that our body makes so if you're
concerned about getting high cluster with eggs you don't have to be concerned the only thing
that will increase when you consume eggs is the good cholesterol if you consume more cholesterol
your body will just make more okay unless there's a genetic effect that you have which is very rare
by the way and if that's the case then maybe you consume something like a red red yeast
rice okay as an extract that will help you lower cholesterol naturally form now the other point I
would make about eggs is that when you buy eggs it says free-range natural like chickens that
are roaming all that is just like it doesn't mean anything you want to get pasture-raised okay not
pasteurized pasture-raised that means that these chickens actually go into the pasture and the
grass and they consume the grass and the bugs and things like that and we want organic both of those
okay it has to be pasture raised in organic why because the feed that they feed chickens mainly
is soy and corn and I mean it'd be nice that they just consume grass but the problem if they use
corn and soy at least make sure that's organic because if not it's GMO and you're consuming
pesticides and you're consuming a lot of other issues so unfortunately most all the feed for
chickens and other animals are corn and soy but if it's organic it's at least it's not GMO okay
so go ahead and start consuming eggs there's not a problem I consume four eggs every single morning
and I'm still alive so I'm sure it's going to be fine for you too thanks for watching

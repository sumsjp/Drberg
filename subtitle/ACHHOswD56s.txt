so today we're going to talk about strep throat and some alternative things that
you can do a couple things you need to know about strep throat most the time
it's going to be viral related which means the antibiotics are not going to
work only 20% of the time it's bacterial now the confusing thing about strep
throat is that people assume that it's bacterial in nature when most the time
it's viral from an adenovirus or even epstein-barr virus so what I'm going to
show you is what to do if you have a sore throat whether it's coming from a
bacteria or a virus what's interesting about this infection is that it occurs
way more often from December to April so the most likely possibility is that it's
a vitamin D deficiency because there's less Sun and the vitamin D deficiency
makes you susceptible to both bacterial infections and especially viral
infections so there's a couple things I would recommend during these months
especially if you get these repeated infections a year after year or your
kids get it have them or yourself start taking vitamin D on a regular basis
during these months right here the other thing to do especially if it's a virus
which is the majority of time is vitamin C in higher amounts
make sure the vitamin C you're taking is non-gmo because a lot of times they make
it from corn okay and corn is GML so you want non-gmo take a large amounts that
really helps to put this virus back on our mission it can also help the immune
system to combat a bacterial infection as well the big problem that people are
running into with the antibiotics is that you start developing antibiotic
resistance and all of a sudden you get to a point where it doesn't work anymore
so people are looking for an alternative solution another remedy would be apple
cider vinegar why does that work because when you acidify the body and of course
you're going to dilute it with water okay one tablespoon in a glass of water
so when you consume this it actually stimulates the immune cells called the
phagocytes to work harder to combat this infection okay so this is one thing you
can do the other big thing is fasting okay when you fast for a period of at
least 18 hours you go through autophagy
and autophagy is a you know the self-cleaning of an effect it actually
helps clean up old damaged proteins but it also can help clear out viruses and
bacteria in fungus and mold from the body so this is a very very potent thing
and the last but most powerful thing I'm going to recommend is an acupressure
technique to help decrease the intensity of the pain in your throat okay so what
you do is you can either get a device to do this technique or get someone else to
do this on you what you're going to be doing is simply isolate the location of
where it hurts okay in your neck and you draw a circle in the back part of your
neck and you're gonna be applying pressure to the opposing opposite side
of where your intense soreness is located okay so there's two ways you can
do this you can get someone to apply pressure by pressing their thumb and
their middle finger to the back part of your neck equal pressure opposing the
pain for about one to two minutes okay in the demonstration I'm showing you
right now and if you do this the way that you know you have the exact right
spot is you're gonna find that it's going to be very sore in other words if
someone's pressing in the back of your neck and it's not extremely sore then
they have the wrong points so have them make the adjustments so they can find
the epicenter of this soreness which actually is the mirror image of where
you feel the sore throat and have them hold that pressure for two to three
minutes the other way you can do this is to get a massage device like the one I
have right here and this way you can lean back in a tall back chair or a
couch and apply this tool to the back of your neck to simulate someone's hand
pressure in fact this is one of the reasons why I created this tool is to be
able to do these techniques on myself and not to be dependent on someone else
doing them so in summary most the time it's going
to be viral in nature sometimes bacteria the vitamin C will actually stimulate
the immune system make sure it's non-gmo vitamin D is a great preventative and
something that can bolster your immune system apple cider vinegar can actually
speed up those little immune cells called phagocytes that can help
fight this thing off faster start doing fasting on immediate basis this is
probably the reason why people lose their appetite but I put a link down
below of how to do this correctly and the acupressure technique I put some
more videos down below to kind of get more information on how to do it that
can really take away the pain all right guys go ahead and try this and put your

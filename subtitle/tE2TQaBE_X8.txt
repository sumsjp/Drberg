so i wanted to create this video to really emphasize this one point
that does come up quite often and it has to do with
what puts you into ketosis some people think
that it's taking more fat they think oh my gosh i'm not in ketosis do i need to
consume more fat no you don't to get into ketosis you
need to lower your carbohydrates this is
the key right here lower your carbohydrates why
because that affects insulin when you eat carbs you
turn on more insulin and that blocks ketosis when you turn it off and you
lower your carbs lower amounts of insulin you go into
ketosis ketosis is all about
lowering your carbohydrates and to get yourself into ketosis it's not about
consuming more protein it's not a high protein diet
it's a moderate amount of protein you don't want to go
lean though you don't want to do lean proteins why
because the leaner the protein especially whey protein which actually
has like hardly no fat at all you're going to spike insulin
more so you have carbohydrates that trigger
insulin but lean protein will also trigger insulin
so on the insulin scale the very very top
and the insulin scale has to do with non-carbohydrate
foods that trigger insulin you have the glycemic index which is
how a carbohydrate influences blood sugars
and then you have the insulin index which are the non-carbohydrate
influences of insulin and the leaner the protein the more low-fat protein the
higher the insulin spike and when we talk about fat fat really
has a almost a neutral effect on insulin now
the fact that you're consuming fat and has some calories can raise
insulin a little bit but it has the least effect over insulin
and not to over emphasize this point enough
to get into ketosis you just need to keep your insulin low
by keeping your carbs low and not do lean protein
you want to make sure you consume the protein with with the fat that it
normally comes with why do we need dietary fat when you're
in ketosis a couple reasons number one you're going
to be able to fast longer especially in the beginning when
you get into ketosis and you're trying to do intermittent
fasting it's very very important to go longer and longer and longer if
you're doing a lower amount of fat you're going to be hungry you're not
going to be satisfied and it's going to be very difficult to go longer periods
of time so a real key thing is just to beef up your
fat at the meal to go to fast longer
and the longer you fast the more you get into ketosis the easier it's going to be
also there's a lot of nutrients in fat you have omega-3 fatty acids
you have all the fat-soluble vitamins you have other essential fats that your body
needs also fat is necessary to stimulate bile
production the cholesterol and fat that you eat are
necessary to also build all your cell membranes
your brain tissue your nerve tissue a lot of your body is made out of fat
so you need fat a good amount of your hormones are actually made out of fat
especially the sex hormones also fat helps to
slow the absorption of the protein you eat
there's a lot of people that do keto in intermittent fasting that don't need to
lose weight like myself and by consuming more fat
it's a way to maintain your weight because
if you start doing low carb moderate protein and low fat
you're going to lose more weight so it's a good way to
maintain your weight because your body is going to use the dietary
fat calories for ketones and not your own
fat to convert into ketones all right there you have

hey guys I'm gonna give you five tricks to make intermittent fasting work faster
okay okay number one potassium potassium is the most important mineral to fix a
problem with insulin which is behind weight in memory issues and
cardiovascular and so many other issues so the reason why people do intermittent
fasting is to fix those things but if you fix insulin you will speed things up
and you can't do it unless you have a sufficient amount of potassium our
normal amounts that we need per day is forty seven hundred milligrams that's a
lot so unless you're doing large salads or enhance your diet with potassium you
may not hit even your minimum requirements so potassium is a real
secret mineral to actually speed up things okay now number two over eating
so a lot of people when they're doing intermittent fasting they're doing like
two meals a day right and then what happens is they gorge themselves so much
they stuff themselves because they they have this idea that oh my gosh I'm not
going to be able to eat I'm only gonna eat one more it's kind of like a
survival mode when in fact you have a window if you want to get to like an
eight hour window or even a four hour window what you can do that's your
eating window it'd be much more important to let's say you ate in a four
hour window let's say you ate at twelve and then at four okay so you and you
just can't seem to get enough of those that food in there to keep your calories
high enough right so what you do is this is what I do
sometimes I'll have right in the middle of between twelve and four like at 2:00
I'll consume most of my salad and greens so that way I have time to digest it
until I eat another meal you're not going to spike insulin too
much with the with a salad compared to other things by the way but I'll have my
huge salad right in the middle of two meals that way I kind of spread it out
but it's still within the four hour window alright but just don't over eat
especially too many fats because it's gonna you're gonna feel too stuffed but
in the beginning as you're transitioning over you do need to add a little bit
more fat until you fully adapted to the point where you can switch to your own
body fat and be more sustained than consume fat to be sustained between
the meals okay number three do it gradually do not go into intermittent
fasting too fast if you have a blood sugar issue hypoglycemia you're gonna
crash and burn you're gonna it's going to be really difficult on your body
so I recommend start with three meals a day no snacks okay do that until you're
fully comfortable then two meals a day until you're fully comfortable and then
what will happen you can squish those two meals in within a four hour period
of time so let's say you get up and you eat at ten o'clock in the morning and
then you eat at like say six and then what you'll do over time when you get
comfortable then you eat at five and then you'll start at night and then in
the morning you'll school you'll switch it to eleven o'clock in the morning and
then eventually twelve and then push it down to four so you can start to
decrease the time the window of eating and increase enhance the fasting time
but you have to do it at your own pace do it to your comfortable until your
body says okay I can push a little bit longer versus trying to force it on your
body because as soon as it doesn't work you're going to give up and you're going
to have blood sugar issues when you're having blood sugar issues you're you're
adding more stress more cortisol more insulin number for extra sleep you ever
notice when you're stressed and tired you tend to be more hungry cortisol
increases by 50% if you're not sleeping and that's gonna raise insulin and knock
you out of fat burning so you want to get extra sleep if you have to take a
nap that's fine but you want to make sure you get at least seven to eight
hours of sleep okay also keep your stress as low as
possible go for long walks very very important to help you sleep last one is
high intensity interval training this is one of those workouts where you're
working out like a full body high-intensity high pulse rate short
duration lots of rest I'll put a video down there to explain that more but this
type of exercise if you add this to in a minute fasting you can really increase
growth hormone anti-aging fat burning everything but the key
make it high intensity short duration lots of rest so make it twice a week or
three times a week or even once a week making sure you have a lot of recovery
in between because this can make everything work even better just make
sure you do your workout just after your last meal or just before your last meal
or during your window of eating so that way you don't drop your blood Sugar's
too low if you do it on like completely no food in early mornings okay so those
are the five tweaks that to enhance the progress to make this go faster thanks
for watching hey guys a quick survey question I want to know what topic you
would like me to do a video on so each week I'm coming up with different types
of videos but I would rather have you tell me what you're interested in so I

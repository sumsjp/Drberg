hey guys listen I want to talk about asparagus this is an amazing vegetable it has a lot of
nutritional benefits let's just go through them number one it's a prebiotic what does that mean
a prebiotic it's a fiber that doesn't break down until you hit the large intestines and
the microbes down there basically live off this fiber and you build up your friendly bacteria
okay that's number one number two it's extremely high in vitamin K folate which is a B vitamin
b1 tons of b1 b2 3 5 and 6 so it has a lot of B vitamins and that's good for stress that's good
for energy and that's good just for you know calming your nervous system down and then it's
very very high in phosphorus so in the ancient times the Romans used to consume asparagus for
phosphorous to improve their energy so it's a real good way to improve your energy it's
diuretic so it actually gets rid of excess of fluid because it's a mild kidney detoxifier
now sometimes when you consume asparagus probably most times you have this bad smell that's sulfur
compounds being detoxified from the kidney so it's definitely good it's low in sodium high in
potassium so it's going to push fluid out kidney stones great for protecting you against kidney
stones and even dissolving kidney stones because this vegetable is really kidney supportive and
then it's high in chromium now chromium is the mineral that actually helps insulin resistance
so it makes insulin more sensitive to go through the cell and regulate glucose so it's great for
diabetics good for hypoglycemic people and definitely for insulin resistance so overall
I think it's a wonderful vegetable that you should consume on a regular basis so go ahead
and do it and I will see you in the next video hey guys thank you so much for watching I really

so today we're going to look at the seven early signs of kidney
disease there's actually five stages that the kidney
could potentially go through very mild to very
severe when you start to reach the level of
four or five you have to avoid certain things in your diet big time
like you have to avoid potassium phosphorous and there's quite a few
other ones but what's interesting is that potassium has a protective
effect on the kidney but when there's a certain point where it's gone too far
the body can't handle it and you want to avoid potassium
all right let's take a look at the seven early signs of kidney disease
the first one would be a metallic taste in your mouth
or you your breath smells like ammonia and because the kidney is a filter it's
like an oil filter things are backing up and it's coming
out of the breath it's coming out of the mouth you're tasting certain things that
you shouldn't taste number two you have protein aversion you
have a great dislike of protein especially meat
number three you're nauseous or you're vomiting number four difficulty
with concentration and number five you have
itchiness number six a loss of appetite number seven your face is swollen your
feet are swollen and even your hands have edema and their swelling because
the kidney has millions of tiny little filters okay the blood goes through and
then it actually recycles a lot of things
and it gets rid of the waste one of the best
indicators of kidney dysfunction whether it's one two three four five
would be to check the gfr it stands for glomerular
filtration rate this is a measurement of how well the kidney is acting as a
filter and one of the ways they look at this
value is they look at the creatine of the blood and creatine is a type of
protein also if you have protein in the urine or
you have high bun blood urea nitrogen and this is a
in a blood test and one of the biggest causes of kidney damage is
being a diabetic or pre-diabetic because the years of chronic consumption of
refined carbohydrates junk foods can all cause kidney
destruction if your glucose is on the high end
that's called glucose toxicity what happens is that that starts
damaging the tiny filtration units in the kidney
the blood vessels of the retina of the eye
destruction of the internal layer of the coronary artery on the heart
as well as the distal nerves which is the nerves at the very
end of the toes of the bottom of the feet or the hands
so you're getting destruction of the capillaries which is starving off
nutrients to the nerves but the kidney is definitely
one area that this high level of sugar destroys
so of course what i would recommend regardless of what stage the person is
at would be to get on a healthy keto plan
immediately of course if you're stage five you're gonna have to make some
adjustments with certain um nutrients like potassium and
phosphorus but the combination of intermittent fasting with healthy keto
with other things as well like this is a really really good
herb that has been shown to decrease creatine to improve the filtration rate
of the kidneys and i'll put a link down below to show some
incredible hardcore data on the benefits of
astragalus on the kidney it's extremely potent in
helping to reverse kidney damage all right thanks for

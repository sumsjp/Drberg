hi guys in this video I want to share
with you some interesting data on the
soy oil and salad dressings you don't
want to consume salad dressing with soy
oil number one it's going to be GMO most
most definitely because um you it's not
labeled in the US as GMO genetically
modified and 90% of all soy that is
produced in US is GMO so it has traces
of glyphosate which is an herbicide okay
so let's go ahead and go to the grocery
store and take a peek and I'll show you
exactly what I'm talking about so let's
try to find a dressing that doesn't have
soy here's one right
here
sugar
soy now I'm going to find a healthy one
let's try Annie's
Natural canola or soy but it's not
organic so it's GMO these are these this
company was bought out by not sure what
company but it was some other company
let's find honey
mustard canola which is also possibly
GMO uh Newman Zone used to actually not
have
soy soy or Canola okay
Helman soybean oil here they advertise
extra virgin olive oil but they have soy
in
it
Wishbone second ingredient water and soy
oil every
single
dressing soy oil oh wow
craft olive oil canola soybean even the
coconut the avocado oil mayo has soybean
but I bet you this one
brags wow we found one it doesn't have
soy oil it's actually olive
oil let me check this one right here
here soybean oil
Duke soybean it's all
soy and soy has been exposed to
glyphosate which is an herbicide so
that's the problem is we're trying to
find food that doesn't have these
chemicals good luck soybean oil here I
mean
Monsanto who basically sells the GMO
food they get subsidized by the
government for so you're getting
basically we're paying government's
paying which we're paying for the soy
and corn and then we buy the stuff back
we're like actually paying twice it's a
ripoff so it's really hard to find a
dressing that doesn't have soy you're
going to have to maybe go to a health
food store or hopefully you know they'll
have more expanded versions on the
brag all right sorry but we're just
going to have to look harder okay thanks

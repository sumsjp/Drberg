my name is Linda Fitzpatrick and I came
to Dr Burke for weight loss
initially it wasn't necessarily
um
a problem it was mostly it got to a
point where I knew my weight was
starting to affect my overall health so
and I was actually surfing on the
internet for weight loss doctors
programs and actually came across a a
survey that I actually took and it was
for Dr Berg
consultation with Dr Berg was actually I
guess that's what kind of sold me on on
the program itself was
speaking with him
um
overall yeah I think it was a it was a
good consultation Dr Berg actually spoke
of the various underlying issues
that I had basically from the shape of
the body I had an adrenal problem and
basically just the you talked about the
stimulus or the things that have impact
on my adrenal glands which you know
you're not not aware of at least I was
not aware of and then subsequently he
told me of all of the kind of like the
underlying issues that were as a result
of my adrenal problem one being was my
sleep
and the other one was that basically you
need to count you need to get healthy to
lose weight versus the other way around
and that kind of stuck with me
the most what got me was basically the
statement you need to get healthy to
lose weight because I thought you know
this is something that I want to do I
want to be healthy and if I can get
healthy and subsequently the weight will
come off then you know this is how I
want to attack this I mean I don't
necessarily want to kind of lose weight
to let's say to get healthy because you
know losing weight we tend to
you know do crazy things to kind of get
there but what he was saying hey you
don't necessarily need to do that you
need to get healthy and then all of the
other stuff will come so yeah that was
fairly convincing and like I said I
could have easily have been down the
street with another doctor but that by
by far was the most convincing or
revolution you know kind of a
revolutional statement kind of changed
my kind of thought of oh maybe I should
try looking at losing weight a little
bit different

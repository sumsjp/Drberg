so this video is for those people that are prone to kidney stones i want to
give you one more tip the most common type of kidney stone
would be a calcium oxalate stone and it just so happens that the foods
that are very high in oxalates are also high in other things that
protect you against the accumulation of oxalates and calcium
like fiber for example fiber reduces the excretion of calcium and oxalates
throughout the kidneys and also with these high fiber foods and we're talking
about spinach swiss chard beet tops rhubarb all really
high in oxalates they also are loaded with magnesium
potassium and phytates okay can by itself
decrease the risk of kidney stones so apparently we have things that are built
into these foods to help you but i'm not recommending
that you consume these but just high fiber foods in general
other vegetables that are loaded with fiber
magnesium potassium and even phytates and there's a lot of other benefits to
phytates which i'm not going to do in this video
but phytates tend to bind with calcium and other minerals
so sometimes people want to avoid those because they don't want to become
depleted with certain minerals but there's other benefits
to phytates it's a good chelator pulls out some heavy metals
also it's very anti-cancer but it's also good to help you reduce
the risk of kidney stones probably the most important
thing you can do if you're prone to kidney stones and i've talked about this
in other videos is to make sure your fluids are at least
2.5 liters every single day why because a kidney stone is a
condition where you're it's super saturated okay
and these calcium oxalate stones start to form but if you keep enough
fluid through the pipes it'll never get super
concentrated but i do recommend seven plus cups of
veggies every single day to make sure you have these four things
right here fiber in general decreases the urine
excretion of oxalates and calcium and
in a study below mentions that it can also decrease the risk of kidney stones
in post-menopausal women

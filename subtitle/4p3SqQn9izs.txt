now I have a question
would you buy this product if I added
maltodextrin to it chances are you
probably wouldn't okay I'm going to
teach you a scientific
simple quick test you can apply
to any food or supplement to determine
if there is hidden starches okay like
maltodextrin by simply adding a little
iodine
check this out all right I'm going to
show an experiment
this test is to determine if there are
carbohydrates in your supplements or
even your food okay and primarily I'm
going to focus on maltodextrin because
that's a hidden
carb which is really a sugar
in a lot of supplements especially in
flavors now it works like this all you
need is some iodine okay if you combine
iodine with a starch it turns the color
blue now if we take just normal water
okay I'm just going to take water
we just take a drop or two
of iodine in just regular water tap
water
okay
you can see it doesn't turn blue
stays kind of golden yellow okay
but if we take
some iodine on some wonderful bread you
can see
it will turn it blue okay that's the
chemical reaction
that occurs which I'm not going to get
into why but it just does that now if we
take pure maltodextrin for example
and put it in some water right here
okay mix it up
put a couple drops of
iodine in it
you can see
the color
blue or purple
okay that's pure maltodextrin
now let's take this other electrolyte
powder which is a competitor's brand
which has a very similar formula to mine
like a copycat formula
they state that this is without sugar or
maltodextrin okay cool
okay so let's add a scoop of that and a
couple drops of iodine
let's see if it has maltodextrin in
there
whoa
turns
purple blue
apparently it does
all right now let's take my electrolyte
powder let's see if it has any
maltodextrin in there or or carbs
starches I mean
okay
mix it here let's put a couple drops of
iodine in there
hmm
no purple no mocha dextrin
in fact let's put some even more iodine
in there
see if it eventually turns it purple
and the answer is no it stays yellow
gold
and you can try this with
anything okay so you just need some
iodine and you can add it to the the
food or put in some liquid if there's a
powder and you can detect hidden
maltodextrin and other starches in your
supplements and food is I went ahead and
did the iodine tests on every single one
of my products and I also learned
something new about this iodine test or
starch test and that is this iodine will
also react against chlorophyll and so if
a product has chlorophyll like a
wheatgrass juice powder or cruciferous
or a leafy green because of the pigment
chlorophyll in interacting with iodine
it will turn the substance a little bit
Brown not purple but Brown we also
learned that if a product has inulin
okay it can also alter the color so I
just wanted to bring that up because
it's not just maltodextrin or other
starches that can turn things different
color all right so now that you know how
to determine if there are hidden
starches in your your products that you
buy let's talk a little bit more about
these hidden starches and the main
starch that is put in so many of these
products is maltodextrin it's a nearly 4
billion dollar industry where are they
putting all this maltodextrin in well
they use it as a bulking agent a
thickening agent a carrier for various
things like
flavorings they use it to add certain
texture they use it to increase shelf
life they promote it as being
plant-based and something that's very
very inexpensive one metric ton of this
stuff is like only
520 dollars so if a manufacturing
company wants to use it to add something
as a filler maybe add some texture
they're only spending pennies okay so
the profit can go very very high there's
some other sneaky added benefits to a
company that you should know about
number one maltodextrin can be
classified on the label
as a carbohydrate but not as a sugar
despite behaving like a sugar I mean on
the glycemic index
you have table sugar
65.
glucose 100.
maltodextrin is between 105 and 185 I
mean when that stuff hits your
bloodstream you are majorly spiking your
blood sugars and majorly increasing
insulin and what's Wild is there's a
loophole that allows you to classify it
as a carbohydrate and not as a sugar in
fact and also when maltodextrin is 0.5
grams per serving size they don't have
to list maltodextrin on the label and
it's usually made from corn but it's
also made from wheat rice potato but
many of the supplements that you are
probably taking right now have it in
there as a hidden ingredient for various
reasons one as a kind of a carrier or a
conversion of liquid flavoring to
powdered flavoring in fact it was very
very difficult for me to find a
flavoring company that did not use
maltodextrin and unfortunately many of
these supplement companies out there are
developed and formulated by marketers
who don't really care about the quality
but you have flavorings you have
supplements you have energy gels
uh that are used for long distance
Runners that actually even have in the
label like sugar-free but it's just
filled with
hidden sugars as carbohydrates they're
even going after the baby formulas yeah
baby formula loaded with maltodextrin
and definitely uh the sport products uh
in muscle building powders
energy drinks Etc but unfortunately a
lot of people don't know about this it's
that little dirty secret that if people
found out they wouldn't buy a product
that has this very very high glycemic
index sugar in it if you're going to
exercise right and you're going to take
a sports drink or sports gel
would it help have that be candy or
sugar does that improve your performance
really no it's going to spike your blood
sugars and it's going to come down and
you're going to get tired not to mention
so many of the keto products right
they're supposed to be keto friendly
they're not very keto friendly and this
could definitely be one reason uh why
people might try keto with some of these
products
unknowingly not able to get into keto
because of the amount of hidden
maltodextrin and then maybe say well
keto didn't work let me go on to the
next diet so I just wanted to create
this video to teach you a tool that you
can use using simple iodine and since
we're on the topic of maltodextrin if
you haven't seen this video you
definitely need to check it out I put it
up right here

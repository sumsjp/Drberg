now if you've been watching my channel this video is probably not for you
but it's for your friends and family that eat carbohydrates because we know you
are on the ketogenic diet so if you have friends and family that are not on the ketogenic diet
you can show them this video but the question is why do people crave salt after they eat
sweet or even after they eat some carbohydrate we're going to talk about why that is
so let's say for example your friend not you eat some cake drink some soda eats candy cookies
a donut ice cream and then later that day or night start craving some salt they need some
chips right they need something salty why is that because when you start getting high blood glucose
there's too much sugar in the blood sodium starts leaking out of your cells
because of what glucose does to the cell it's very osmotic which i don't want to get into the details
on the mechanism but just realize that when you have high glucose in your blood you tend to lose
sodium in certain places in the body and you also become deficient in potassium
so you have hyponatremia which is low sodium and hypokalemia which is low potassium
now the symptom of low sodium would be you crave salt and you can actually develop a headache or
have adrenal stress you can feel more stress and this is why sometimes when people eat more salt
they they feel calm they can actually relax and their cravings go away their headaches go away at
least for a minute but what are the cravings for low potassium there is none you're not going to
crave a big salad after this event are you usually not because there's no cravings when you're low in
potassium even though you should be consuming a high potassium food like a big salad people don't
the ratio of sodium to potassium should be one to two you should always have twice as much potassium
so here's a person who eats the carb then they eat the salt they satisfy this
but they don't satisfy potassium because when you actually just have more salt
without the potassium you create even more of a deficiency of potassium if you look at the ratios
and then all sorts of other things will happen you may get palpitations you may feel this loud
pounding in the ear inner ear like your heartbeat is like that on the pillow when
you're trying to sleep you're going to have a hard time sleeping because potassium is a physiological
tranquilizer it relaxes you potassium also gives you energy so you may feel fatigue you may feel
out of breath when you're going up the stairs potassium also is involved with preventing leg
cramps because it's an electrolyte and it's needed in the muscles for various things so for those of
you that are on carbs you don't want to forget about this potassium to take that either in a
supplement or an electrolyte or just a large salad but for those of you that are regularly
watching my videos you don't have to worry about this whole thing because you're not eating carbs

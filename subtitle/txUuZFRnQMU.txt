vitamin d is the absolute most important vitamin for asthma now the symptoms of asthma wheezing
shortness of breath chest tightness cough and someone that's an asthmatic is always vitamin
d deficient and it's the vitamin d deficiency that causes changes in the thickness where the
gas exchange occurs in your lung also changes in the mass volume of the lung itself in the
composition itself and the smooth muscle and so there's a lot of structural things that are
being altered when you have asthma mainly due to inflammation now the surface area of the lungs if
you if you take the lungs and spread it out would be the size of a tennis court extremely large and
the length of all the airways if you were to stretch them out it would be about 1500 miles
so there's an incredible amount of surface area and the primary function
of the lung is gas exchange you're breathing in oxygen and you're breathing out co2 and at the
lining of your lung tissue where it's exposed to air you have some serious immune protection
and it's very very uh complex because your your immune system has to identify
a non-threatening airborne particle that doesn't need to stir up the immune system versus an actual
deadly virus or a pathogen and that's to identify which is which and deal with it appropriately
and so with asthma there's two areas in the immune system where things are not working that well
one is with the t helper cell and then the next thing is with the t regulatory cell both of these
immune cells are involved in the coordination of immune reactions and regulating inflammation to
make sure there's not too much inflammation and so when there's a dysfunction of both of these cells
you get inflammation and that's what's really causing the change in thickness the volume the
composition and the smooth muscles and so now not only do we not get the gas exchange
but we also get a hypersensitivity to various triggers so we get this over reaction in the
immune system and so inflammation is easily triggered now the other point i want to make about
asthma is that one of the most popular treatment is a bronchocorticosteroid inhaler
and that is basically this mist that you put in your lungs it's cortisol and it's a vasodilator
so with asthma we have a problem with the immune system we obviously have the problem with the lung
and we have the problem with the hormone cortisol so the good news is vitamin d can start to turn
around and remodel in a positive way your lungs it can slow down and stop inflammation and stop
the fibrosis that's going on which is the scar tissue and vitamin d also helps reset or normalize
the cortisol receptor allowing cortisol to work better in your lungs and not only that but vitamin
d is really a hormone and it acts very similar to cortisol it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory
and so if you have asthma and you're not taking vitamin d you're missing out big time i'm going
to recommend at least 20,000 IUs vitamin d3 every single day and you should notice great changes in
your ability to breathe and reduce these symptoms right here before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

so I have a question for you are you finding that fasting is interfering with
your ability to sleep through the night now I've actually spent quite a bit of
time to try to find research on this point and all I could find is just a
very tiny bit of research in animal studies ok mice studies however I do know
quite a few people who have told me that their sleep is not as good when they're
doing fasting this could be the reason right here so in the study energy
restriction was applied for 2 to 7 days 2 to 7 days of fasting and what they
found is that decrease is nocturnal that means at night secretion of melatonin
this is the hormone that helps you sleep by 20% so if you're finding that when
you're putting your pet mouse on a fasting program and they're not sleeping
you want to do two things and I'm being very sarcastic you can actually apply
this to yourself as well you want to add MCT oil to your diet right before bed or
you can try this increase your carbohydrates to 50 grams and that
should help maybe add more berries something like that and you'll find that
you'll do a little bit better and the reason for that is that chances are you
have insulin resistance and it's probably been there for a long time and
it's gonna take a while for you to adapt you see what you have to realize is that
glucose is one fuel of the brain and so is ketones
the majority population has insulin resistance and it's affecting their
cognitive function and we don't know exactly but it it's almost as if there's
a the blood-brain barrier gets insulin resistance okay and what happens is that
the cells of the brain don't get the glucose and so when you have an
Alzheimer's patient what's really happening with the neurons is it's
starving of glucose and that's what happens when you have insulin resistance
and guess what is in the brain you have the mechanism that control sleep it's in
the front part of the hypothalamus it's called this
super suprachiasmatic nucleus not that you need to know that but anything in the
brain is going to be affected when you have insulin resistance so what you're
gonna find after you do keto and intermittent fasting
over a period of time the pineal cells will start adapting more and more and
your sleep will do better but in the process you may need to add some MCT oil
which will give the brain ketones and feed the pineal gland directly or you
can actually just increase your carbs a little bit more and see which one works
for you now if you haven't seen my video on all the different ways to stimulate
melatonin that might be a good video to watch next I put it right here on the
screen and a link down below

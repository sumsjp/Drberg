today we're going to talk about those people who just cannot confront
fasting now maybe you can do intermittent fasting but when you talk about prolonged fasting
they can't do it so let's talk about what you can do to overcome that it is true that when
you deprive food or you tell someone you're going to go to bed hungry it brings up a whole can of
worms because just the fact of depriving yourself of food is anti-survival it goes
against your survival on a mental level now physically when you do prolonged fasting
if you can overcome some of the barriers you will actually feel way better when you don't eat
versus when you eat but the barriers you're going to have to go up against are
all the different smells that are going to occur in your house when other people are cooking
the visual foods that you're going to see and commercials and also in your house and also
you're going to go up against all the different habits that you have now with eating snacking and
you know preparing certain foods and social events etc etc not to mention all the wonderful pleasure
memories you have connected to foods so that's really what you're up against and let me not
forget the growling of your stomach which really only happens a little bit in the beginning and
then it goes away so those are a few barriers so there's three things you need to know number one
when you do this correctly you will not have any hunger your hunger goes away because you're in
ketosis which is going to make it a lot easier so that's number one number two there are many
good reasons to do prolonged fasting that go way beyond just weight loss
number one your cognitive function your sense of clarity your ability to be in the present
your awareness goes up your perceptions go up with your even your vision your sense of smell your
sense of taste when you go back to eating improves you have more attention so if you were add you're
going to be less ADD when you do this so it really strengthens your cognitive function you may even
find you're a little bit smarter okay also your mood your mood goes up you're not as grouchy
prolonged fasting can actually fix your immune system so let's say for example you
had an allergy to something or you had some other type of inflammatory condition like an autoimmune
condition fasting can help correct that if you have a body problem whether it's diabetes or some
other degenerative condition prolonged fasting can help if you have cancer or pre-cancer cells
fasting is essential for killing cancer cells and number three which is the next point i want
to bring up is all you really have to do is get over the hump there's a certain fear of
the unknown that you have to just jump in use some discipline and just get started and then what will
happen is as you get more and more into ketosis you start experiencing these great benefits
it's going to make it easier and easier and easier so maybe you just plan out doing it for 48 hours
and then find out that you can go longer and longer and longer up to 72 hours so that's
what i would recommend and of course before you even start prolonged fasting whether it's 48 or
72 hours or longer i recommend doing intermittent fasting for a while just to get your body used to
it make sure you're also doing the electrolytes trace minerals b vitamins and sea salt very
very important just to make sure that you don't create any deficiencies that can create dizziness
one person that i knew did prolong fasting and he passed out because he didn't have any electrolytes
and he he basically got knocked out when his head hit something so that that's not good but
the bottom line is you've been eating your whole life and letting your body dictate things and run
this show what you're going to find when you flip this and you start running your body and
telling it when to eat and when not to eat you're going to find all sorts of magical things occur so
i challenge you to try prolonged fasting and see for yourself before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

know how many positive aspects but lets us talk about the cons all right number one you're going

that's a negative you might go broke buying new clothes but at least you'll look good right not
good for people who are trying to gain weight if you're really really skinny not the best thing

to stay home right that could be a situation or you can just go out there and just hang out
with them number four may offend people there's a lot of people that want to offer you food and

you like to crunch on chips at night well you can't do that anymore number six not good for

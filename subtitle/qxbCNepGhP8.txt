so what is the best treatment for those annoying eye floaters that 70% of the population has
well it's a very simple and inexpensive solution it actually is going to be free but let me
just first explain what an eye floater is it's a strange little worm-like cobweb piece of something
in your eye that tends to float around especially if you try to focus in on it or when you look away
now it's not dangerous but it's just annoying what it actually is is a piece of collagen fiber
that creates a shadow in the back part of the eye the retina that gives you this image and
this usually comes from some type of breakdown tissue in the inside of the eye whether it's from
internal bleeding or some type of inflammation from white blood cells now ninety percent of the
time it's from the aging process it could be from some old injury an infection or some blood sugar
situation because diabetics or pre-diabetics normally have a lot more eye floaters than people
who don't because high blood sugars directly affect the eye it actually breaks down eye
tissue but regardless of all that the solution is autophagy for those of you that have been watching
my videos in my channel you know what this is but if for those of you that are new autophagy is a
condition where your body is recycling old damaged protein so your body is taking these old proteins
recycling them and making them into new proteins and the biggest thing that stimulates this is
fasting so a combination of intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting like
72 hours or even 48 hours every so often would be the absolute best thing you can do to help get rid
of these floaters now there's no studies on this that i have found but you might want to try it
because not only is it not expensive it's actually free but you'll see a lot of other benefits that
go beyond just getting rid of your eye floaters so if you're new to my channel i put a link down
below of exactly how to do this hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

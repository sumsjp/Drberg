did you realize that the average person in the u.s is exposed to EMFs for over 10 hours a day
this really shocked me but if you look at it it does make sense because we're exposed to
your smartphones computers laptops wi-fi internet routers microwaves
and the list goes on and these devices are putting out invisible electromagnetic fields that
definitely interact with our own body's electrical fields both in our brain in
our heart and even in deep into the cell but the good news is this that experts assure us that emfs
are not harmful there's no link between EMFs and anything negative about your health but
i don't know if i agree with that because there's a report that was put out in 2012 that evaluated
2 000 studies and they found that this low-level radiation can play a role not just in alzheimer's
but a lot of different conditions it can affect your blood pressure it can affect your pulse rate
it can cause you to have insomnia it can make you tired it can affect your cognitive function focus
memory concentration it can actually raise your inflammation cause muscle aches and mood changes
and even increase your risk for getting a stroke or a heart attack and it can cause dna damage
other than that it's perfectly healthy according to the experts and so the EMF waves affect
the channels the communication channels in your cells they're calcium channels people
know that calcium is involved with bone but they don't realize that calcium is the main
mineral involved with communication through the membranes of every single cell and these emf
energy waves directly affect the communication channels across all your cellular membranes so
presently we are doing a huge experiment on the human population with EMFs so i'm going to highly
recommend doing three things number one you have to start limiting exposure to EMF okay the way to
do that is to get a emf tester i'm going to put a link down below of the one that i use it's pretty
easy to use and i've created a couple videos to explain how to use it and you just turn it on
and you can measure three things individually the electrical fields and then separately the
magnetic fields and i explain what that means in the videos down below but if you have one of these
testers you can measure on your desk where you sleep and a fascinating experiment is to measure
your microwave if you have one and you're gonna be quite shocked uh how far these microwaves transmit
through your kitchen it's quite scary actually and the next time you use your microwave you're
gonna definitely stand probably outside the room when you use it all right number two
keep your cell phone and other devices away from your head okay do not do this
keep it away from your head uh use your speaker phone i talked about certain type of external
headphones or earphones that you can use that limit the amount of radiation that goes right
up into your brain and then number three you want to increase your antioxidant network why because
there's a lot of oxidation a lot of free radical damage occurring when you're exposed to these emfs
so you want to beef up no pun intended in your antioxidant network a lot of raw vegetables would
help cruciferous vegetables healthier foods and fasting can all increase your antioxidant network
that can help counter a lot of the emf effects from your daily exposure
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

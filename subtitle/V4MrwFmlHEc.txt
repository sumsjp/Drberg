let's talk about cholesterol menopause and aging as we get older our cholesterol does go up
typically men have higher cholesterol than women but during menopause there usually is a spike in
cholesterol in women now before i get too much into that i just want to let you know that the
body does make cholesterol it makes a lot in fact 75 to 80 percent of all the cholesterol in your
body is made by your own body why because all of your cell membranes need it also cholesterol is
required to make bile vitamin d and sex hormones estrogen progesterone testosterone cortisol and
there's several other hormones but the question is why would a female going through menopause
have an increased amount of cholesterol well it has to do with this hormone right here estrogen
as the estrogen decreases during menopause which happens dramatically and significantly
you're going to get an increase in cholesterol because estrogen acts as an antioxidant and as
we have less antioxidants we're more susceptible to getting damage in the arteries in different
parts of the body and so you really want to look at cholesterol as the firemen to put up the fire
so cholesterol is really a band-aid to come in there with the help of calcium and some protein to
seal the lesion or the inflamed damaged artery and so to understand cholesterol very simply you have
two types you have ldl hdl these are proteins that are transporting the cholesterol in and out of
the liver so the ldl which is considered the bad cholesterol is really transporting the cholesterol
from the liver to the cell and the hdl which is considered the good is transporting it back
from the cell back to the liver for recycling so as long as we have an exchange there
we're totally fine now i've done videos on this recently when you have high ldl what you have to
realize is there's two types of ldl one is a bad one is a good and so i recently released a video
on my wife's cholesterol which was high as well as the ldl but if you look deeper and you take
an advanced lipid profile you'll notice if the person's on a low carb diet and they're eating
healthy that the type of ldl is actually the large buoyant it's not the small dense and so it's not
the bad type of ldl but my wife actually has gone through menopause she has decreased estrogen
and so she has less antioxidants and so one of the things she does is she eats a lot of food with
antioxidants which i recommend to everyone and so the significance of this video is this if you are
going through menopause if you're getting older okay you're going to have less of these right here
so that means that you have to eat cleaner you have to have less sugar and less refined carbs
and that will keep this from creating damage and you won't need the firemen to come in to patch
anything up and secondly at the same time you want to make sure you're having enough
food high in antioxidants to counter any effect of a drop in
estrogen hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

let's talk about the best form of broccoli now what is so special about broccoli well it has a
very interesting compound called sulforaphane and sulforaphane has been heavily studied it activates
the nrf2 pathway in your body well it will help you express over 200 different genes relating
to producing more antioxidants helping you with inflammation it's a powerful anti-inflammatory
and it helps to turn poisons into harmless particles and so it helps you detoxify certain
things in the liver but what i think is more interesting is it's anti-cancer properties in
fact john hopkins university or at least someone in that university tried to get the patents
on broccoli sprouts long ago until they found out you can't patent a sprout so if they were trying
to get patents there must be something to these broccoli sprouts which we're going to talk about
but sulfurophane helps to excrete carcinogens things that can trigger cancer so not only does
it have anti-cancer properties it helps get rid of those things that can cause cancer it's also
good for your cardiovascular system so let's go ahead and compare raw broccoli to broccoli sprouts
and this is going to be based in the same amounts 100 grams so in raw broccoli we have
sulforaphane being 44 to 171 milligrams now if we compare that to broccoli sprouts we have a
thousand 153 milligrams that's 10 times as much sulforaphane as in raw broccoli you wouldn't
necessarily have to keep making broccoli sprouts you can get it in a powder as well all right now
let's take a look at calcium calcium is 42 milligrams versus a 78 milligrams so it has
twice as much calcium and then vitamin a and raw broccoli has 567 international units versus 300
international units in broccoli sprouts and you have vitamin c 89 milligrams versus 58 milligrams
iron 700 milligrams versus 720 milligrams so if you want the benefits of sulforaphane
definitely do the broccoli sprouts now there's one more point i want to bring up
absorption okay so when you're consuming raw broccoli you're getting about 19% absorption
as compared to the broccoli sprouts you're getting 74 percent absorption
and because sulforaphane is a fat soluble compound if you consume it with a meal or with some
olive oil or another fat you can get even better absorption so if you're enjoying my content

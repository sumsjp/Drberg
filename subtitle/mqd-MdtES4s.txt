let's talk about how sugar specifically high blood sugar affects your immune
system okay we're talking about hyper glycaemia it has a huge effect on
suppressing your immune system in fact hyperglycemia diabetes is one of the big
factors involved in the COVID situation massively increasing your risk for
mortality number one high blood sugar inhibits chemotaxis now what is that
that is the movement of white blood cells through the body towards where
they need to do their work like an infection or a part of the body that's
damaged so it's the movement of white blood cells triggered by certain
chemicals in the body number two we have impaired phagocytosis phagocytosis is
the mechanism where certain white blood cells will engulf and eat and kill
pathogens viruses bacteria fungus mold and there's two main phagocytes you have
the neutrophils okay neutrophils make up 90% of all the pus in your body after an
infection and they're very short-lived so you have less neutrophils and then
macrophages are the big phagocytes that are professional phagocytes and they
basically are the guard to protect you and they will just go around and golfing
pathogens and eating them up and putting them in these little vesicles and
dumping acid in there hydrogen peroxide the main ingredient in Bleach and that's
how they kill these microbes so you have less neutrophils less macrophages and
you have less of their weapon tree so you pretty much just take down a big
part of the body's army when you have high sugar or when you consume a lot of
sugar number three you have inhibited complement cascade now what is that
well complement cascade is a series of events that occur that will cause the
bacterial membrane to burst so basically it's a mechanism to help kill bacteria
number four when you have high levels of sugar in
the blood you develop acidosis so the pH starts to go down that's more acidic and
that by itself inhibits immunity number five it slows the white blood cells
moving through the tissues now these white blood cells are fascinating
because they have the ability to actually go right through your tissues
right through the lymphatic system through organs through blood vessels so
all that movement is inhibited so it would be comparable to let's say having
your own army and they had to walk through a huge muddy field and they were
getting stuck and it couldn't move that well that's what happens to your immune
system now one of the big effects of having high blood sugar is the
destruction of the vascular system especially to the nerves to other parts
of the body so with high sugar you're gonna have less oxygen through the body
and with that you're gonna have an increase microbes that can live in that
environment they're called anaerobes they're pathogens that live
in areas that don't require oxygen fungus candida and this is going to
increase the risk for infection fungal infections Candida infections and many
other types of pathogens and lastly you're going to have less of an innate
immunity and that's part of the immune system that is the wall okay so you have
the skin and then you have the inner skin and hyperglycemia destroys those
barriers so now we don't have that protection like we did when we were
healthy so if you personally have hyperglycemia and you're diabetic you
need to learn about healthy keto and intermittent fasting I put a video up
just for you right here check it out

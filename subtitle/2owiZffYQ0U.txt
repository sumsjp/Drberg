so i get this question periodically you know i'm losing five pounds in a month is that normal
um well it depends but most people would say it's not normal you should be losing a lot more
and especially if you compare yourself to your spouse or a friend that's losing a lot more you're
like wow it's not working right when you evaluate anything you you're always comparing two things
okay you're comparing what's normal and what's going on with you to find out what's going on
and it's very very important for you to know what is normal okay how much fat can a person burn per
week in an ideal situation with a good metabolism well that data is two pounds two pounds of fat per
week that's like the best case scenario now i'm not talking about when you're fasting if you were
to fast for a week you would lose probably about three and a half a little bit more pounds per week
so in a month that comes out to eight pounds right so if you're losing five pounds you're like okay
what's wrong this is not normal i should be losing two pounds like dr berg said yeah i said that but
i also said that's the ideal situation for someone with a healthy fast metabolism you might have a
slow metabolism in which case you may only lose one pound per week so what is normal for a person
with a slow metabolism it's actually a half a pound a week to one pound of fat loss per week
so four pounds of fat loss per month is not bad for someone with a slow metabolism
it could be even two pounds now let's say for example you drink alcohol maybe on the weekends
maybe you drank four times this month okay there's some other information you need to know
and that is this all it takes is a tiny amount of carbohydrate to block fat burning for a good
amount of time for two to three days because you just knocked yourself out of ketosis okay
it's important to know this that's normal so when you're evaluating that could be the reason because
if you take that those lost 8 to 12 days of fat burning away from that month now that changes
everything okay if you had a healthy metabolism and you lost 2 pounds a week times 3 that's six
pounds and you might think that's abnormal when in fact that is normal based on what you did
so there are various things that you need to know um to have the correct conclusions and to not be
so frustrated if you're not sleeping another big factor because when you're not sleeping
it's almost like you're eating sugar because it affects your blood sugars it increases cortisol
same thing with stress stress is like eating candy because it can release sugar from the body
so these are all disfactors to look at so you're not so frustrated so you know what normal is so
you stick to it and you don't give up when it's actually working that would be devastating there's
always something you can do to improve things you can fast longer if you're at two meals a day go
to one meal a day if you're at one meal a day and you're not hungry just go to once every other day
but fasting is a very powerful way to improve insulin resistance to improve your metabolism
and to speed things up and i'm not just talking about just not eating losing weight i'm talking
about what it's doing to your body health-wise huge all right thanks for watching hey before

i wanted to do a quick video to
introduce you to what i think
is the best diet structure for autism
okay now i put a link down below of some
really interesting research on this
topic
and if my child had autism
this is where i would start now i'm not
going to create
all the details with meal plans i want
to give you the big idea the overview
uh the percentages of of the macros
in creating a meal plan for someone with
autism
but if you follow this structure based
on the research that i'm seeing you'll
see
significant improvement in your child's
communication skills
their ability to socialize with other
people their cognitive function
their demeanor their ability to have
self-control
so you might want to try this now the
typical ketogenic diet
is about five percent carbs 20 protein
and 75 fat i'm going to recommend a
tweaked ketogenic diet
where you're increasing your fat to 80
to 90 percent
fat and so this is a very similar diet
to
the diet for kids that have epilepsy
okay it's called a traditional ketogenic
diet
but i'm going to recommend the healthy
version
of that diet by adding more fat but
keeping the ingredients
healthy because we want to provide the
nutrients we don't want to put these
other things in there
now i would recommend 25 of these fats
being
mct oil not butter not ghee
mct oil why because mct oil
will give your child ketones immediately
and that's what we're trying to do we're
trying to flood the brain
with a massive amount of ketones with a
very
low amount of glucose because we have to
bypass certain mechanisms
that are preventing glucose from feeding
the cells
and so this will feed the cells directly
and you'll start to see improvement of
the brain tissue
pretty quickly as far as the carbs go i
would recommend
bringing the carbs down around 10 to 20
grams okay so you're going to have to
really pay attention to that
now i know that's kind of vague but i
don't want to get into in this video
counting calories and doing this or that
i just want to kind of give you the
overview
and i will do other videos on the more
the details
but when you're doing the mct oil you
can bypass the
a lot of mechanisms in the liver and the
gallbladder so the body can then take
these ketones
directly right in really quick
all right so we want to do a healthy
version of the ketogenic diet we
definitely want to do
veggies non-starchy a lot of fiber
we want to do a lot of leafy greens or
even green powder
if your child will not eat vegetables
because we want to add phytonutrients
and some of the other nutrients
in these greens i would highly recommend
that you don't do any dairy
or casein which is the protein in milk
because
it's been found that that could
aggravate the brain also
you don't want to do any gluten okay
don't use any grains
you don't want to do even ghee why
because ghee doesn't have
nearly the amount of medium chain
triglycerides
that mct oil has okay from usually from
coconuts
and so we want to provide the body the
best absorption
and the maximum amount of ketones
so roughly you're going to be feeding
your child
fatty meats fatty sausage
coconut oil would be a good thing talo
which is beef fat
eggs fatty fish fatty nuts like pecans
and macadamia nuts
and then on top of that you want to add
electrolytes okay
a really good electrolyte powder without
any sugar b vitamins
preferably from nutritional yeast or
another natural source
and trace minerals okay that way
they can have all the nutrition and be
fed the
exact right fuel to help repair
brain tissue so stay tuned for more
videos on this topic
and go ahead and comment down below hey
before you go

content i would
love to hear about your success story

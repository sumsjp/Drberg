so i want to talk about a very interesting herbal remedy
for rheumatoid arthritis and it's called thunder god vine here's the
plant's name right here but we're just going to call it twhf
how about that this plant as a remedy in certain cultures has been used for
hundreds and hundreds of years but apparently as an anti-inflammatory
it works really good for rheumatoid arthritis but
it also creates some positive effects for ankylosing spondylitis
and psoriasis these are autoimmune diseases
and there's also benefits for alzheimer's and dementia
obesity and even cancer here you have this natural remedy
hundreds of years so in the articles that you read about
this you'll see all sorts of conflicting information
you should use advanced caution from using this herb because it could create
you know some pretty serious side effects in frequent periods
diarrhea and nausea okay well doesn't seem to be that serious to me
you'll see you could take up to 570 milligrams per day
and it's completely safe now in some of these articles that you would read
they're talking about use extreme caution on this herb that's been around
for hundreds of years it's been used very successfully it'll
start talking about this compound right here which is called
celestrol where they're extracting a bioactive compound
from this plant and of course getting the patents on it okay they have
patents for alzheimer's i think there's one for obesity right here
and of course when you patent certain extracts from nature
now you're competing with natural things so
it makes a lot of sense that you're going to have to emphasize the dangers
the side effects of this plant well what about the side effects from this vital
nutrient high blood pressure muscle atrophy
infertility and a slight minor complication of a 27 percent
mortality rate let's see let's compare these side effects to these side effects
hmm which one actually seems to be worse i think i'm going to go with
the natural one over here i'm not making any claims is this going to cure your
arthritis or any of these diseases check with your doctor before taking any
of my recommendation but if you have an autoimmune disease
especially rheumatoid you may want to research this natural
herb because it potentially could help you

i'm going to show you how to maximize the anti-cancer effects of garlic okay now when you
combine these two chemicals crush them together alan which is an amino acid and alanis which is
an enzyme both in the garlic clove you get this chemical called allicin so to maximize this
potent anti-cancer chemical okay and it can kill cancer different ways too it's not just one way
you have to crush it and you have to wait 10 minutes okay to maximize the effect
if you crush it and consume it too fast you won't get the maximum benefits if you crush it or don't
crush it and you heat it you destroy 99% of allicin and you lose those anti-cancer effects not a good
at situation same thing if you microwave it and another problem people have is they take these
garlic cloves and they just stick it in their their stew or their food but they don't crush it
so we need to crush it okay you can chop it also if you soak it in acid you will diminish
allicin so don't add it with apple cider vinegar also if you put it in very very hot tea that can
also limit the potency okay because again heat can inhibit this enzyme action and of course we
know about what it does to your breath so you can just add some mint or chew on some mint leaves and
that works like a charm but garlic specifically allicin has potent anti-cancer effects it's great
to support your blood sugars it's fantastic for cardiovascular function including thinning of
the blood okay to prevent a clot helping regulate your cholesterol if you're concerned about that
and helping with lowering your blood pressure it's also antimicrobial big time so if there's any type
of fungus or infection going on in your body take garlic garlic also helps increase your endurance
so if you want to go longer without getting tired when you're exercising
garlic is the answer for that and garlic is very anti-inflammatory and there's so many conditions
that involve inflammation especially arthritis all right so there you go now you know how to enhance

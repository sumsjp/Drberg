Hey, guys, Dr. Berg here.
I want to answer the question, "Will vegetables slow your ketosis?"
This is a common question I keep getting over and over again.
Typically, no, especially if you're going to avoid certain vegetables like, of course,
corn and maybe beets or carrots.
If we actually eliminate those, no, you do not have to worry about the vegetable family.
In fact, I've never run into a problem with it.
In fact, most traditional ketosis diet does not differentiate the type of carbohydrate.
They're always just saying, "Well, just have your 50 grams of carbohydrate."
What I want to recommend is that you try to get your 50 grams from the vegetable family.
You can even go higher than that if you're just doing like leafy greens and bitter vegetables
that are not very sweet and celery, things like that.
Typically, on a ketosis diet, you want about 50 grams, but if your metabolism is really
slow and maybe you're a little bit older and you've destroyed your metabolism in the past,
you might need to go down the 43rd or even 20 grams of carbohydrate.
You might want to go lower.
The other thing that you might want to do if you're having difficulty is count the total
carbs on the label, not the net carbs.
The net carbs are basically just take the total carbs and minus the fiber, because sometimes
these fibers can influence the blood sugars even though they're insatiable on some people.
The other things that I want to talk bout is that I really, really recommend that you'd
consume vegetables with a ketosis diet simply to prevent a fatty liver because you're going
to be dumping all this fat out of the body.
It's going to be burned and you're switching from one fuel source to the next, and so if
you don't consume the vegetables, it could actually end up with more fat dumping in the
liver.
You want to keep the vegetables very, very high and you don't have to worry about vegetables
if you're trying to get into ketosis.
Thanks for watching.

so many people when they actually travel from the u.s to europe and they consume wheat products
they have no bloating they don't have near the digestive problems they don't even necessarily
gain weight now i am definitely not recommending consuming wheat but i want to talk about the
difference between wheat from america versus wheat from europe there's a huge difference when people
are consuming breads and pastas and cereals and crackers and biscuits in the united states
they get acne they get bloating they get a lot of inflammation in their gut they also have lethargy
they're tired but you don't really see as much of that in europe at least from the wheat why is
that what is the differences well in america sixty percent of the wheat is red wheat now what is red
wheat compared to certain countries in europe they use white wheat so red wheat is soft it's fluffy
it has a longer shelf life it has a lot more carbohydrate and it has much more protein
specifically gluten the wheat that they use in europe has much less gluten that's the protein in
wheat that causes a lot of the problems in the gut but that's not the only difference in america the
wheat is not necessarily genetically modified but they use glyphosate in a lot of the wheat which is
the chemical they normally spray on genetically modified crops now they say glyphosate is not
harmful to humans it's only harmful to bacteria but the problem is humans have a lot of bacteria
growing inside and outside their bodies in fact humans are dependent on their microorganisms
so glyphosate directly attacks this microbiome and disturbs the flora and the ability for someone to
digest now gmo foods in general and glyphosate is banned in many european countries now there's
one more point i want to bring up but it has to do with iron fortification so in grain products that
are refined they tend to fortify it with synthetic vitamins and iron and of course the source of iron
that they're using to fortify is actually not the type that your body can easily break down
this type of iron that's fortified in wheat in america kind of sits in your gut
it tends to generate more pathogenic bacteria and then if we compare this to european countries
like france denmark and sweden and other countries they use no fortification at all
so i just wanted to do this video to talk about the difference from the america versus european
wheat of course i'm not recommending consuming wheat i'm just talking about the difference so

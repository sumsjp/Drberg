hey guys today we're going to talk about grass-fed the benefits of grass-fed
which actually go way beyond just omega-3 fatty acids and I'm talking
about grass-fed beef grass-fed animal products so if we
compare grass-fed to grain-fed there's up to five times more omega-3 fatty
acids and there is grain-fed not to mention the fact that grass-fed has much
lower amounts of omega-6 fatty acids which are inflammatory if you look at
the ratio it's like seven to one versus a fifteen to one omega-6 to omega-3 and
grass-fed is seven omega-6 to one omega-3 there's also more CLA that's a
healthy type of fat it acts as an antioxidant in the body and also it's
good for cardiovascular function there's three times more there's also more
vitamins there's more minerals there's more trace minerals and there's more
antioxidants okay and I'm talking carotenoids coming from the grass I
don't even think there's any carotenoids in the grain-fed but here's the big
point I want to bring up grain-fed and I'm talking soy and corn are GM Oh which
means they have glyphosate residues this is the problem grass-fed usually does
not have glyphosate residue especially if it's organic and this is the thing
that people don't realize they allow up to 20 times more class 8 residue and
they call it glyphosate tolerance for animal feeds then plants okay other
crops now when you're buying certain vegetables at the store for your salad
for example if there is exposure to glyphosate it's going to be 20 times
less than animal feeds so basically you are getting a lot of herbicide when you
consume that animal because it came from the actual animal feeds and realize it's
a cumulative and the reason that they spray the crops in the first place is to
kill the weeds so when they make them genetically modified they're basically
making them resist glyphosate okay it's called Roundup Ready
so the crop does not die only the the weeds dime so the problem is you get
exposed to this glyphosate and glyphosate really messes with your micro
flora your friendly bacteria it blocks the bacteria's ability to make protein
the ability to detoxify so you actually accumulate more toxins when you get more
exposure to glyphosate those are just a couple things there's much more I'll put
a link down below for more information on that but when you go shopping and buy
your meats and especially when you go to like wholesale grocery stores like BJ
and Costco you're seeing a lot more grass-fed you're seeing a lot more
organic so the price is coming down a little bit
always go for grass-fed not conventional grain-fed hey before you go would you
mind putting a comment down below to tell me what you think about this video

let's talk about the most widely used pesticide in the world now it's really hard to pronounce but
your chances are you probably have it in your body right now klaw-pai-ri-fos it's on your fruit it's
in your vegetables it's on the golf courses and they detected this pesticide in 90 percent of u.s
households but it's in europe as well but it's been banned in several european countries as
well as several states in the u.s i think it's california new york new jersey and connecticut
there might have been one more it's in your soy the corn the apples cilantro bell peppers
snap peas peaches you name it it's all over the place here's the problem if you compare this to
glyphosate which is an herbicide which kills weeds this pesticide kills pests and insects which means
that it affects more animals and humans which is a little different than a chemical that kills weeds
and there is no acceptable dose to avoid brain damage in a study in 2016 9 out of 10 children
and mothers had this chemical in their body on urine samples and i think it was actually in fat
cells there's been some interesting studies and relationship between this chemical and increased
risk of autism but of course if you read up on the internet they're going to talk about the safety
it was involved in 4,000 different studies but many of these studies were sponsored by the
industry that made this chemical but what's really mind-blowing is that there's 34,000
different pesticides that are registered by the epa there are so many chemicals
in our environment and there are 85,000 more that are regulated separately for other purposes so my
point being is your it's going to be impossible to avoid these chemicals yes you need to do organic
but there's something else that you need to realize your liver and other organs make an enzyme
that help you detoxify these chemicals naturally it's part of the phase 1 phase 2 detoxification
system and as long as you keep your body healthy and consume things like cruciferous vegetables on
a regular basis that can greatly help you prevent these chemicals from accumulating and one last
important thing and i've talked about this many times in other videos is fasting fasting increases
your ability to detoxify these chemicals so those are the two tips for today start
consuming cruciferous and start fasting hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

alright guys so today we're going to talk about how to eat whatever you want
and still lose your belly fat is it possible yes it is okay but you have to
follow this one very vital important rule and this tip by the way is for the
lazy the procrastinator if you're a professional procrastinator this data is
for you here's what you're gonna do you're not going to change what you eat
you're gonna change the pattern of when you eat okay and we're gonna make it
incredibly easy as a stepping stone to get into this eating plan so here's the
rule you only eat from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. that
is a 4-hour eating window that gives you 20 hours of fasting so you can eat
nothing past 5 okay all through the night all the way to the next day until
1 o'clock p.m. that's gonna be your first meal now you can drink water you
can do tea things like that you can also drink coffee in the morning just with a
little bit of cream make sure the cream is whole cream grass-fed but just have a
little bit just enough alright if that's too hard for you we can we're gonna have
to step it back this is what you're gonna do your first meal will be at 12
noon okay and your last meal will be at 6 so that will give us a 6 hour
eating window and 18 hours of fasting still doable ok but if that is still too
hard for you and you just have to eat all day long then we're gonna we're
gonna back it up and do this one little step make sure the coffee in the morning
is bulletproof which means you're going to add MCT oil and butter I'll put a
link down below if you don't know what that means and then once you're
comfortable with this you can step it up and do this part right here which is
basically the four hour window eating period with a 20 hour fasting what
that's going to do it's going to majorly drop insulin big time and realize
insulin is the hormone that prevents you from tapping into your fat and this is
based on the fact that every time you eat you spike insulin okay so it's not
just about increasing carbohydrates in that converting into fat it's
about the frequency of eating that is really a killer for most people that's
all those health so-called healthy snacks that you've been consuming very
bad now what's going to happen after about a week your hunger is going to go
down your cravings are going to go down it's going to make it easier to close
this window a little bit more so let's just say for example you're not hungry
at 1:00 o'clock well wait till you are hungry maybe at
2:00 and then maybe at 3:00 till you're eventually at one meal a day that would
actually help you lose a lot of belly fat now during this process of course if
you want to take it to the next level we want to increase the quality of food so
to do that you must eliminate the sugars to refined carbs the starches I put a
link down below of a mini course to take you step-by-step to teach you how to do
that as well so if we combine the quality of food and lowering the
carbohydrates within a minute of fasting you're going to be extremely successful
but the reason I want to create this video is for those people that just
aren't going to do it because it's too hard stop sending me and they need a
simple way to get started to make it a little bit easier so go ahead and do
this and put your comments down below thanks for watching

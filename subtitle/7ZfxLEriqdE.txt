all right so i'm going through all the questions and here's another question that someone wanted to
know about um is it okay to consume celery and nut butter on keto well absolutely yes because it's a
good alternative to salad for some people it's really hard to get people to consume the amount
of salad they need but it's very easy to consume celery if you're going to add peanut butter to it
and also when i say peanut butter make sure it's organic make sure it doesn't have any added sugar
make sure there's no extra oils in there other than just peanut oil you don't want soy oil or
cottonseed oil or any of that stuff so for some people it's just an easy way to get
your vegetable and um it's something that tastes good as well so um i do recommend it um and if
you're using it for a salad substitute i would highly recommend consuming a good amount of it
not just like a tiny little bit but celery itself is extremely low carb but high fiber and yes it
is true that fiber is a carb but fiber does not affect your blood sugars other than help improve
it because your microbes eat the fiber and they give you certain chemicals to help regulate blood
sugars it has zero starch and per cup it has 262 milligrams of potassium and it has 80 milligrams
of sodium you may have heard that celery is very high in sodium and you have to avoid it for high
blood pressure that is absolutely not true and by the way low sodium in your diet can increase
the risk of insulin resistance in fact we need a good amount of salt especially if you're on keto
and for certain people that have migraine headaches they need to have
a lot more sodium so i will do a separate video on sodium but celery probably has the highest amount
of sodium of all the different vegetables so it's actually not bad at all it's actually really good
when you do keto the insulin in your body is going down and insulin increases the retention of sodium
so you're going to be losing more sodium so just consume more sea salt to offset that
as well as other electrolytes as well like potassium because if you're not consuming
enough potassium it will also increase insulin and affect your blood sugars so there's a huge
connection between potassium and helping normalize your blood sugars you need potassium and sodium
in the correct ratios a lot of times i'll do a video just on sodium or potassium
i should probably do a video just on all the electrolytes together because they all work
together so adding a nut butter to your celery whether it's almond butter or peanut butter or
other nut butters is a really good thing it can be an alternative to your salad it can help your ph
it can reduce your risk for getting gout it will also decrease hunger because of the fat in the nut
butters also celery is great for lowering stress helping you sleep and it can help support healthy
blood pressure levels as well all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing

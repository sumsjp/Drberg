Let's talk about what happens on the inside of your body when you're fasting
so over here we have a start of a fast and we go 24 hours 48 and 72 so there's
a lot of really magical things that happen when you fast our bodies have
developed over a long period of time and have adapted to starvation many many
times so we have all these unique proteins that get expressed or turned on
that have to do with your brain doing better the different parts of your body
is surviving better our bodies have not adapted to the frequency of eating like
we do now like every three hours so right around 12 hours we get this spike
in growth hormone growth hormone is the anti-aging hormone it's the main fat
burning hormone it's the hormone involved with healing joints and it's
involved with protein synthesis or making different new proteins some
people take growth hormone to get injected I don't recommend it but they
take it to help heal certain parts of your body but guess what
fasting will trigger it automatically so just by the fact that you're fasting you
can increase growth hormone and of course exercise will also increase
growth hormone as well so it starts about 12 hours and it increases as you
go on and on now at about 18 hours you start developing something called autophagy
autophagy is an interesting thing that happens with your body where you start
recycling old damaged proteins and microbes as well one type of protein
would be the advanced glycated end products which basically when you
combined glucose with a protein it becomes very sticky so let's say you're
on a high carbohydrate diet and that sugar combines with your own protein in
your body and that starts to glide Kate or just kind of destroy some of the
proteins in your body and then they don't function anymore and they get
sticky and they clog things up well guess what your body will start cleaning
all that up and turning these damaged proteins into new amino acids where your
body can use them amyloid plaquing which occurs in the
brain and other parts of the body is a type of protein that can be cleaned up
with a toffee gene so it's any type of cellular proteins that are not working
anymore in your body autophagy will start cleaning that up and
start to renew the tissue and it starts right about 18 hours and it gets more
and more and more as you start fasting in about 24 hours and a little bit
longer you start to really deplete this glycogen Reserve this storage supply of
glucose in your liver so the more that the liver is depleted with glycogen the
more you're going to be running on ketones as the alternative fuel and if
you have a fatty liver for example your body will start using that fat and
turning that into ketones so your body is finally able to start tapping into
this stored energy and you're running more and more on ketones which is a
superior fuel and because you're running on ketones ketones are an appetite
suppressant so your hunger goes away cravings are gone there are antioxidants
so you're building up your antioxidant reserve they provide more oxygen so your
body is running out more oxygen less co2 then it's more efficient and because
ketones are a much more efficient fuel than glucose the thyroid does not have
to work as hard and you may find that your t3 is a little bit lower but the
thyroid stimulating hormone is normal and all that means is your thyroid is
adapting to this new type of fuel now some other cool things that are
happening right around 24 hours is that your inflammation is dropping
significantly if you wanted to even speed it up more you can add some
vitamin D to that and that will really help you so any type of conditions that
involve inflammatory states like arthritis bursitis autoimmune type
conditions start to improve about 24 hours you start getting more gut healing
because the gut now doesn't have to work so frequently with the gallbladder being
stimulated and the pancreas stimulating its enzymes the gut finally has a chance
to just chill out so if you have this condition called SIBO which there are
microbes in the small and testin and they should normally be in
the large intestine that starts to become corrective you start increasing
stem cell in the gut so your gut starts to heal the heart loves ketones way
better than glucose so you start getting improvement in the cardiovascular
function and as well as the brain function there's something called BDNF
this is a factor that helps make new brain cells so your brain starts to
repair at 24 hours as you keep going on you would think you're going to be
losing muscle protein but that's not really what happens because your body
becomes more efficient and there are certain genes that are sparing proteins
so it's not using muscle protein so the efficiency of fuel is much better plus
with autophagy you're using the old damaged proteins and giving you new
protein so the combination is really good so the amount of nutrition that you
really need to run the body is a lot less because the body just dows down and
it can run on less amount of nutrients so that's a positive thing now the other
thing that happens during autophagy is that you're also cleaning out microbes
and fungus and mold and yeast and to kill off those microbes your body
develops certain oxidants and you also have antioxidants on the flipside so
your body actually makes things like hydrogen peroxide to kill off microbes
but it also in the left side makes its own antioxidants to actually protect the
body against the oxidation so we have this entire balance it's only when we
have lower amounts of antioxidants and higher amount of accidents that we get
this thing called oxidative stress which things start breaking down but when
you're doing fasting you're getting a nice balance of more antioxidants and
your body is starting to heal now when you get to 48 hours you really start to
stimulate the stem cells these are undifferentiated cells in other words
they're cells that don't have a purpose so they can turn into this tissue or
that tissue depending on what the body needs so you start to stimulate the stem
cell and get more healing and more repair more anti-aging
you also get decrease risks of certain types of cancer you get shrinkage of
certain tumors you start making more mitochondria now if you push it and go
up to 72 hours you get even more stimulation of stem cells okay in better
immune function but when you actually get into 72 hours or greater I recommend
you do that as a periodic thing simply because a lot of people going into this
have nutritional deficiencies in there if you jump in too fast you can get a
little bit dizzy you can have some side effects so you want to gradually do this
over a period of time but those are some general things that happen when you're
fasting I recommend doing intermittent fasting on a regular basis okay and
probably a good average pattern of doing this would be doing 18 hours of fasting
with a six-hour window so you would eat and then wait to six hours later and
then eat and then fast for 18 hours this would be a really good pattern to follow
and then you can actually make it more strict over time depending on how you do
then what you can do is periodic prolong fasting to achieve additional health
benefits whether it's for your immune system because you have an autoimmune
problem or you just want to look younger with your skin or you want more brain
cells you want a better heart function better gut function or let's say you
have cancer and you want to improve that because one thing that fasting will do
is it will increase your resistance to stress and even if someone's on
chemotherapy it will actually help the body's resistance against chemicals and
poisons which is quite remarkable make sure you take your minerals during
fasting so I know a lot of people recommend just doing either water fast
you're just drinking water or a dry fast where you're not drinking anything I
recommend doing a water fast with nutrients just because if you are
deficient you can have problems so you want you
minerals you want your B vitamins and you want your salt very important right
around 8 o'clock in the morning you have the spike in cortisol and if cortisol
spikes sometimes that can cause your body to make more glucose and you can
have higher blood sugars and it happens with a lot of people with blood sugar
issues nothing to worry about that will improve over time but if you just add
exercise in the morning that will burn off some of that extra sugar and if
you're fasting it's not coming from your diet it's just coming from your liver
making glucose making a little too much because maybe the cortisol is too high
okay so just wanted to point it out and I have videos on that I put a link down
below it's called a dawn phenomena now if your LDL so called bad cholesterol
which is not really bad low density lipoprotein is increased the reason for
this especially if you're not consuming or any type of significant carbohydrates
and you're doing fasting this is increased from a different reason think
about one of the purposes of LDL it's to deliver cholesterol to different tissues
right well think about all the things that are happening when your body is
fasting you are going through a major healing process and cholesterol is the
raw material for your cell membranes for your brain to make hormones to make
vitamin D to make bile 40% of all the cholesterol in your body is there to
supply the membrane of your cells which is essential to protect the cell and
allow for things to go in and out of the cell so maybe one of the reasons why
your body might need the cholesterol to be transported through this carrier
protein is healing the cellular membranes or it could be that it needs
to have the raw material to make more hormones I would not worry about that if
you are concerned there are various tests that you could do to determine
what's happening to this cholesterol isn't doing damage or not but I would
not worry about it but anyway I wanted to create a video just to kind of show
you what happens to the inside of your body when you're
fasting thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a

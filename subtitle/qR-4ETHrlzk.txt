i want to give you a good tip if you have osteoarthritis now typically osteoarthritis
is different than rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease
and osteoarthritis is supposed to be more of a wear and tear type disease it's not really even a
disease it's just your body's normal compensation for wear and tear now there's inflammation
involved there's a decrease of joint space but if osteoarthritis is not supposed to be an autoimmune
disease then why does it many times affect the finger joints which are not weight-bearing
and that's been the mystery of osteoarthritis well there's a couple points i want to make
about this there's another kind of a sub-category of osteoarthritis it's called nodal generalized
osteoarthritis now the term nodal comes from nodes which are these hardened nodules that are
next to the joints in your fingers and there is data on this that suggests that this condition
has a autoimmune component to it and it's higher in women especially if they're postmenopausal
which indicates more of a metabolic syndrome where there's more inflammation systemically and there's
also some interesting studies relating to higher amount of dysbiosis which is an alteration of your
friendly bacteria with osteoarthritis so here's my tip if you have osteoarthritis you want to support
your gut with cabbage there's an interesting study that demonstrates a positive outcome when you
consume cabbage leaf wraps now cabbage especially in the form of sauerkraut is really good for
your stomach it's good for ulcers it's good for your gi system it seems to be one of the best
vegetables for people that have difficult time consuming vegetables the fiber tends to feed
the microbial which then produce things that are anti-inflammatory and cabbage is a really good
source of gal glutamine which supports leaky gut and on top of that leaky gut and problems
with your gi system are nearly always involved in autoimmune diseases regardless of whether you
have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis start consuming cabbage and see if that can help you so

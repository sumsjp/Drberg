all right i'm back again didn't we just uh meet yesterday well i'm back today for
another presentation today we're going to talk about how to get more rem sleep
normally a person will go through 90-minute cycles of sleep okay between four and six of these cycles
with different levels or stages more deeper levels of sleep that's called
non-rem and then you have a superficial level of sleep which is called
rem now the non-rem sleep which is the deeper delta wave sleep occurs more in the first
half of the sleep and this is where you get body repair you get detoxification you get rejuvenation
you get more growth hormone stimulation but then you have something called rem sleep okay what is
rem sleep rem is the more superficial sleep it's the second half of your sleep and this is where
most people have the problem so most people get the first part of the sleep but they're
not getting that second half they're not getting that full rem sleep what's very interesting about
rem sleep is that the weight patterns or the brain activity is almost identical to when you're awake
but you're actually in this sleep state now you would think if the brain activity is very similar
to being awake and the rem sleep is actually using sometimes even more energy than the awake state
you might wake up from this dream state actually exhausted and feeling like wow i just ran a
marathon well that's because you did your brain in that rem state has actually used more energy which
is pretty wild but here's another interesting thing about the rem stage you actually get more
mental rejuvenation in the rem stage than you do in the non-rem stage so in the non-rem stage
you're getting more physical rejuvenation and the rem stage you're getting more mental
rejuvenations so you wake up feeling more mentally rejuvenated more improved memory better learning
interesting now in the rem stage you're getting low muscle tone you're dreaming i just mentioned
that you're getting a massive stimulation the brain stem that's causing this state and you're
getting a lot of acetylcholine being pumped out that's a neurotransmitter that's causing the state
and you're getting virtually no activation of the serotonin or noradrenaline or adrenaline and in
rem sleep you are more sensitive to temperature so if the temperature is too cold or too hot
that can inhibit that stage so now what does all this mean what can we do with this data
well number one we want to make sure that the muscles around our brain stem are completely
relaxed when we go to sleep i'm going to put a video down below of how to achieve this you can
either do this yourself with a a torture i mean a treatment device like this putting this back
in your neck these two little things right on the back right underneath your your skull and lay back
on a chair and let this device melt those muscles around your brainstem or you can have someone
press into the the point right underneath your neck and i'll put a video link down below to
show you how to do that it's a great way to relax the muscles around the brainstem because if you go
to sleep with all this tension in the upper part of your neck it's going to be very difficult all
right number two you want to get your breathing balanced and i've done videos on this what happens
when you have difficulty sleeping is usually your breathing is off usually your breathing is like
the inhalation is not the same as the exhalation so you want to synchronize
the two you want to breathe in three four or five seconds and breathe out
three four or five seconds make sure that they're equaled up sometimes it'll be three seconds in
three seconds out sometimes it'll be four seconds in four seconds out but you want to just
focus on your breathing that will start to send signals into the brainstem through the
vagus nerve to help you get into this state all right number three you want to adjust your blanket
to make sure your temperature is correct i know with my wife she needs a thicker blanket
i use a thinner blanket sometimes even a sheet all right number four
you want to increase your acetylcholine how do you do that vitamin b1 you can do nutritional yeast
you can do other types of b1 make sure it's natural but take a little b1 before you go to bed
b1 is very important in your sleep cycles especially when you're making acetylcholine
and especially when you've been through a lot of stress b1 counter stress b1 helps you counter
nightmares anytime you have nightmares that means you need more b1 all right number five stress
stress is the biggest barrier to your sleep you're going to find out whatever's behind the stress and
deal with it do something to improve it because the stress is the number one thing that will keep
you out of both rem sleep and the non-rem sleep anyway that's my summary on how to get more rem
sleep thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

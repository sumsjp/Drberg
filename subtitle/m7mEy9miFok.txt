now there's a lot of people that are adding lemon to their tea to get a little boost of vitamin c
which you would think is a good thing but here's the problem with doing that lemon has about 23
milligrams of vitamin c which is a good amount but the vitamin c in lemon is very sensitive to
heat that vitamin c starts breaking down at just 86 degrees fahrenheit which is 30 degrees celsius
and there's significant damage to that vitamin c structure at 140 degree fahrenheit which is 60
degree celsius so it would be much better if you let your tea cool down a little bit before you
added the lemon now also if you're going to add lemon from a jar that you would buy at the store
realize it's pasteurized so it's already been cooked and there's not a lot of natural vitamin c
that comes with that product unless they add vitamin c after the fact but they
usually add some synthetic ascorbic acid which is not the total vitamin c complex
in fact it was the pasteurization of milk back in the early 1900s that was blamed for increasing
infantile scurvy which is a vitamin c deficiency a major one because the pasteurization destroyed
vitamin c in that milk now the other really cool thing about preserving vitamin c
is that vitamin c and citric acid which is in that lemon has the ability to preserve
this phytonutrient that's in the tea by 5x so the phytonutrient that plant-based chemical
called catechins which is responsible for a lot of health benefits now you may have heard about
this when associating this with green tea because sometimes in the back of label when
you read green tea it'll have e-g-c-g this is just one type but it's responsible for a lot of
health benefits when you're trying to get these phytonutrients from the tea your own digestion
destroys about 80 percent of this but the citric acid and the vitamin c in the lemon will help you
retain the phytonutrients so it's not destroyed also vitamin b1 and vitamin b5 are also very heat
sensitive so this is just another side note to encourage some raw foods with your cooked foods
all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you

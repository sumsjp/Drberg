let's talk about some interesting benefits of using green tea both topically
and drinking it for your skin i've done other videos on what it can do for your cancer
but there are some real interesting things that can help you with your skin i'm talking about
the polyphenols okay these are phytonutrients number one anti-photo aging what does that mean
it means reducing the aging effect on your skin from uv light from the sun so number one it can
protect you from the radiation from sun to prevent the aging of your skin number two it
can increase collagen and elastin fibers yeah by suppressing enzymes that are degrading collagen
because the chemicals in green tea help suppress the enzymes that degrade break down collagen and
elastin so that's pretty cool number three it's loaded with anti-inflammatory properties number
four and this is cool it can induce autophagy we know fasting induces autophagy but green tea will
also trigger autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged proteins into new proteins that's what
makes your skin look youthful all right number five it can actually promote enzymes to help
clean up free radicals that can damage your dna anything that can reduce the free radicals on your
dna is going to be very beneficial for protecting your skin it can also decrease hydrogen peroxide
too that your body is generating number six it's a potent stress mediator what is a stress mediator
well that has a biological definition okay there's different definitions of mediator which in the
thumbnail sketch will just help you resist stress number seven has the potential for decreasing the
risk to cancer of your skin both melanoma type cancer and non-melanoma type cancer so
drink more green tea especially when you're doing fasting because fasting also has very similar
properties hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

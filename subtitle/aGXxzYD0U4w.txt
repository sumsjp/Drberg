hi guys i'm back for another video an important video and we're going to teach you how to break
this terrible habit of snacking you may find this hard to believe but some people actually
snack not out of hunger but out of a habit i know it's hard to believe but some people do that what
you have to realize is every time you eat you increase insulin and the single most important
thing you can do for your health is to keep your insulin normalized so we want to do intermittent
fasting not because of calories but because when you decrease the frequency and you eat less
your body does a lot better on many different levels so that's the goal it takes about three
days on average to adapt to fat burning to adapt to making ketones and so we always suggest you
add more fat to the meal so you can go longer very important because if you do this with low fat it's
more difficult you're not going to be satisfied so that will at least get rid of the cravings
in hunger but now what do we do about this habit of eating we have to be chewing on something all
the time when you're doing intermittent fasting and you eat a meal if your carbs are too high
you will crave carbs the next day you will be more hungry the next day when you're trying to fast
so make sure your carbs are low second important point eating too late at night will increase
hunger the next morning so try to make that last meal um no longer than seven o'clock
and let's say you go to bed at 10 then you're good because you have some hours to fast
and then all night long and then you wake up and you're not even going to be hungry now let
me get into what i really wanted to talk to you about and that is the two ways to handle the body
there's two ways there's the right way and there's the wrong way let's talk about the wrong way first
this is the worst question you can ask your body hmm what am i in the mood for tonight what do i
want to eat that is really really bad because your body is going to usually always give you the wrong
answer it's going to give you some junk food and so the body just does not have the intelligence to
have judgment and so if you had some pleasure with some carbohydrate a year ago your body might want
to have that carbohydrate again regardless of if it's healthy or not the right way to address the
body is this no we're not going to eat we're fasting i will feed you when it's time so we
really have to rise up above this habit and be in charge over the body so the body's been dictating
what to eat for the last several decades so it's time that you start telling the body exactly
what's going down and when it can eat and what'll happen is something very interesting you're gonna
find that that impulse completely goes away and you're no longer hungry and you're not craving
and it's easy just start being in charge and you'll see you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

let's talk about seven ways to improve your bone health now your peak bone density occurs in your
late 20s personally i'm right at this point where i have the peak bone density unfortunately it's
all downhill from here but as you start getting older you start losing the density of your bone
and your bones become softer and softer and softer especially for women after menopause because they
get this huge drop in estrogen and if you're going through menopause and you have a problem with
the precursor for osteoporosis which is osteopenia i would recommend taking something called dhea to
help increase the precursor for these various hormones including estrogen and i would really
only take between 10 to 15 milligrams not too much because it can also increase testosterone
and we don't want to do that we just want to make the precursor for estrogen there
in case your body needs it to make a little bit more all right so the first thing to improve
your bones is to start taking vitamin d3 i would recommend taking 10 000 iu's every single day
now if you have a major situation with osteoporosis i would take more i'd probably take
20 to 30 000 ius of vitamin d3 and then number two with that vitamin d3 you're also going to need
k2 k2 is very very important in bone k2 works with vitamin d3 so vitamin d3 increases the absorption
of calcium in the blood but k2 takes that calcium and derives it right into the
bone if there's not enough vitamin k2 then calcium can tend to settle in the arteries
as well in the joints now as far as the amount of k2 i would use that as the ratio with d3 so if d3
is 10 000 i use i would take a 100 micrograms of k2 and the type of k2 i would take is the
mk7 version not the mk4 the mk7 so if you're going to take 20 000 ius of d3 you would take
200 micrograms of k2 make sense okay number three i would take some organic grass-fed dairy probably
some cheese to get your calcium that's one of the best sources of calcium all right number four
increase your vegetables to get vitamin c vitamin c has everything to do with collagen and there's
collagen in bone there's collagen in connective tissue that surrounds bone there's collagen in
your joints and so bone is not just about minerals it's about protein and vitamin c
and other minerals in the vegetables will help your bone also the dark leafy greens are loaded
with calcium all right number five weight-bearing exercise is a vitally important you're going to
add stress to the bone and your bone's going to actually adapt and get stronger from that
stress all right next one is trace minerals very very important especially copper manganese zinc
all are needed for enzymes in certain proteins that help build bone and number seven one of the
trace minerals boron is really needed to just to make the bone stronger so you might want to take
that as an extra thing all right there you have it the seven ways to improve bone health so if

i want to give you six exercises for a double chin now as we age or gain weight
a lot of times we get a little loose skin underneath here and it can develop into a
double chin so with anyone that has a double chin i would highly recommend you start with
healthy keto and intermittent fasting because that's going to actually help
you take the weight off and then in addition to that start doing these exercises you can find

recommend something called the straight jaw jut exercise okay that would be something you can do
number two the ball exercise you can try that
number three the exercise called pucker
up
number four tongue stretch number five the neck stretch
number six the exercise called bottom jaw jut so you can go ahead and pause this video and practice
these exercises uh personally i'm not going to demonstrate these for you you can just watch the
video so go ahead and try these a few times a day over the next couple weeks and then comment down

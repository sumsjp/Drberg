hi guys in this video we're going to talk about metformin which is marketed
as glucophage okay this medication is normally for diabetes type 2 and PCOS
polycystic ovarian syndrome and it basically does two things it helps
increase sensitivity to insulin so it's it improves insulin resistance as well
as the suppression of glucose production from the liver okay because if your
livers making too much glucose it's gonna raise the sugar so metformin will
chill that out and increase the sensitivity so here's the hormone
insulin here's this receptor it comes in it makes the connection and there's
resistance it allows the insulin to work better in the cell okay well that sounds
great but two things one is the actual root cause is rarely addressed like the
high levels of sugar in the diet are rarely addressed the frequent eating is
rarely addressed if that was addressed you could eventually improve it without
metformin so one of the challenges with metformin is that it not only has side
effects diarrhea nausea abdominal pain gas but it has a boxed warning which is
a very severe warning based on the FDA that will spike lactic acid okay
which can then severely affect your pH and create a lot of more serious
problems also it blocks the absorption of b12 and folic acid so that has a
whole series of side effects connected to that and in addition to that you
don't want to take metformin and if you have a liver problem or a kidney problem
but who doesn't have a liver problem or a kidney problem if they're pre-diabetic
in the first place so it does come with a package so there
are some natural alternatives that you can use in addition to metformin and by
the way check with your doctor before taking this recommendation okay but you
can research a berberine which is helps improve insulin resistance okay cinnamon
goat's rue green tea bitter melon all of these improve insulin resistance so it's
something to do research on as a way to possibly avoid these side effects
alright thanks for watching hey guys I want to personally invite you to a new
Facebook group that I just started called dr. Berg's keto and intermittent
fasting lab ok so I created this so we can share our successful actions what
worked what didn't work the results so I put a link down below so go ahead and
sign up and I'll see you inside

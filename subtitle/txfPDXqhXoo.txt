so today's topic is going to be on high cholesterol
on keto so many people sometimes freak out because their cholesterol is too
high i've done quite a few videos on this but
i wanted to create a video on something very specific that you need
to know about so here's the big point
a good amount of your cholesterol and by the way
there's two organs in your body that make cholesterol
one is the liver but also the intestines so a good majority of your cholesterol
is controlled by bile salts
okay so bile salts are made by the liver
and the intestine
all right so we've got the liver and the intestine
and excess cholesterol
is eliminated through various pathways involving bile so you need bile
to eliminate excess cholesterol and the regulation of excess cholesterol
is dependent on bile now as far as the small
intestine goes there's these little receptors
and they're called bile acid receptors another name for
a bile acid receptor would be an fxr receptor not that you need to know that
now what these receptors do is they regulate
cholesterol by suppressing cholesterol
now the liver also influences cholesterol
as well but not as much as a small intestine
the small intestine really regulates hdl the so-called good cholesterol well
it's not good or bad it's the cholesterol from the cell back
to the liver so look at this right here we've got hdl
goes from the cell back to the liver and then ldl goes from
the liver to the cell so they're just
transportation proteins as in high density lipoprotein
or low density lipo protein all right so far so good let's go on to
the next slide there's another condition called
cholesterol
anemia okay now essential means they don't know what causes it
very similar to essential high blood pressure they don't they don't really
know what causes it we know it's usually vitamin d and low
potassium but essential hyper cholesterol anemia includes
familial hyper cholesterol anemia and this is that condition which is
genetic okay which people are concerned about because
they don't really think they can do anything about it but you can do things
about it and i will put a link down below
so that's just one part there's other causes of this
unknown high cholesterol a high fat diet okay but if you have high cholesterol
it'd be a very good idea to get some advanced lipid testing to
really find out more what's going on you're going to find out
the type of high ldl that you have is actually a good ldl but i don't want
to get into that right now i want to kind of stay on track
so we have genetics high fat diet because you're doing keto
but also hypothyroidism that can cause high cholesterol in the
blood also kidney damage
and a deficiency in bile okay now that can be from some
obstruction from a kidney stone or and that's what i really want to talk
about right now
so what causes a deficiency in bile because
bile is very very important in breaking down fats to absorb fat cyber vitamins
it helps lubricate the colon it helps prevent
sibo in the small intestine but it also has a very important function
in regulating cholesterol okay so what would cause a deficiency in bile
main thing is liver damage
okay as in a fatty liver an inflamed liver as in hepatitis
or a liver that's filled with fibrotic tissue
or a liver that has scar tissue which is called cirrhosis
okay so all three of those conditions will cause a deficiency in bile because
anything that decreases the liver function decreases the amount of bile
production but you also have the small intestine
and that would be the next thing i will mention if you have intestinal damage
okay so let's say you had a series of antibiotics that just destroyed your
intestine or let's say you have celiac or crohn's or diverticulitis
any inflammation or damage in your small intestine
will decrease the production of bile and that
can spike the cholesterol now because your friendly bacteria the
microbiome also help to recycle bile
if there's a problem in the microbiome you're not going to make enough bile so
the good bacteria could be another thing to look at or
it could be that you had the gallbladder removed you have no
gallbladder in which case you're going to have
less bile so all of these are factors that can contribute to high cholesterol
i just wanted to bring up your awareness and another
link to high cholesterol that you need to be aware of
because a solution a very simple solution
would be if you had liver damage is just to take some purified bile salts
okay and that is going to help regulate cholesterol now
it also could be that you need to take more good bacteria
okay so that's another solution right there or it could be that you have a
slow thyroid so the point is that in order to fix something you have to know
all the potential causes and then what's the most likely cause
all right thanks for watching and tell me what you think of this new format i'm
just trying it out
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto absolutely not karen

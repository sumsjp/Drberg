today i'd like to discuss one second
geez
today i'm going to talk about the best
homemade cough syrup and sore throat
soother
i'm sorry i just like demonstrating
various symptoms when i talk about them
sometimes people don't get my dry sense
of humor when i'm trying to be
funny all right this video is on
coughing and a sore throat one of the
best remedies now it does involve honey
in other videos i've always talked about
honey and how it can affect your blood
sugars but in this circumstances if you
have a cough especially a chronic cough
or a sore throat
i changed my viewpoint on that i'm going
to tell you why in a minute if it's a
very specific type of honey but this
remedy involves a certain type of honey
which i'll explain
lemon
apple cider vinegar
and water and the active ingredient that
has most the benefits is manuka honey
okay this is a very specific type of
honey that has some very interesting
effects uh very interesting research
and a lot of natural chemicals that
create all sorts of effects so even
though
it is a sugar it's 70
fructose and 30
glucose okay it can affect your blood
sugars it has a lot of other things in
it that can actually help you for
various things which i'm going to go
through there's some massive research on
this type of honey i'm going to put all
the links down below but in one study it
worked better than an antibiotic and
certain medications for coughing
and so just to clarify
it's not the fructose or the glucose
that's creating the positive effect it's
all the other amazing chemicals that
these little bees go out and extract
from flowers and bring back to the
beehive specifically the manuka bush
which has some amazing amazing
phytochemicals manuka honey has been
shown to decrease the symptom of a sore
throat
it has positive benefits for burns all
types of burns it's great for wound
healing
as well as ulcers like in bed sores in
fact it's an approved fda treatment for
both wound healing and bed source
apparently some of these natural
chemicals in honey release oxygen from
your hemoglobin and speed up the healing
process it has anti-allergy effects
anti-inflammatory effects it can inhibit
an upper respiratory tract infection it
has anti-thrombotic effects which help
reduce clotting
it has major beneficial immune effects
it also inhibits a strep bacterial
infection
as well as showing positive benefits for
gingivitis and periodontal disease
even though it's a sugar it does not
cause cavity in fact it can reduce
plaquing and again i'm not recommending
this as part of your diet because it has
a lot of sugar in it but for coughs and
a sore throat you might want to try this
so this is simply how to make it you get
a mason jar okay with a lid
and you add two tablespoons of apple
cider vinegar why
well
apple cider vinegar increases
phagocytosis it can help speed up the
immune process and get you through this
infection a little bit faster also apple
cider vinegar is anti-microbial
all right
second thing is you're going to add two
tablespoons of lemon juice
if you have the time i would prefer
if you took one whole lemon make sure
it's organic and blend the whole lemon
as a part of your lemon instead of the
lemon juice why
because there's going to be a lot more
vitamin c if you have this raw blended
lemon mixture
in this concoction but if you don't have
time for that and you want more
convenience just use two tablespoons of
lemon juice preferably organic
now lemon juice has some some really
amazing properties too um it can act as
a natural antibiotic it has
antimicrobial properties it can also
suppress a cough all right the third
thing you're gonna add is two
tablespoons of manuka
honey then you're gonna add eight ounces
of water you'll shake it up
keep it in the refrigerator okay
and i would recommend taking it as a
shot get a shot glass take a shot at a
time
slug it down let it like permeate your
throat and swallow it and you can do
that several times a day now i don't
recommend boiling this because we're
dealing with enzymes and certain
chemicals that can be affected with heat
however
another thing you could do that works
pretty good
is make some slippery elm bark tea
okay and then you can let it cool down a
little bit add the honey to it like one
tablespoon okay you can melt it into the
mixture and you can sip that as a tea
just don't add the honey when it's
really really hot and as one additional
point if you're going to blend the lemon
instead of using the lemon juice
what i would do is i would mix
everything together
okay the water the honey the apple cider
vinegar and the glass of water
and blend that as one unit okay and then
you can keep it in the fridge now it's
going to be pretty
strong it's going to be pretty potent so
when you slug this down
it might initially kind of irritate your
throat because of the apple cider
vinegar so if that's the case then you
can add more water but for most people
it seems to suppress the cough
now if you haven't seen my other video
on lemon water that's a really good one
i'll put it up right here check it out

so the highest zinc food in the world is oysters that's number one oysters are
loaded with zinc and the type of zinc that's bile available
then we get red meat okay then we get fish and the list goes down from there
there is a small amount of zinc in pumpkin seeds for example
and there are a few other things but here's the problem with zinc
there is no storage system in our body for
zinc so if we're not getting it from the diet we are going to be
deficient 25 of the planet is deficient in zinc
and it's very difficult to determine if you're deficient
other than symptoms because when you do a blood test it's not detectable
even though you're very deficient it's only detectable
after a long-term deficiency or a severe depletion but let's talk about the
consequence of not having enough zinc in the body
first of all you're going to have decreased amount of lymphocytes
it's your white blood cells so you're going to have a hard time fighting off
infection and pathogens if it's very severe you
may get in a large spleen get a decreased response to
pathogens so not only do you have decreased numbers
of white blood cells but your response to pathogens is
sluggish so you can't fight infection as well as you did when you had enough
zinc the thymus the training camp for the white blood
cells gets smaller next one is increased
susceptibility to an infection so you're more susceptible
to getting sick so whereas one person would not necessarily get the infection
you might get it next one is loss of taste and smell next
one is decrease wound healing and
decrease testosterone and because zinc is an anti-inflammatory you lose your
ability to get rid of inflammation so you have more
inflammation there are a couple other reasons why people
are deficient in zinc a big one is phytates
phytates are in fiber they're in whole grains
so when you consume flour products breads
pasta cereal crackers rice alone with phytates it's in the bran
it's a fiber and phytates block zinc okay so that's
number one number two stress will deplete your
zinc high levels of cortisol over a period of time
will deplete your zinc sugar as in not just sugar but high fructose
corn syrup and honey and all the other types of
sweeteners also coming right down here diabetes which
is a condition where you have high sugar will also deplete
zinc so these two are very similar the longer you have an infection the less
zinc you're going to have in your body and you need zinc
for these things right here and acids will deplete you of zinc you need
an acidic stomach to absorb zinc so as you get
older you lose the stomach acid you can no longer pull zinc in
like you did before malabsorption if you have
gut damage you're going to have a hard time absorbing zinc
if you have liver damage even a fatty liver
even in a liver that's inflamed even a liver
that has scar tissue you're not going to be able to absorb
zinc and so many people have a fatty liver and they don't even know it
if you're a vegan it's going to be a lot more difficult to get
zinc because you're consuming things that are pulling it out
and you're not consuming animal products so you're not going to get the
bio-available zinc that you need so anyway i just want to increase the
awareness of zinc and the importance of getting enough zinc
in your diet hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no
sugar totally keto there's no suffering in

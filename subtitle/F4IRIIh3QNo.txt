now we're going to show you how to do
the stretch with this massage tool okay
the if you notice there's different
widths you have a long width here medium
and a short one right here and it's
designed for my my hand here and I had
it made um in China so what we're going
to do is we're going to first take this
one right here and hold that okay and
she's going to press up underneath there
and stretch back okay she's going to do
that three times and she's pressing in
in a slightly
up she's right underneath the clavicle
and she's lifting that thing
up and it's creating a lot of space good
now let's use the bigger
width okay it's a little bit more
outer
good good right
there good do that three
times okay good now let's say for
example her left shoulder was tight
or restricted or she had more tension on
the right side then what she can do is
take this and bring it out a little bit
more and then go back yeah so in other
words we can just we can really stretch
because the clavicle the collar bone
goes from here all the way to the
shoulder right here okay it's funny
because I um at home I have one of these
by my bed side and I use this thing
every single night in fact last night my
wife was like come on give me a massage
I'm like I'm not done yet with my
massage so I spend like five minutes
every night with this thing right here
so we'll show you some other techniques
as well so that's how you do the collar
bone stretch with the massage tool

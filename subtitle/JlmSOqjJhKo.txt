hello dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about instrumented fasting and discipline so
the first thing I'm going to say is for those of you they're already doing this I'm going to
say you are amazing because it's not easy to go 18 hours or you know 20 hours without eating it takes
a tremendous amount of discipline so well done on that but those of you that are not doing that I
want to try to talk you into it because there's some really cool benefits my message has always
been you have the power over food your body your health okay but what do most people do it's the
opposite the food is controlling them I was in the airport last night I was watching people in line
at the Cinnabon little place they had there there wasn't a lot of people in line that looked healthy
there wasn't any slim people there was a lot of overweight people in that line and basically the
food manufacturing companies are really smart in that they prey on people's emotions that the
sensation of that food it's all short-term they don't think tomorrow they're thinking right now
just going there eating that Cinnabon so people live for the sensation of food their whole life
is wrapped around this sensation it comes with a package okay I'm not talking about the sensation
of health foods talk about the sensation of junk foods the food manufacturing companies
have inserted many chemicals in those foods that keep you highly addictive so what's happening
is they're being controlled by this blood sugar trap it's like the sugar it goes down now they're
hungry they go eat it goes up they get tired goes down they eat it and this it's just it's literally
a trap so in intermittent fasting it's an exercise in self-discipline now we get to intermittent
fasting most people are doing it with fairly healthy suits so I'm not talking about doing the
Cinnabon within intermittent fasting but intermittent fasting is an exercise in self-deploying you
think about it it has so many benefits physically like increasing growth hormone by 2,000 percent
we growing nerve cells so your cognitive function is amazing high levels of ketosis where your body
is so level you're out of the blood sugar issues now now you have this incredible energy that's
very sustaining improving your memory improving inflammation improving and cardiovascular function
I mean it goes it's amazing but beyond the health there's also a personal increasing your personal
power your personal willpower because you're actually putting discipline when you're not
eating for a period of time despite all this temptation it really improves your personal
willpower which is actually almost equivalent to the body improvement so I want you to look
beyond the short-term pleasure of it and look at the long-term benefits on a physical and emotional
level of intermittent fasting because I think you'll love it there is some uncomfortableness
in the first two weeks because you're adapting to it but you can do it on such a nice gradual
increase that it's not that hard but you have to just be really conscious of what you're doing and
not randomly just kind of eat what you want okay so you start with three meals a day do that for
your period of time without snacks then graduate to you know eating later and later and later the
breakfast until the point where you're having no breakfast all you're just doing a lunch and
a dinner two meals so I put a link down below of how to do this so the next step is just to
start well as of today I'm just under 60 pounds total ah since yeah since and so for the women
out there you guys I was killing a size 18 women and now I'm in a loose size 10 wow that's fantastic
you basically have a six pack AB right now right oh yeah absolutely I never I never really had
six pack abs let's just say even when I was 170 pounds soccer weight I didn't really it wasn't
defined let's just say in terms of that you can kind of see the outside that you never could see
the inside now you can definitely see the whole thing especially if I like flex a little bit
that's very prominent and you know that definitely feels good I'm proud that I'll have to worry about
wearing a swim shirt when I go with my kids to the pool or something which I would when I was
one 80 pounds 100 pounds of elbow embarrassed in that way but besides just looking better I just
feel a hundred percent better yeah it's hard to tell how you feel really when you 180 pounds you
know you don't feel good but if I could compare somehow get the feeling trapped in a bottle for
both feelings at the same time it's so much better now than it right so I thought let me give my body
a chance to adapt more than two or three months I did my blood test again and my cluster was at
the normal range I was so happy you know like I sorry doctor like you I have two members of my
family you know one died of a heart stroke and one is the disabled through the neck down just
because of heart disease and I didn't want to take that to it because I'm going to take start taking
tablets I'm going to start it oh it's going to open for me other doors like other medications
are and but no I don't want to do that I wanted to go into ketosis and I got committed and people saw
my results hey if you haven't already subscribed press this little button down below okay thanks

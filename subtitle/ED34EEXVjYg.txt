let's cover the 10 reasons why you might
be exhausted and i have a lot of
personal experience i was being
exhausted a good portion of my life and
i had no idea back then
but i'm going to share some of my
experiences with you in this video
the first and most important thing to do
when you have exhaustion is just to
you know kind of go back in your mind
and isolate when it started and then
take a look at what happened just before
that to get a clue was it diet related
was it stress related was there some
medication you got on and then then
you'll know okay the real simple thing
that very few people do actually but
let's take it from the top number one
medications have side effects there are
so many people out there right now on
medications that are tired that are not
connecting the dots in fact i don't even
know of one medication that doesn't give
you fatigue
or lethargy
or
some type of lowered energy as a side
effect okay they all
cause you to be tired because they
inhibit or stimulate um
neurotransmitters which are kind of like
hormone little communications in your
nervous system so especially if you're
in antidepressants or anti-anxiety
medication or high blood pressure
medication
those definitely will make you
tired so find another solution i'm not
telling you to come off your medication
but get with your doctor and see if you
can
do something more natural because if
you're trying to fix one problem and it
gives you another problem
it's not worth it so
number two
fuel the fuel that you're running your
body on is the wrong fuel you're running
your body on sugar this applies to
those that are new to my channel if
you're not new
you already know this but
burning fat fuel gives you a lot of
energy burning sugar fuel will make you
roller coaster with your energy and that
was me in my 20s
i was so exhausted i had no connection
it was related to my diet as i was
eating cereal and muffins and
orange juice in the morning
avoiding the saturated fat
pure carbs
and i had no connection i would in fact
my wife
and i would be driving the street and
we'd see a
health food store honey let's go in
there and take some vitamins and come
out with all these vitamins
in hopes of raising or boosting my
energy well that never worked until i
finally stumbled across a book called
it's called mastering the zone
and in the first chapter i was talking
about
insulin and
carbohydrates and i'm like why did i
miss this in
college
and i started to consume
more protein eggs and i'd cut down the
carbs and oh my gosh did my energy come
back
fast
and then i got really interested in the
subject and
doing massive deep dive in research and
here i am
okay and if you want that information
what to eat i put the link down below
number three
poor sleep
that's a that's a big one if you are not
sleeping through the night if you are
not feeling rejuvenated when you get up
then it could be
your stress level it could be something
you're missing there's a lot of reasons
i have probably at least 50 videos on
sleep i'll put one of the best ones down
below
but if you're low in vitamin d and low
in zinc
that right there will keep you from
sleeping and one little quick tip if you
take vitamin d3 and zinc right before
bed you may find that you sleep a lot
better right off the bat
of course you want to change your diet
as well
all right number four hidden infection
this happened with me
in high school i had mono okay that's
epstein-barr virus
and so i had this infection it was
really bad my tonsils were completely
swollen and then later in life when i
went through a lot of stress
i had chronic fatigue syndrome and
fibromyalgia
that was that epstein-barr virus sitting
in the background
being reactivated okay being reactivated
by a stress state
so these viruses tend to go dormant and
then come out later in life not as a
full-blown infection
but as fatigue or achy joints or
flu-like symptoms
what happened with me is i really dealt
with
a major stress in my life at that time
and ridding the stress
caused that virus to go back on emission
because stress
activates cortisol cortisol
paralyzes
your immune cells your white blood cells
so cortisol will just shut down your
immune system the pathogens come out and
create
a lot of problems so
you have to handle this thing right here
to handle this
another time in my life i got lines i i
remember getting really tired just out
of the blue for no reason like why am i
so exhausted and then i looked in the
mirror in my back and there's a bullseye
rash i'm like oh okay
so i started to take the antibiotic and
boy i did not feel good on that
it felt like my body was like the inside
was a wash machine
it's like something is just not good so
i stopped that and i started taking um
a series of herbal things and i'll put
the link down below of what i took
and that took care of those
symptoms and i got my energy back and i
to this day i never had a problem with
that
okay number five post covid
uh fatigue
um
a lot of people are complaining about
this i did a video on it what you need
is a lot of vitamin b1 because
this infection depletes your b1 and one
of the big side effects
is a lack of energy because your little
energy factories your mitochondria need
b1 to create energy so you need a lot of
b1 i wouldn't take the synthetic version
i would take a natural version and you
will find that your energy goes up
people that have gastric bypass surgery
they're usually low in b1 and they get
fatigue people that drink a lot of
coffee and tea through the day
are b1 deficient and then that can cause
fatigue and then the need for more
caffeine
all right number six
if you tried the ketogenic diet and you
get keto fatigue that's merely
that you're missing either electrolytes
specifically potassium
or b vitamins
the best source of b vitamins is
nutritional yeast unfortified and of
course the best electrolytes are of
course my own brand and of course i'm
not biased
but here's the thing
with potassium every single cell has
this little
these little pumps are called sodium
potassium pumps okay and what they do is
they generate energy for the nervous
system and the muscular system
so you need a lot of potassium to run
that system because if you're deficient
and especially if you add keto on top of
it the demand for these nutrients does
go up
which i'm not going to get into the why
but
just add these two things in here and
your fatigue will go away all right
number seven you can have anemia and
take a while guess what food has really
good amounts of b12 and iron red meat
that's right red meat so taking these
two vitamins doesn't always work just
simply because they might not be
bioavailable right so
if you switched over to a plant-based
diet or a vegan diet and you start
getting anemia
maybe that wasn't the best solution in
the world
but so many people have this subclinical
anemia the other reason for anemia is
that maybe you are getting these two
nutrients but the stomach acid is not
strong enough
and so
what you need is betaine hydrochloride
okay simple remedy you take five betaine
hydrochloride before you eat and you
start acidifying the stomach now how do
you know if you need more stomach acid a
really good clue would be indigestion
acid reflux that's right and if you have
those two symptoms or bloating
just try some betaine hydrochloride and
those symptoms will go away
because you might think that wow i need
to suppress the acid right no you need
to increase the acid so
if you
are on or were on
an acid okay
that could be causing you anemia because
it depletes the acid in your stomach so
that's another mechanism of why people
are tired
number eight low thyroid can definitely
make you tired it could mean that you
just need a little bit of iodine or
selenium but
most hypothyroid situations are
autoimmune that's number 10
where you have a lot of inflammation and
that can be causing the fatigue the
remedy for a hashimoto's type thyroid
problem and
all other autoimmune diseases have to do
with taking more vitamin d3 and you want
to take no less than about
30 000 ius per day okay that is going to
help reduce the inflammation
and
increase your energy
i want to mention number nine
mycoplasmas what is that that is uh some
stealth microbe that is very small
bacteria that can hide in little calcium
igloos they're called biofilms this can
occur for example i know like in like
the gulf war syndrome
this is really underneath that and so if
you have these
hidden infections
like oregano oil works good any of the
natural herbs like garlic thyme
sage and there's a whole list of them
you can do as a natural way of
suppressing this as well as dealing with
this the stress here because these guys
can kind of come out when your cortisol
is too
high
all right i gave you a lot of
information i hope i didn't overwhelm
you but i think the most important thing
to do now would be to implement a basic
eating plan that's correct
and that's why i put this video up right
here check it out

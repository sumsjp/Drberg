so i'm scrolling through my youtube videos and someone made this comment my mom is
really skinny and she eats sugar so what's up with that so let's do a video on that topic
being overweight is only one of the effects of consuming sugar and refined carbohydrates there's
something called skinny fat and there's two different terms that describe skinny fat one is
tofi which stands for thin on the outside fat on the inside many people who are skinny yet they're
consuming a lot of sugar have a fatty liver unless you do an ultrasound you're not going to
necessarily pick it up it doesn't always show up in a large gut it might be a smaller little pooch
then you have another condition called m-o-n-w metabolically obese but with the normal weight
okay a really important test to really pick this up if someone's consuming sugar
is to have them do an a1c test which would measure the average amount of sugar over a
period of three months and it should really be below 5.5 ish but a lot of times it'll be like
7 8 9 10 11 and that just tells you the person is going right into diabetes if not already there
another test is the cac test coronary artery calcification test it's a very quick test very
important it is one of the best tests to predict mortality from all causes and it picks up how much
calcium is clogging up the coronary artery on your heart which is a direct effect of consuming sugar
and then homa ir this is a insulin resistance test very few doctors even know about it
but this would actually pick up insulin resistance and also if you're going right into diabetes
eventually it could take some time diabetes takes maybe 15 20 even 30 years before it develops so
you start here and then you end up years later with this situation so it might not show up
on the outside but your liver starts to becoming fatty inflamed and eventually cirrhosis it affects
the brain there's studies that show it starts to affect dementia forgetfulness cognitive problems
also clots clogged arteries of the heart the eyes cataracts glaucoma
loss of vision macular degeneration and kidney problems they start developing high blood pressure
uh things like that and there are actually 3 million skinny diabetics in the usa so
just because someone is skinny doesn't mean they're healthy thanks for watching

so now out of all the herbs that are out there which one has the most antioxidants now and out
of all the categories of different types of foods herbs are at the top of the list as far as giving
you the most antioxidants and antioxidants are additional health benefits to the vitamins and the
minerals and the other nutrients that are in food and this would also include the phytonutrients
because antioxidants are not just about getting rid of free radical damage they give you a lot
of other amazing health benefits now there's two lists here this list right here is kind of like
fresh herbs this is more powdered so basically i'm going to cover both lists because
oregano has the most antioxidants but if you're getting a powdered herb
clove has the most antioxidants so really depends on some other factors but we're just going to look
at oregano and then we'll just talk about clove as well now oregano is amazing because it's a
very very powerful anti-microbial herb that you can take for all sorts of like hidden infections
that you might have so people take it if they have chronic fatigue syndrome epstein-barr virus
if they have some fungus or some type of yeast infection or candida or even something called sibo
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth but oregano has amazing properties as an antimicrobial
as well as many other ones now sage is very good for a condition where you're sweating for no
reason sage should be a good herb to take because it supports the parasympathetic nervous system
and inhibits the sympathetic nervous system which is like the flight or fight so it has
a very unique action next one is peppermint peppermint is very easy to grow it's like a weed
but it actually is good for your digestive system so people take peppermint to help bloating and to
help increase the bile release from your liver and you can definitely do it in a tea as well
especially after you eat thyme is an herb that is antimicrobial a lot of times people take time and
clove together because they're antimicrobial in fact they take thyme clove and oregano for any
type of bacterial or viral infection that's going on so that's what time is and let me just kind
of bounce right to clove clove is good to put on you know a tooth that is in pain or even abscess
in your in your mouth put it right over there because it has a numbing agent
it's very powerful anti-microbial and specifically it has very powerful anti-parasitic actions
so it's good for parasites all right then we have allspice this is a good
good thing to take if you're in pain or you have inflammation it tastes like a combination of three
things nutmeg cinnamon and clove all together and then we have cinnamon right here cinnamon is
good for a lot of things but especially blood sugars if someone has a blood sugar issue
cinnamon can help them greatly lemon balm that's very very good at calming the nervous system
helping you sleep reducing stress rosemary is as an oil you can put it topically on your scalp to
stimulate hair growth very effective it's also a powerful antibacterial all right so i just
wanted to give you a little bit of data on the amazing powerful effects that phytonutrients and
antioxidants can give you which are in addition to the vitamins and minerals and trace minerals
that you have in our food supply hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

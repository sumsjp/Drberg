so let's talk about coffee substitutes you know some people don't want to
consume all this caffeine because it triggers the adrenal and it definitely
can affect your sleep and your weight loss and a lot of other things so when
you consume decaf you have to realize that 97% of it's decaffeinated there's
that 3% cap being so it's not 100% and it does go stale twice as fast as
regular coffee so when you buy it off the shelf make sure you read the label
to make sure it's not too old and the last thing is you want to consume water
processed or Swiss water process you do not want to consume the regular method
because there are certain chemicals in there and it's just not not good I would
also get an organic decaf versus just a commercial decaf so then let's talk
about teeccino - teeccino is amazing because there's no caffeine it tastes
very similar to coffee it's made from chicory root carob barley
nuts in cocoa so it only has 4 grams of carbohydrate per serving and only one
gram of sugar so it's totally fine and you'd be surprised how close it is to
coffee then we have Roma which is a roasted barley and chicory and has rye
in there very similar to teeccino slightly different no caffeine two grams of
carbohydrate one gram of sugar so that's another great substitute so either one
of these three are totally fine if you wanted to avoid caffeine thanks for

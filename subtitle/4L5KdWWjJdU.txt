hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about ketosis acne and other skin issues
hands down ketosis is the absolute best thing to do for your acne and other skin issues like
examine psoriasis and dermatitis okay let's talk about why well first of all usually acne is a
high androgen situation that's a male hormone women have it not as much but men have more
but antigens increase the oil the skin and also they can create acne if it's too high alright
but the question is why is your antigens too high especially as a teenager well it's simply because
teenagers consume more junk food especially sugar because insulin is really the trigger
that makes too much androgen that's why I like in this condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome
that's women PCOS or pcod the situation where you have multiple cysts on the ovaries they have more
androgen issues they have high energon facial hair hair loss weight gain acne less because of insulin
resistance or too much insulin okay so insulin is the culprit cortisol which is a stress hormone
could also increase insulin which can then lead to increased androgen so some people get acne or
skin issues when they go through stress because of this relationship so it's really the insulin
but stress can trigger it as well so let's talk about like what do you do ketosis is an eating
plan where you're doing very low carbs like 20 to 50 grams per day moderate amount of protein okay
and higher amount of fat in a minute fasting which I highly recommend in combination with ketosis
because if you just do ketosis you can actually and some people even create acne simply because
ketosis is not necessarily omitting snacks between the meals it's you know you can add that it's just
like what you eat but keep intermittent fasting will greatly lower insulin probably just as much
as the ketogenic diet will so the combination of both is a powerful thing I'll put some links down
below so what we want to do is we want to add more fat to the diet healthy fats that's going
to help you with essential fatty acids for the skin dry skin for example is an oil problem in
the skin so after you have these oils in the body and these healthy fats it will give you
essential fatty acids to make your skin really really good but also vitamin A vitamin A is the
key vitamin for nice skin and also a lot of the remedies out there for acne they use vitamin A
why not get it from the food but also if you do intermittent fasting you're going to improve the
gallbladder because you're not going to be eating and grazing all day long you'll be eating and then
not eating eating and not eating that gives the gallbladder a chance to recharge and recycle the
bile bile is a fluid it's like detergent it comes out from the liver and it comes down into a sac
underneath the right ribcage and it helps you break down absorb the fats so within a minute
fasting you have more bile to break down these fats to extract more fat from the food to extract
more vitamin A and essential fatty acid for the skin okay so gallbladder is very very important
and again I think I might have said this but if you're getting acne or a pimple when you
start keto just add the intermittent fasting and handle it right there the type of ketogenic diet
that I recommend is one that includes a lot of vegetables so you're getting a lot of the final
nutrients you're getting a lot of key things like vitamins and minerals that are not in some other
proteins but the fibers in the vegetable actually are food for your microbes so the fiber will help
build up your micro it's called flora which your skin has a lot of flora so the more you
can improve your digestion and the friendly bacteria the better for the skin and lastly
adding these two things together keto and Amanda fasting will greatly lower inflammation and in
acne there's oh and even any skin issue there's always an inflammatory condition okay going on
so overall that is the connection between your skin and keto and intermittent fasting put your comments

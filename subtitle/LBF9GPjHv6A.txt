so I had this question from someone that wanted to know if I gargle with salt
water will that kill the coronavirus well let's talk about that so first of
all I want to say that there's no studies that I found that demonstrate
gargling with salt water will actually kill this virus okay however that being
said there is some research that shows that gargling with salt water could
potentially prevent certain viruses from going down into the lung however before
we get into that I do want to mention that there is some other research that
shows that this coronavirus can replicate in your throat before moving
into the lungs so they found a high rate of replication and viral shedding during
the first week viral shedding has to do with this so when the virus goes in the
cell and it starts to reproduce and then it decides to leave your cell and go in
somewhere else whether it goes outside your body or in another organ that's
called viral shedding and just the fact that you're gargling with salt or just
with water it would appear that you would dilute the concentration of
viruses if there's viruses in there I'm gonna put all the studies that I found
below down in the description but this one was interesting because it was
talking about the anti viral innate immune response using salt to support a
certain chemical in your immune cells that potentially could kill the virus
because if we just take salt sodium chloride okay now there are certain
enzymes in the inner skin barrier inside your body that can convert chloride into
hypochlorous acid now this acid is the main ingredient in bleach that is very
antimicrobial it's been known to kill viruses and guess what certain immune
cells like the phagocytes that eat up the virus and bacteria and fungus and
dead cells in your body they actually will pull in viruses and
bacteria and expose those microbes to this acid
so they make and use bleach hydrogen peroxide they even make a certain type
of antibiotic and they release enzymes to kill off these microbes so let me
just read this one little paragraph that says this mechanism is dependent on the
conversion of available chloride ions okay that's in the salt all right into
hypochlorous acid mediated by peroxidase that is the enzyme that will convert
this to this since hypochlorous acid is the active
ingredient in bleach which has a broad of antiviral range against DNA comma RNA
comma enveloped and non-enveloped viruses the antiviral mechanism should
work against different types of viruses so basically you're giving the immune
system the raw material to make its weapon which one of the weapons is
bleach which is very toxic to us as well as microbes now I want to mention some
of the studies involving using salt water so the first one involved one
hundred and thirty people they gargle with just water and that was efficient
in preventing upper respiratory tract infections and healthy people next one
was a Japanese study on 20,000 children they found no outbreaks of influenza or
fever infections during the process of this study now in 2010 they found
washing your throat with salt water could be considered the most effective
measure for upper respiratory infection in 2013 they did a study with 338 people
using salt water and they found people were less likely to get a upper
respiratory tract infection so this is how you do it it's very very simple it's
a very inexpensive take a half a teaspoon of sea salt okay I would
recommend the Himalayan sea salt but I think any salt will do and if you don't
have sea salt you can even use regular salt and you dissolve it in eight ounces
of warm water and you gargle with that a few times a
day so in summary I think it's a really good thing to do
can't hurt it's a very inexpensive potentially it could help you thanks for
watching

hey guys dr. Berg here I'm going to talk about what is an amino acid okay amino acids basically
are the building blocks of protein and when you have amino acids you have a chain of them
it makes different types of protein okay so when you consume protein your body breaks
it down with the help of acid and enzymes into the smallest particles of amino acids and this
happens mainly on the liver and then your body tissue starts reassembling these amino acids into
many different structures making jeans making blood tissue muscle collagen neurotransmitters
that's like hormones through the nervous system hormones which actually through the blood skin
hair organs enzymes antibiotics they're all made from protein so your body has to make them so you
have simple proteins which are made from several amino acids and very complex protein that's made
from thousands of amino acids it's just like it's an interesting combination because you
have all these different combinations of amino acids that do certain functions and there's
certain genes or instructions or blueprints that tell the body how do we assemble these
things okay so you have this whole translation unit you have this whole blueprint unit and you
have the building unit of the cell to make body tissue so it's controlled by genes and basically
amino acids are needed to make 50,000 different combinations it's amazing so amino acids are a
little bit different than proteins and fat in that they it has an extra nitrogen connected so
it has carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen which allows the protein to repair and build tissue so
amino acids are necessary in the repair of the body especially during stress that's why when
you're under stress you need more protein controls oh my gosh hunger mood emotion many many different
things sleep you also have essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids essential basically
means that you can't make these it must be gotten from the diet now your your bite microbes in your
gut have the capacity to make those but not in sufficient quantities okay so you're going to
need to have certain external types of protein to go in the body because you're not going to
have those but then you have non-essential amino acids which doesn't mean that it's non-essential
it means that your body can make them your liver has a capacity to make certain amino acids from
other proteins that you eat all right also the egg happens to be the most complete high quality
protein it has everything in the right combination in fact there's certain protein standards that are
based on the egg okay so if someone tells you that egg is not healthy that egg is a very very
complete protein all right I consumed four eggs every single day now I did a seminar at Exxon once
and they pretty much said I couldn't come back to do future seminars and I asked them why and
he says will you recommending 45 eggs a day I said no I recommend four to five eggs a day they go a
little miscommunication so they did invite me back the bone marrow in your body makes red blood cells
two two and a half million red blood cells every single second so it's requiring a lot of amino
acids to do that then your GI tract replaces the lining every four days requiring amino acids and
then the skin replaces itself every twenty four days and the bone collagen replaces itself every
thirty years so it takes a little bit longer but that all requires amino acids so basically
you do need complete proteins you high-quality protein you don't need too much you just need just
the right amount because if you have too much protein it could clog up the liver so between
three and six ounces per meal would be optimum alright thanks for watching hey guys thank you

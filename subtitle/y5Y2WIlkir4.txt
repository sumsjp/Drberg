now the question today is can vitamin deficiencies actually cause serious disease now you wouldn't
ever connect a vitamin deficiency with a serious disease but there are quite a few
diseases that stem from nutrient deficiencies now they're called classical deficiencies
so you have the classical scurvy which is a vitamin c deficiency rickets vitamin d deficiency
osteomalacia which is also a vitamin d deficiency which most of the time occurs when you get a
little bit older beriberi which is a b1 deficiency pellegra which is a vitamin b3 deficiency so those
are the classical deficiencies that are you'll see in many many different textbooks you also have sub
clinical deficiencies which don't really show up physically yet they're brewing in the oven
and eventually they create problems down the road and you may notice some symptoms but it's hard to
recognize unless you understand the link between nutrient deficiencies and their manifestation now
a lot of these deficiencies start in the fetus especially if you're not breastfed
and you're consuming infant formula there's some really really important nutrients that
a pregnant woman and someone who's breastfeeding must get in the diet enough zinc vitamin d
folate iodine omega-3 fatty acids these are vital if you're deficient in iodine first of all you're
going to be have a stunted growth secondly you're going to have a lower intelligence
so it can create a lot of issues and so if your mother is deficient in folate you can end up with
what's called a neural tube defect which means part of your spinal column is not closing properly
so your spinal cord is literally being exposed and it's not protected and vitamin d is really
important in maintaining the structure of your skeletal system as well as the tone of the muscles
so if you're deficient in vitamin d you could have things like scoliosis flat feet kyphosis
which is hunchback lordosis which is an excessive low back curve as well as a lot of dental problems
in your maxillary bone and in your jaw and it's interesting because if you look up information
on classical deficiencies they'll tell you that they're rare because of the fortification of foods
where we added synthetic vitamins but let's go down the list and talk about each one a vitamin
c deficiency severe scurvy fatigue bleeding gums that's gingivitis loss of connective tissue
rickets that is low vitamin d your legs start bowing out your bones
start to malform like i've already mentioned you have a lot of muscle weakness and cramps
then we get to beriberi which is a vitamin b1 deficiency now a severe b1 deficiency can create
some serious disease dementia loss of memory neuropathy nerve damage you get brain atrophy
your brain actually shrinks when you don't have a certain nutrient all these vitamins are cofactors
they're helper compounds to allow the chemistry in your body to work right and so if you're missing
one of these cofactors it has profound effects down the road osteomalacia that's basically
soft bones this happens mainly when you get older but it also could occur when you're young as well
with this you there's pain in the legs you have weakness in the muscles you have weakness in the
lower back so how many people have low back pain and they don't realize it could be a subclinical
osteomalacia or a vitamin d deficiency pellegra they call it the four d's it's a b3 deficiency
diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death and then we have night blind this vitamin
a vitamin a is very very important if you don't have enough you can literally go blind
then you have heart attacks if you have a severe vitamin e deficiency your heart can
go into a cramp it can cause angina and you can have a heart attack now a couple things i want to
mention that are a little more interesting than what i just talked about number one
a lot of these deficiencies occur when you consume refined foods okay because especially vitamin e
b3 b1 vitamin c and even a vitamin d deficiency could be created when you're consuming refined
foods consuming refined foods as in refined carbohydrates then lead to insulin resistance and
your ability to absorb these nutrients goes way down but this is what i really want to talk about
these are the causes of these effects these are the symptoms these are the causes right but
when you look up a lot of these symptoms they're classified as a disease or a cause of something
and when you're researching a lot of things like bleeding gums as in gingivitis if you
look to the cause of that you don't even see vitamin c on the list it's not even there and
so they they say well it's a condition it leads to excessive bleeding and you should brush your
teeth more or dental floss your teeth but they don't get into the nutritional causative factors
let's say for example you looked up dementia it doesn't even mention b1 at all or even neuropathy
it doesn't even talk about b1 or let's take dermatitis vitamin b3 is not even on the radar and
even when we get to heart attacks which by the way this should be on the other side of this as being
the symptom of low vitamin e look at heart attacks they'll talk about you know smoking not enough
exercise eating fatty foods etc etc but what about this vitamin e so there's a big disconnect between
the nutrient deficiency effects to all of their symptoms which then are classified as a disease
and it's very confusing and you know when you treat symptoms and you don't really know the true
cause you never really get rid of the problem now if you have not seen my video on the most nutrient
dense foods that you can eat i put that right here check it out before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

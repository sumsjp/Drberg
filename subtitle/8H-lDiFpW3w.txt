now there's an interesting
link or association between using
probiotics in improving acid reflux or
heartburn but the question is why how
can a probiotic that affects the gut
bacteria
affect the stomach in one study i read
79 percent of people who took probiotics
benefited from their acid reflux symptom
so there's a couple reasons why
probiotics might help you
one is that you have to look at the
digestive system as one whole connecting
organ or system and as you affect one
part of it the other parts are affected
so one type of bacteria we have is the
lactic acid bacteria and this bacteria
actually acidifies
a colon then you also have lactic acid
yeast which acidifies the colon as well
so these microbes help you digest and
the more you have complete digestion in
the lower part the better it's going to
be for the upper part like the stomach
if you're not digesting because you
don't have enough microbiome in your
large intestine
that can also lead to an overgrowth of
bacteria in your small intestine called
sibo and that can also back up the whole
system where you get regurgitation of
fluids like for example
lactic acid coming from the small
intestine up into the stomach you can
also have bile reflux or regurgitation
coming up in the stomach and then you
can also have hydrochloric acid that
backs up into the esophagus simply
because you don't have all the help of
your large intestine in the lower part
now the other point i want to bring up
is this gut brain axis or this
relationship between your brain in your
gut
it's connected by a very large nerve
called the vagus nerve and the vagus
nerve is bidirectional okay so in other
words it communicates going up this way
and communicates going down this way so
whatever's happening down here affects
your brain and whatever happens up here
can affect your gut now the unique thing
about the vagus nerve
is that it is part of the autonomic
nervous system specifically the
parasympathetic nervous system
and the autonomic nervous system
controls
all of the valves in the body as in the
valves
on top of your stomach and the valves on
the bottom of your stomach which
regulate the amount of food that goes
through these different passages and one
way that people have a problem with the
vagus nerve is you have some type of
dysbiosis or some type of problem in the
lower part of your gut in the large
bowel now the other connection is that
if you're taking antibiotics for example
one of the big side effects is gerd
and acid reflux which are pretty much
the same thing so what do antibiotics do
they destroy your flora
if you don't have enough flora if you
don't have enough good bacteria that can
severely affect the stomach it can even
give you gastritis or a sour stomach now
the microbes in your large intestine
also make
bile salts so if there's a problem with
that that can also affect the
neutralization of this acid coming into
the small intestine because bile salts
are alkaline and so if you don't have
enough alkalinity that can throw things
off and so you can then have more of an
acid effect in your small intestine
which could not just create ulcers but
it can back up and create ulcers in the
stomach and lead to an acid reflux
situation so this is what i recommend if
you have acid reflux
or if you have heartburn
i recommend consuming
apple cider vinegar obtain hydrochloride
which are both acidifiers that can many
times help the stomach but you also may
need some probiotics and a few natural
good ones are kefir make sure it's not
with added sugar make sure it's whole
milk kefir
another one is sauerkraut my favorite
and kimchi which is a fermented
cabbage product usually eaten by koreans
and actually many other people alright

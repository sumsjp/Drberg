hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the amazing
benefits of cabbage now cabbage is one of the cruciferous vegetables and yes
it's anti-cancer but I want to focus on another benefit an amazing benefit of
help healing your intestinal barrier your intestinal lining it has a natural
chemical called glutamine and it's wonderful for things like ulcers or
leaky gut or irritable bowel syndrome or diverticulitis or gastritis or acid
reflux so anything that's going on with an intestinal wall cabbage is a great
remedy now I recommend taking in a coleslaw or just in a salad make a make
a salad with cabbage or you can even juice it and drink the juice I never
blend it but that might be interesting you can maybe try that but if you cook
the cabbage you want to steam it slightly don't overcook it because you
want to retain those properties but if for those people that have a serious
like a digestive issue oh my gosh I recommend just taking some cabbage in
the diet every single day usually people don't bloat with it they they feel good
with it and it's a wonderful healer okay so that's the that's some of the
benefits so I go ahead and make your comments below and I will see you in the
next video

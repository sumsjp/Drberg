let's talk about if you should be consuming eggs if you have an autoimmune condition
like rheumatoid arthritis ms lupus type 1 diabetes now most autoimmune diseases
stem from gut damage okay eighty percent of your immune system is located in the digestive system
and if we have the lining of the colon and we break the links and we cause leaky gut proteins
can leak into the lymphatic system which is right behind this barrier right here once a protein
like the protein in milk or wheat or egg invades this barrier and ends up right in
this area right here the lymphatic system your immune system is going to tag this as a foreign
toxin okay and now you have an allergy to it and now every time you eat this thing
you're going to be inflamed and these allergic reactions because some of these proteins are
similar to your own cells can set you up for an autoimmune disease where now you have antibodies
they're attacking your own tissues it's in the area of what's called molecular mimicry
one of the things that i always recommend if you have an autoimmune condition
is you go get an allergy test because what's going to happen is if you can identify what you're
allergic to whether it's casein the protein in the milk or the gluten of course if you've been on my
channel you're not consuming gluten because that's a grain but you you may be consuming cheese casein
or egg these two right here are common allergies and if you're consuming these on your ketogenic
diet and you have an autoimmune condition that can actually make things worse so get
an allergy test and then you can isolate what you need to avoid for a while common allergies
dairy it's in the cheese it's in the milk it's in the yogurt there's several proteins
in milk one is casein another is whey and there's actually more of course grains have the gluten
and then you have protein eggs there's protein in nuts there's protein in seeds once you do the test
you'll be able to isolate what you're allergic to and then you can avoid it now another thing that
you really need to avoid if you have an autoimmune condition is vegetable oils soy corn canola
cottonseed oil all of those are omega-6 fatty acids very inflammatory because dealing with
autoimmune conditions is all about reducing inflammation and the last thing you want to do
is add more inflammation to an already inflamed body if you don't want to get an allergy test
here's another idea you can just go three days without consuming any cheese or milk or dairy
and just see how you feel and of course we won't talk about this because i already know
you're not consuming grains but this is a real big one right here the gluten in grains severe
inflammatory reactions you may want to go like three days without consuming eggs
and see how you feel if you feel better chances are you could be sensitive to it
same thing with nuts same thing with seeds the same thing with other proteins like even fish
when you do healthy keto and intermittent fasting and you do periodic prolonged fasting
what you're going to find out is a lot of your allergies are eventually going to go away because
you're strengthening the immune system all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing

let's talk about the importance of
vitamin c and something called a
subclinical vitamin c
deficiency now you may have heard the
term scurvy before which is a very
serious vitamin c deficiency another
term for that is called
classical vitamin c deficiency but
subclinical
is that you have some vitamin c but you
don't have the full
amount now what does vitamin c do
well mainly it works as an antioxidant
okay protecting
against free radical damage it has a
real big important purpose
in collagen growth and repair i'm
talking about connective tissue
ligaments tendons fascia
cartilage all the things related to your
joints it's also necessary to make
noradrenaline and when you're low in
noradrenaline you're just not awake
you're tired all the time
it's also necessary in the function of
carnitine
which has to do with delivering fat
to the mitochondria the furnace to burn
fat so
fat oxidation so if you're low in
vitamin c you're not going to get the
full
fat oxidation to make energy also
your white blood cells part of the
immune system are saturated with vitamin
c
so if you don't have enough vitamin c
your immune system cannot
work when you have a very severe
deficiency
as in scurvy you have wounds that won't
heal you'll get gingivitis inflammation
of the gums you'll get peri-follicular
hemorrhage now what is that
uh that is the little red dots on the
follicles
on your skin it could be in your butt it
could be certain places in your body
that's a vitamin c deficiency
fatigue red purple blotches
similar to spider veins but you
sometimes you see them on the lower leg
you'll see them very commonly with
diabetics and there's a lot of other
symptoms as well
now how do you get vitamin c these are
the foods that have a lot of vitamin c
uh papaya which i don't recommend kiwi
which i don't recommend
bell pepper which i do recommend leafy
greens
a lot of other vegetables are loaded
with vitamin c berries
cruciferous vegetables and in addition
to this a lot of times people take a
supplement
just make sure that your supplement is
not synthetic make sure it's food based
this is a really good source of vitamin
c acerola cherry
which is very different than the regular
cherries that you would eat
but this is loaded with vitamin c so in
addition to getting your vitamin c from
food there's things that will block or
inhibit vitamin c absorption
smoking will inhibit vitamin c in your
body
if you're pregnant the need for vitamin
c goes way
up as you get older and you age your
vitamin c
goes down so you need more vitamin c for
repair
why because it's an antioxidant
also over training with exercise can
inhibit your vitamin c
and this is interesting too when you eat
sugar you compete with vitamin c
so you will not be able to absorb
vitamin c
if you're consuming sugar and
if you're diabetic and you have high
levels of sugar that's going to block
your ability to absorb vitamin c

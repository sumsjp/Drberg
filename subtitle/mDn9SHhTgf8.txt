today we're going to talk about the secret to not only reduce the symptom of anxiety but the symptom
of depression as well it has everything to do with your microbiome that's the gut bacteria
the largest number of nerves outside the brain are located right down here in your gut also the gut
and the brain are bi-directional in other words there's a huge communication line between your gut
and your brain what's happening down here is going to affect
up here and it just so happens that your gut microbiome your microbes make neurotransmitters
and so all the neurotransmitters like gaba dopamine serotonin are made by your microbes and
serotonin can greatly affect your mood and the people who have symptoms of anxiety depression
nearly always have gut issues and also your gut makes me vitamins and there's a huge relationship
between all sorts of mood disorders and a lack of b vitamins if you have gut inflammation
that's going to affect your mood so just by getting rid of inflammation alone that will
elevate your mood now the other point i want to bring up is the link between antidepressants and
how that can affect your gut bacteria it actually inhibits the growth of your friendly bacteria
especially the two psychiatric drugs abilify and nor men and so there's some slight minor
side effects with abilify you could gain weight you can have gi symptoms and with these next
side effects i am absolutely not kidding you can have a strong desire to gamble binge eat
shop and engage in sexual activities now more common side effects are vomiting
sleeplessness dizziness and movement disorders and what's interesting they don't even really know how
abilify works but it has apparently something to do with neurotransmitters now let's look at
something ninety percent of the serotonin is produced in your gut and you have ssris
stands for serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors so these antidepressant drugs
affect serotonin a big side effect from ssris is this it decreases the diversity of your microbiome
and it also creates an alteration in your microbes and it increases inflammation which all three of
these increase the need for ssris so what's wrong with this picture a lot this is what i'm going
to recommend if you have depression or anxiety just focus on your gut get in a good probiotic
start consuming fermented vegetables i'm talking about kimchi or sauerkraut pickles things like
that or even fermented dairy as in kefir maybe some Bulgarian yogurt and do fasting all three
of these remedies can have a significant effect on your mood all right thanks for watching so if

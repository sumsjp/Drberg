hi guys i recently had a question about
vitamin k2 and i wanted to create a
short video to give you the essence of
what this amazing vitamin can do it's
different than vitamin k1 which has to
do with clotting k2 is all about the
transportation of calcium okay from the
wrong place into the correct place so if
you're deficient in vitamin k2
potentially you can get calcification of
the arteries your arteries become very
very stiff and of course that's going to
lead to high blood pressure so
calcium builds up in the vascular system
okay it could also build up in the
joints as arthritis bursitis tendinitis
all the itis
so again
k2 transports calcium from the soft
tissues into the bone and in the bone it
actually affects two cells the
osteoclast and the osteoblast the
osteoblast has everything to do with
building the bone up so
k2 stimulates the building of bone and
inhibits the breakdown of bone that's
what the osteoclast does okay
now
vitamin k2 is a fat soluble vitamin so
it comes from fat if you're in a low fat
diet or if you're
taking statins for example that blocks
cholesterol
then you could be deficient
which is pretty bizarre when you're
taking a statin because what happens
you're going to cut down cholesterol and
you're not going to get the fat soluble
vitamins to protect the heart and you
get this calcium buildup but that's okay
because you're on a calcium channel
blocker for your high blood pressure
doesn't make sense so vitamin k2 is a
fat cyber vitamin and you would get it
from grass-fed meats
dairy like cheese
eggs egg yolks
and also something called nato which is
a vegetarian source which is fermented
soybean it's from japan
doesn't taste good but you might be able
to get it into a pill now the version
that i would recommend would be the mk-7
version not the mk-4 okay so you would
look for k2 mk-7
100 micrograms is the normal amount that
someone would take you would want to
take it with your food because if you're
consuming fat because you're on the keto
that's good because it'll be absorbed
nicely but you also want to add vitamin
d3 with it okay because this is a fat
cyber vitamin these two work together in
the transportation of calcium
now as far as the ratios from d3 to k2 i
would do 10 000 iu's of d3
to every 100 microgram of mk7 so if you
have a really big problem maybe you're
going to 3x or 4x the amounts the ratios
so you take 40 000 ius and 400
micrograms of
vitamin k2 or if you have a mild problem
just take one and one of each okay
so i hope that cleared up any confusion
and i'll see in the next video
hey guys a lot of you already have my

the health benefits of citrus okay we're talking about lemons and limes now of course orange and
grapefruit are also citrus but those two have too much sugar so we're going to mainly talk
about lemons and limes so the citrus fruits have many many phytonutrients okay we're
going to mainly talk about the flavonoids okay one type of flavonoid is called bioflavonoids
which is part of the vitamin c complex and very very important in gum health like your gums if
you have bleeding gums it can actually reverse that pretty quick so i'm not just talking about
vitamin c being ascorbic acid i'm talking about the whole vitamin c complex and this is why i
encourage people to get the majority of their vitamins from food because you get the complete
complex like the vitamin c complex like citrus fruits are the best for that but you can also
get these phytonutrient benefits from not just consuming the fruit but the leaves the roots
and the flowers of the lemon and the lime tree now lemon and limes have pretty much the
same nutrients there they have b1 b2 b3 b5 b6 b9 which is folate they have calcium iron magnesium
potassium and zinc but i wouldn't depend on getting your vitamins and minerals
from lemons and limes the thing that you want to get from lemons and limes is the flavonoids okay
why because they have some very cool properties anti-cancer anti-bacterial anti-viral anti-fungal
anti-diabetic now i've done so many videos with different plants and vegetables and herbs and
it seems like they all have these same common benefits why because it's part of the survival
mechanism that was created from that plant but the cool thing about that is you can eat those plants
to get those amazing benefits that have been created over a very long period of time but
the citrus flavonoids also have the capacity of decreasing central nervous system disorders
decreasing formation of kidney stones especially the oxalates calcium oxalate stones
they can inhibit the formation of the stones as well as calcium phosphate stones as well now the
vitamin c in citrus can completely annihilate and get rid of scurvy what's scurvy that's a
very severe vitamin c deficiency where you have frequent infections frequent colds cracked lips
crack corners of your mouth that's what i had growing up i didn't know what it was
now i've done other videos talking about the vitamin complex specifically b2 and b3
deficiencies creating cracked lips right here but it can also be vitamin c in fact when i was a kid
i think the reason why i had those cracks in the corners of my mouth because i was consuming so
much sugar and when you consume sugar you can't at the same time absorb vitamin c so
it was a vitamin c deficiency that created that problem and also smoking so if you're a smoker
you're going to block vitamin c absorption that's really coming from a vitamin c deficiency because
as you smoke you're blocking any ability to absorb that vitamin c one of the symptoms of
scurvy is ulcers in your mouth on the ends of the mouth and on the tongue now the other real big
symptom of scurvy is spongy bleeding gums so you brush your teeth and you look at your toothbrush
and it's like red what is that that's a vitamin c deficiency but it could be you're just consuming
too much sugar or you're smoking you know and that could be blocking vitamin c or you're just not
consuming vitamin c from the complete complex maybe you're getting it from some vitamin but
it's all synthetic and it's it's not the same thing because vitamin c is involved in collagen
and supporting your capillary strength so if you don't have that vitamin c complex the capillaries
are fragile and they break easily and here you are you go to the dentist and they give you all this
medication because now you have gingivitis and you go down this whole series of things but in reality
it comes down to your your diet now citrus flavonoids can decrease the risk of getting gout
okay inhibiting the uric acid formation it can also help to act as a diuretic to get rid of
excess fluid and increase bile and peristalsis so in certain countries they use a lot of lemon
for digestive issues after you eat i just recommend using lemon in your diet for many
reasons not just helping your digestion but some of these other things as well and lemon
is very very um sour and it can help your liver it can help the production of bile which by
the way um counters constipation because when you're deficient bile you become constipated so
bile is helps lubricate the colon basically and the phytonutrients and citrus help peristalsis
so basically just helps your digestion from a couple different angles all right there you have
it the health benefits of citrus hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

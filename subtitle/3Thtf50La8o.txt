all right i have a quick video for you on the best remedy for hyperhidrosis which is excessive
sweating and that is sage it's a plant you can even get it as a supplement as well
it supports something called vagal tone what is vagal term well the vagus nerve
is a very long nerve extends from your brain stem down through all the organs of your body
and it's part of the nervous system called the parasympathetic so vagal tone has to do with the
activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and excessive sweating is a problem with the opposite
part of that system called the sympathetic nervous system in fact one of the treatments which i think
is barbaric that is being done or definitely has been i don't know if they still do it is to
cut the sympathetic nerve in certain places in the body to stop excessive amounts of sweating
and so as a natural non-toxic way to address excessive sweating you may want to start trying
sage out it may help you they have them in 100 milligram tablets and i would take
probably two or three of those every single day until you experience relief and then play around
with the dosage after that to see what you have to do to maintain it there's other benefits of sage
menopausal relief as in night sweats also benefits to your cognitive function better concentration
more alert better focus better memory if you have excess of saliva this would be a good remedy as
well it's also been shown to show benefit for depression bloating gas and it has antibacterial
properties so if you have this condition you might want to check this out before you go if you have
a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're

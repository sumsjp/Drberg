hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about agave nectar now I get
a lot of questions on this I just want to cover it you know people say it's low glycemic or it's
low carb you know it's in all these little bars and it's in recipes but let's just take a look
at a couple things if we take table sugar table sugar is composed of half of it is fructose and
half of it is glucose okay high fructose corn syrup 55 percent of is fructose in 45% of it
is glucose but agave nectar is 90% fructose and 10 percent glucose now what's the significance
of that basically fructose is metabolized very very very differently in the body now I'm going
to talk about fruit in a second let's just put fruit to the side for a second but if we just
take this concentrated fructose which is 90% of it is in that form what happens it puts a
tremendous stress on your liver because there isn't any cells in your body except the liver
that can deal with fructose like regular glucose all the cells can absorb it and deal with it and
metabolize it but none of the cells can deal with it except the liver so what's happening
when you consume this is it puts a lot of stress on the liver the metabolism of fructose on the
liver is almost identical to consuming alcohol so you talked about creating a fatty liver this
will do it so it creates fatty liver because that fructose is converted over into triglycerides and
it also will cause insulin resistance I'll put some links down below as well so basically it
creates the pre-diabetic State it creates bad cholesterol LDL it creates high triglycerides
which are blood fats it creates high uric acid which turns into gout so if you had a
unit choice between high fructose corn syrup and agave nectar I would go for the high fructose corn
syrup even though I wouldn't consume either one but now let's just shift over the fruit
when you consume fruit you normally consume it in an actual fiber whole fruit right that
fiber in there and all the other things in there majorly buffer the amount of fructose
in there so it does have near the effect that actual concentrated fructose or concentrated
nectar will have on your liver and that's why fruit has a lot less damaging effect
you know the main problem with fruit is it can slow down weight loss okay but the main
thing with this this is not a health food or low glycemic thing it's a very high sugar high sweet
liver damaging product I would definitely avoid it okay thanks so much for watching

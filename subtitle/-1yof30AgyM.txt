if you have painful periods you might want to try ginger it's a great natural remedy and very
effective now in the first day of a woman's period you have some massive changes going on
in the uterus you have changes in the muscles the blood vessels and you have a lot of inflammation
and all this is occurring because of something called prostaglandins prostaglandins are certain
compounds involved in when tissue is damaged and when tissue is inflamed and it helps to regulate
that inflammation and so when someone takes an nsaid like ibuprofen or aspirin they're blocking
certain enzymes that make prostaglandins the problem is there's some slight minor
side effects you have indigestion ulcers you get headaches dizziness drowsiness
you can start developing allergies right but the phytonutrients and ginger can act as a
very potent inhibitor of prostaglandins in the first study ginger was just as effective
as a medication called novofin which is a combination of ibuprofen acetaminophen
and caffeine and in the second study which i'll put the link down below
ginger was just as effective as ibuprofen so the cool thing is that it's just as effective
but without the side effects but in fact ginger can actually aid in digestion it can help you
with digestive issues and as a side note ginger was very effective if you take it at the very
very beginning of your period now just as with any drugs check with your doctor before taking on this
advice all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

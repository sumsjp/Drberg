i want to talk about this very
interesting condition called burning
mouth
syndrome there's not a lot known about
it
it's very subjective the person themself
is feeling this
but there's not very many objective
findings there's no
tests that can indicate that there's an
underlying problem it's very difficult
to diagnose
they call it idiopathic which means
unknown cause
so when i see a situation where there's
unknown cause i like to
try to pull a string and find out a
little bit about it
and there are certain clues on what
might be causing this condition
but if there is a subclinical
nutritional deficiency
it's going to be very difficult to
diagnose that but this is what they know
a good portion of people who have
burning mouth syndrome
are post menopause okay now what's
unique about
post menopause well you have low
estrogen
and you have very low progesterone okay
so we have those two things right there
and we also know post menopause women
are at risk for
b12 deficiency and we also know that b12
deficiency
can also correlate with a burning tongue
okay and also if you're post menopausal
you'll be at risk of b6
and i also found some additional
research that shows that there's this
association between a
deficiency of vitamin b6 and burning
mouth syndrome
i'll put that link down below and so in
all the studies that i looked at
the most common deficiencies that are
found with burning mouth syndrome
would be a b12 deficiency a folic acid
deficiency
a b6 deficiency which by the way
also b6 is necessary to increase
progesterone and so if you're really low
on progesterone and you're using up
all your b6 you could then become
deficient in b6
also they found that a zinc deficiency
can be associated with this condition
too and what's unique about
that is during menopause the adrenal
glands
back up the ovaries so you usually have
more cortisol
stimulation and higher levels of
cortisol will definitely cause a zinc
deficiency not to mention another risk
factor for burning mouth syndrome
is diabetes and when you're diabetic
with all this glucose going through your
bloodstream
you can easily become zinc deficient and
then the last correlation would be
low estrogen which you see in
post-menopausal
females now another thing that may show
up as well as you may have high
homocysteine levels
which can be lowered by taking certain
b vitamins like b12 b6
and even the mineral zinc so if you have
burning mouth syndrome
your best bet would be to take b12
folic acid b6 zinc
and of course do whatever you can to
help support your adrenals
and support any type of blood sugar
issues so if you're new to my channel
i'm going to show you how to do that

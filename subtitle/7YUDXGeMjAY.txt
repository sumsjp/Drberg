you know i've been talking a lot about
anti-aging principles
how to look more youthful but today
we're going to talk about
how to feel more youthful how to feel
younger and nobody likes to feel old
regardless of their age and so what do i
mean feeling old i'm talking about
stiffness are your joints stiff
do you have achy muscles okay that's
called myalgia
do you have
inflammation in your joints
do you have brain fog a lack of clarity
is your mood not where it should be you
have this symptom called malaise
which is just a general feeling of
unwellness
or something called post exertional
malaise which you feel fatigued if you
do any exercise so
as soon as you start exercising or
exerting yourself
you feel like wow there's just my body
is just not on the same page or do you
have fatigue or a lack of energy with
just crappy sleep if you have any of
these symptoms you're going to like this
video now i think most people know
that
your diet is behind
most of these problems but there's
another
hidden cause that i want to make you
aware of that is actually quite common
especially if you have
chronic fatigue in fact roughly 70
of the actual cause of chronic fatigue
is not necessarily related to your diet
it's related to something called latent
viruses
it's a virus that you were infected at
one time
but it's not producing any symptoms
right now it's asymptomatic but
it can be reactivated
as any of the symptoms i just described
so here you are you're exercising you're
on the right diet
but you don't really feel youthful it
could be one of these latent viruses
that's being reactivated now the group
of viruses that are more latent viruses
are the herpes viruses like herpes
simplex 1
2 the epstein-barr virus cytomegalovirus
and even hiv is capable of being latent
and so is hepatitis
so these sneaky little viruses have a
survival mechanism
um to go underneath the radar so they
can kind of go deep in themselves and
just wait okay and they wait for a door
to open they wait for the switch to be
triggered and that number one most
common switch
is
ready for this
stress
so does stress actually make you feel
old or
tired well in actuality it could be
reactivating viruses
that are then creating an immune
response not a full-blown infection but
immune response that can make you feel
like you you feel run down you feel kind
of old
now what's interesting about these
viruses especially the herpes viruses
is that the great majority of the
population i'm talking about
87 of the population
has been infected with herpes and
apparently
regarding epstein-barr virus or mono
95 of the population has been infected
with this virus so given the fact that
the majority of the population
has this virus
and they also go through stress
it's no wonder that these symptoms that
i described are very very very common
even
covet and its variants
can lower your t cell
and
reactivate some of these other viruses
so in other words if someone had a
covered infection
that could reactivate some of these
other issues can put a person to the
state where they have brain fog
ahead joints
inflammation
a lowered mood
poor sleep
long after the covet infection so the
number one most important thing to do is
to isolate
what is stressing you out and do
whatever you can
to improve that situation so go ahead
and type into the comment section what
type of stress do you
have right now so to feel younger
it's vitally important that you address
the stress part now there's another
remedy that i researched that's very
very very potent to help target these
viruses that
are related to latency it won't work
if you still have this stress
and it definitely won't work if your
basic diet is not correct as well so i
think it would work to a very large
degree if your stress is manageable and
you are on the right eating plan and if
you don't know what i'm talking about
i'm going to put that link down below of
exactly what you should be eating hands
down the strongest herb
that can help deal with these viruses
is
sweet wormwood root this is a chinese
herb that's been around for at least 000
years it's a very powerful ancient
chinese remedy and it's good for a lot
of things but it's very well known for
its potent effects against malaria so
it's anti-parasitic anti-fungal
and antivirals at least certain viruses
that are related to the viruses i
mentioned apparently they don't they
don't really know exactly how it works
but apparently it injects free radicals
or oxidation into this pathogen there's
a tremendous amount of research on this
that i'm going to share with you
below
for
fatigue for stiffness for inflammation
for brain fog for symptoms that
that persist long after someone has a
covert infection
so
there are a lot of herbal remedies that
you could use olive leaf is a good one
oregano oil sage garlic thyme
but sweet wormwood is probably one of
the better ones so anyway i wanted to
share this with you but really make sure
that your diet is implemented correctly
and you do whatever you can to deal with
the stress simply because i don't think
any remedy is going to work unless the
stress is dealt with because it's such a
overriding
dominating factor in someone's health so
the next video for you to watch
would be the one on stress i put that up
right here check it out

so i get this question quite frequently how much weight
can a person actually lose when they're fasting now i just want to mention the
difference between doing the ketogenic diet okay and you have
fasting over here and if you combine them it's a whole
different thing but if you're just doing the ketogenic diet alone where you're
lowering your carbs the most that you can lose per week is
about two pounds of fat per week if you're healthy but
what if you're fasting every day how much can you lose
you potentially could lose a lot more you can lose
a half a pound a day and that would be 0.227 kilograms for those Europeans
or that comes out to three and a half pounds loss per week
or 1.58 kilograms per week now just realize that this is
the best case scenario you're not going to lose more than this
you have to have a really healthy metabolism
to be able to lose that much now if you're just starting out you're
probably going to lose anywhere between 7 to 15 pounds for the first week and
that's pretty much going to happen on just about any diet that you do that
lowers the carbs why because you're going to lose a ton
of water weight where is the water weight coming from
it's coming from the stored glucose as glycogen so
there's 3 to 3.8 grams of water in every gram of glucose if it's stored
as glycogen so glycogen which is stored glucose and
your liver and your muscles is like a fluid-filled sponge
and when you're doing fasting you're going to use up the glycogen in your
liver not your muscles but in the liver and some other places to the point where
you're not going to have very much glycogen in your liver and you're going
to dump a lot of water i think most people knew
that but if you didn't that's what it is now there are all
sorts of variables that go along with this depending on
your age if you're 18 years old you're going to lose a heck of a lot more than
a 65 year old so you have your activity level your
exercise level if you're male or female females have more estrogen it makes it
more difficult to lose weight you have how strong your metabolism is
how healthy you are and then you have what you eat when you break the fast
i think that's really important and also your stress level
so these are the variables that will determine if you're going to
lose this much or that much depending on if you're fasting
or just doing the ketogenic diet or a combination of both
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

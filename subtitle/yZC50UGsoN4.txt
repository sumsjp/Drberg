so today we're going to talk about apple cider vinegar versus distilled
white vinegar what are the differences what are the similarities does it matter
which one take well over here we have apple cider vinegar which is about five
to six percent acetic acid and then the white vinegar is about four to seven
percent acetic acid very very similar the big difference is the source apple
cider vinegar obviously comes from apples and white vinegar could come from
grains barley corn sugar potato milk whey believe it or not it's a protein in
milk and other grains and of course this corn could be you know GMO unless this
is organic now with apple cider vinegar in one tablespoon you have about eleven
milligrams of potassium okay it's not a lot of other vitamins or minerals in
this product and just realize that our bodies require about 4700 milligrams so
11 milligrams is pretty insignificant now certain types of apple cider vinegar
like Bragg's raw which is organic has a sediment at the bottom of it it's called
the mother which is a tiny bit of bacteria other things like fiber and
maybe some enzymes and of course over here we have distilled white vinegar
which one is better well it really relates to the source of course if you
have organic apples and you're gonna make apple cider vinegar to these
ingredients obviously this is going to be a much better source plus it has some
additional things to help you however if we take a look at the acetic acid these
are very very similar so the effects of white distilled vinegar versus apple
cider vinegar are going to be pretty close if not identical but because the
source is a low quality I would recommend obviously doing the organic
raw unfiltered vinegar because who knows if there's additional chemicals
involved especially if it's made from corn I don't even know if they're giving
you the source on the back of the label of of what this is made out of yes the
mother has a tiny bit of bacteria friendly bacteria but it's so
insignificant the chances of that helping you are are just very very minor
compared to these two right here so number one it gives you a digestive aid
most people are lacking the acidity in their stomach what happens when they eat
food especially protein is they have an incomplete digestion so they get
indigestion bloating gas they have a difficult time breaking down protein and
that can end up with a lot of issues like constipation and just incomplete
digestion you put a tablespoon of vinegar in a water drink it before a
meal and you'll feel much better plus if you aid the acidity in your digestive
system you'll simulate minerals much better one symptom that a lot of people
have is cramping or even twitching could be the left eyelid or on the arm or they
get muscle cramps in their cap or their foot well if you take vinegar in water
that can make those cramps go away because it alters your pH so you can
start absorbing and transporting minerals much better especially calcium
yes you can use electrolytes for cramping but the vinegar and I always
use apple cider vinegar can really help you with those cramps tremendously also
the vinegar can actually stimulate your liver to make more bile to help with the
fat digestion especially the absorption of vitamin A d e k1 k2 omega-3 fatty
acids and some of the other fats as well the other big benefit of vinegar in
general is the improvement of insulin sensitivity since the great majority of
population has insulin resistance and I don't even know it taking vinegar can
make the insulin more sensitive so you have less resistance and that's going to
end up giving you a whole series of benefits which you'll see all over
place especially online when you look at the benefits of outside of vinegar it
will say it helps you with weight loss blood pressure skin acne well that's
because it improves insulin sensitivity and anything that will improve this will
give you a whole series of additional benefits there's the differentiation and
the similarities if you haven't seen my video on apple cider vinegar that had
over eleven million views I put it up right here check it out

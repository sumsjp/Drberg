so I had a question from someone who made a comment on one of the YouTube
videos and they wanted to know about the anti-aging creams if they should use
those and do they actually work and the answer is no I'm sorry
they don't make your skin any younger what they do is make your skin a little
bit tighter and they do add more hydration on a temporary basis but not
actually younger and in one study which I'll put down below found that the
anti-aging creams will reduce your wrinkles by less than 10 percent over 12
weeks 10 percent is not even noticeable to the human eye so you're you're not
going to really see too much so what is the solution is there a way to reverse
the aging process or at least slow it down and the answer is yes if you
understand the simple concept of inside out versus outside and there's no way
you're gonna actually try to get the body younger by applying something
topically or trying to work from the outside in it really comes from the
inside out and it's combination of several things
but you really want to look at the balance of how much oxidation is going
on or things that are breaking your tissues down or destroying your DNA
versus the antioxidants in the body which are countering all this free
radical damage and just so you know a free radical is an unpaired electron so
let's say for example we have this atom right here that's supposed to be
spinning around and it only has one electron it doesn't have the pair of
electron over here okay it's missing what happens it makes the atom very very
unstable and so it can create destruction to the body and an
antioxidant will donate an electron to stabilize this to create less damage and
there's two sources of antioxidants one is exogenous that means outside the body
from your diet you're eating leafy vegetables you're eating cruciferous
vegetables it is giving you antioxidants and also vitamins act as antioxidants
vitamin E vitamin A vitamin C even vitamin b1 can act as
an antioxidant and they always come in networks because when an antioxidant
donates its electron it then becomes unstable and it can create some problems
so it will borrow an electron from another antioxidant so they come in
networks so you have the food that you eat with antioxidants okay that's called
exogenous then you have endogenous antioxidants your body actually can make
and the oxidants so that's cool so the combination of both need to be in such
quantity to counter the amount of oxidation coming in from the environment
and from your diet that's just making things break down and making you age
prematurely so what can make this worse the big thing is glucose high carb diets
that will trigger insulin which will then combine with certain proteins in
your body and cause this other phenomena called glycation so when you combine
sugar with a protein it creates a protein that's now non-functional and
that's going to make your your tissues less elastic and that's going to make
you look a lot older and another term for that is advanced glycation end
products and that is created by glucose having a high amount of glucose in the
diet the other thing that's interesting is nutritional deficiencies can fail to
supply certain biochemical enzymes that are supposed to repair and keep your
tissue stable at the cellular level so nutrition is a really key part in
slowing the aging process down faster than it's going so the worst case
scenario is this combination between a high carb diet and low nutrients that's
going to age your skin it's gonna make you look older it's going to age the
inside of the body and on the flip side of that if you switch your fuel from
glucose to ketones ketones act as an antioxidant which is really really cool
so it's a much healthier fuel source and I always recommend the healthy version
of the ketogenic diet so that way we can actually add the nutrients from the food
to prevent the free radical damage and keep your skin and your tissues looking
healthy so there's also hormones involved they hormone that you really
want to preserve is growth hormone growth hormone is all about anti-aging
it's all about keeping your proteins intact and I'm talking about the skin
the hair the nails the inside of the body growth hormone is responsible for
that as we age growth hormone goes down we want to keep it as high as possible
so there are certain things that lower growth hormone and there's certain
things that will increase it glucose by the way will lower our growth hormone
insulin will lower growth hormone so high carbohydrate diets stay away from
them cortisol from stress will also inhibit growth hormone cortisol is very
destructive on your proteins on your skin and it will aid you in an
accelerated rate alcohol is another thing that is very dehydrating it will
inhibit growth hormone it will make you look old alright so how do we raise
growth hormone well exercise okay but make sure you don't over train if you
exercise correctly with them enough recovery you can spike growth from about
five to seven hundred percent so that's one key factor regular exercise plus the
exercise can if done correctly reduced the cortisol to stress and then fast and
fasting is probably one of the most important things if you wanted to slow
down the aging process and look younger also when you do periodic prolonged
fasting you stimulate stem cells stem cells actually help you regrow new
tissue like your immune system your gut your skin so fasting is probably one of
the biggest things that can help you look younger it can stimulate growth
hormone by thirteen hundred to two thousand percent and then we have sleep
sleep is another key factor to enhancing growth hormones so if you do
intermittent fasting and prolong fasting you get enough sleep you keep your
stress down you exercise you do healthy keto that is your best bet to slow down
the aging process but to actually think that you can actually do it with a cream
it's just not going to work alright guys thanks for watching
and check out a couple of these very interesting videos I have related to
growth hormone

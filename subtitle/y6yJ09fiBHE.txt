i'm back to answer another question someone wanted to know is there any benefits to fast for 14 hours
so in their comments they mentioned that they consume a breakfast at 8 o'clock
and then a dinner at 6. so we do have fasting for 10 hours during the day
and then we have 14 hours fasting from dinner all the way to breakfast and so the answer is
absolutely there's going to be benefits it's better than consuming three meals a day
at least you're doing two meals a day and there's also a 10 hour fast between your breakfast and
dinner so that's that's not bad so you'll probably experience some weight loss benefits some minor
benefits in the area of cognitive and mood maybe a little bit of a reduction in inflammation but
you're probably not going to experience the benefits of autophagy which has everything to
do with anti-aging and recycling your old proteins to based on the data that i looked at the research
and just interacting with tens of thousands of people the sweet spot to really see some really
amazing benefits is between 16 and 18 hours and then going up to 20 hours of fasting and even
consuming one meal a day which is about you know 23 hours that's when you see not just the
benefits of weight loss cognitive improvements mood improvements and a major drop inflammation
but you also see the autophagy benefits of anti-aging your skin and even scar tissue in
your joints that seems to improve greatly so my recommendation is to start with that 14 hours and
then take advantage of the fasting when you're sleeping i mean you didn't eat all night long
and then go as long as you can and so if you can push your first meal from eight to
nine and then from nine to ten and then if you were to consume two meals one at 10 a.m
and next one at 6 p.m that would give you 16 hours of fasting just make sure you don't snack
and then do that for a week or two and then push it to noon so then your first meal is at noon
and your second meal is at six that will give you 18 hours there's a lot of people doing the 18-6
18 hours of fasting and your six hour window of eating and that will produce some massive benefits
and then over time when you continue you're just going to find that your
hunger goes away and it's going to be really easy to go even longer and longer personally right now
my first meal is about 2:30 or three and then my second meal is at six or six thirty and i'm
definitely noticing huge benefits mood related cognitive drop in inflammation in autophagy

how much sugar do you think you consume in an average year now i did another video on
this topic but i wanted to emphasize a couple additional points now depending on your age
if you're between one and a half years old to three you consume about 36 grams of added
sugar per day that comes out to nine teaspoons of sugar every single day if you're a teenager
you consume about 74 grams that's 18.5 teaspoons per day that's added sugar if you're a little
bit older maybe you have a little less than this now the american diabetes association said that
if you are between the ages of 2 and 18 you need to be consuming less than
25 grams of sugar every day that's six teaspoons of sugar every single day so you want to keep your
sugar under six teaspoons of added sugar well guess what guys this is way way too
high especially since the average person does not understand that all carbohydrates turn into
sugar in the body except fiber as in the fiber in vegetables which is not very sweet so if you're
consuming vegetables it's not going to spike your blood sugars but all these other foods
will and i'm talking about the breads the pastas the cereal the crackers the biscuits the waffles
etc etc so if we calculate all of those carbohydrates as being your sugar amount between
225 grams and 325 grams let's take an average of 275 grams every single day okay of sugar
now this comes out to a little more than a half a pound 0.6 pounds of sugar every single day
or 0.27 kilograms but if we look at this over a course of a year that comes out to 219 pounds
of sugar that is crazy or 98.9 kilograms of sugar completely and utterly insane so what happens to
your body when you consume so much sugar every single day well excess sugar is toxic to your body
it's called gluco-toxicity it creates all sorts of problems which we will get into in a second
but a question that a lot of people want to know is listen i went to get my blood sugar tested it
was normal i consume the average diet which is a lot of sugar yet my blood sugars are normal so
why is that a problem well what you need to know is that what's happening with all that sugar it's
being quickly routed out of the blood through this hormone called insulin so the purpose of insulin
is to remove excess amount of sugar out of the blood how much excess anything more than one
teaspoon of sugar okay is removed from the blood very quickly through the help of insulin why
because it's toxic but guess what the more sugar you eat the more insulin that's going to be pumped
out and insulin is also toxic to your body just do a little research on hyperinsulinemia and you'll
find out all the complications the symptoms that are created from high levels of insulin are almost
identical to the symptoms created from high levels of sugar so the chronic exposure of both sugar and
insulin on your tissues creates a lot of problems even before you become a diabetic which by the way
does take some years to develop because your body is constantly pumping out insulin
to keep your blood sugars normal another question that people want to know is where is that sugar
going well it's being converted into fat in the liver around the organs and through your belly
if you happen to see anyone walking around with a belly then you know that they have
excess amounts of insulin and definitely excess sugar in their diet now let's take a look at
a few problems just some slight minor problems with this excessive amount of glucose and
insulin it's going to affect the heart it can create clotting which leads to strokes
and heart attacks it can stiffen the arteries causing high blood pressure
it can cause angina a lot of different issues with the heart it can affect your teeth and the
need for braces if your child is consuming a lot of sugar early on simply because simply because of
how sugar affects the dental malformations the digestions are they're probably going to need
braces it really affects the brain in that it can create add brain fog moodiness depression anxiety
and affect your cognitive function memory focus and concentration it can affect your hormones
on a huge scale one being pcos which is high levels of androgen because high insulin
increases androgens so if you're female you get facial hair you have hair loss you
get a stomach and you get a deeper voice it creates inflammatory conditions of your skin
acne definitely cystic acne and your skin is not going to look very good it alters the bacteria
throughout the body including the bacteria in your mouth giving you bad breath it's
highly inflammatory in your joints so you start noticing stiffness and pain bursitis
tendinitis and definitely arthritis if you play sports your endurance is going to be a lot
less you're definitely going to be noticed fatigue and tiredness of the day especially after you eat
and you'll definitely start getting up through the night as you get older because your bladder
will be more active at night than during the day you may need glasses to see because the blood
sugars destroy the eye at many different levels the microvasculature of the nerves
cataracts glaucoma and eventually a diabetic neuropathy and of course the classic belly fat
is the result of that because the liver is filling up with fat spilling over around the organs in
your midsection eventually nerve pain tingling burning in the bottom of your feet or the hands
and there's many additional symptoms so i think you get the point the average person is just off
the charts they may only consider this added sugar as being their their sugar but it really
includes a lot of other carbohydrates so share this video with your friends and family member so
they can increase their awareness on what they might be doing to their body unknowingly and for

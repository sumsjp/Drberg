you always want to stretch after your workout or exercise not before now this
is very counterintuitive you would think if you stretch before the exercise you're going to
reduce your risk of injury but that's actually not true you can actually increase your risk
of injury if you stretch right before the workout why because most injuries occur when the muscle
is in a lengthening phase not a contracted phase so static stretching does not prevent injuries
it can lower your performance it can weaken your muscles it can even decrease blood flow
to the muscles so the best thing to do is to stretch after the workout that can actually
increase your parasympathetic nervous system so what should you do before the exercise
well a lot of top athletes do dynamic stretching i'll put some links down below of what that looks
like but you're actually working the muscle as you're stretching it it's just very very unnatural
for the muscle to stretch it without any type of contraction the next thing that you should do
which is very very good is eccentric contractions i did a video on this very powerful while you're
contracting the muscle while you're lengthening it and then you pause bring it up a little quicker
and then slowly like maybe three to four seconds you're bringing it down and you can do this
with any part of your body but you can actually decrease the risk of injury when you do eccentric
contractions especially the hamstring you can actually decrease hamstring injuries by 50 if you
do eccentric contractions also you're training the muscle to control that stretch force so the more
control less injury you're also increasing range of motion and flexibility and as a side note you
can actually do strength training to increase your range of motion and flexibility it's pretty wild
now i want you to do an experiment okay and then come back to this video and post what you observed
okay so this week i want you to take one of the workouts that you normally do and stretch before
the workout and then the next day with stretch after the workout and i want you to observe the
performance the endurance of that exercise your flexibility how far you're able to touch your toes
or your general range of motion and just compare these two things and then comment down below
you're going to find that if you stretch after the workout your flexibility your range of motion is
going to be much much better hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

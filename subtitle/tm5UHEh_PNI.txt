so we're going to talk about chromium picolinate for insulin resistance
let's first summarize what insulin resistance is
it's simply a situation where the receptors for insulin
are not taking up insulin they're resisting it and then the feedback loop
goes back to the pancreas to tell the pancreas to
make more insulin so you have a situation where you have
high levels of insulin now but it's not effective it doesn't work
and what's wrong with that is that there's a lot of side effects
with high insulin prediabetes diabetes belly fat
artery problems eye problems kidney problems heart problems brain
problems and the list goes on and on and on so
chromium is a trace mineral needed in very very tiny amounts like
micrograms and here's what it can do it increases glucose
transporters now if you think about it if you have a block
insulin receptor insulin controls glucose we're also going to have a
problem with glucose so it will help
glucose become more sensitive and that's going to
also help insulin become more sensitive so it starts working better
number two it decreases stress in and i'm going to kind of give you a new term
here endoplasmic reticulum what is that
it's this little thing in the cell that is a factory
that makes proteins and certain lipids that make up the body tissue
and that's really where insulin resistance originates at the cellular
level so stress on this structure
this little factory actually creates insulin resistance
so chromium decreases the stress on that little factory
number three it inhibits inflammation so not only will chromium
decrease inflammation it's an anti-inflammatory but it will decrease
oxidative stress also number four it can increase glutathione which is
the most powerful antioxidant in your liver
and in certain other parts of the body so this right here is going to improve
insulin resistance so i do have this ingredient in some of my products
because it really helps blood sugars but mainly
it's going to decrease cravings it's going to get you in keto
faster and it's great for polycystic ovarian
syndrome why because high insulin and insulin
resistance is really behind pcos
now if you would like to know what foods are high in chromium
i put a link down below before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's
not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the US
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

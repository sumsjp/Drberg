well hello everyone welcome back and today i have a
very special guest Siim Land is actually here with us and he is an author of
several books amazing books um specializing in
autophagy which is what we're going to talk about and fasting
and keto he's also a great content creator
he's a holistic health practitioner and he's also a high performance coach
so welcome uh sim how are you doing hey i'm
doing really good i'm glad to talk with you excellent
so um you are going to be speaking at our summit coming up so i'm very excited
about that i already got your slides and uh um people
are gonna be blown away and you the first thing i want to talk
about is um you did you get into this topic
of fasting because you had a personal problem or was it just you're just
interested in it uh i i never had like any health issues
so i've basically been pretty healthy throughout
my entire life but i got into intermittent fasting when
i was uh doing you know weightlifting and bodybuilding
in in high school so it kind of just became
more of like a dieting tool and just a nutritional tool
so i tried it out first and i just started enjoying it and then
from the from there on i also just delved a lot into more of
the research and i started writing about it in my
blog which then turned into the youtube channel and
several books and the podcasts interesting because usually in
universities and they don't really emphasize fasting or
low carb it's usually high carb right so you kind of just found out about it
somehow yeah like i did my own like research on
youtube and okay just discovered discovered like
different uh and also like listening to different
podcasts and learning about keto from there and
just trying it out myself ah okay great awesome and um you also went to school
for i think uh an anthropology right yeah yeah i
it's a bachelor's degree in uh cultural anthropology
did you get into you know ancient civilizations as far as what they ate
back then did you was that a topic that was
covered extensively or uh we we did have like a few modules
about history and hunter gatherer specifically
so yeah we did cover a lot like i remember like one
of my uh essays final essays was on the topic of uh
why the uh hunter-gatherers converted over into
like the agriculture and uh that sort of thing
and like kind of change the entire history so they say
wow and it was it was quite fascinating actually that it wasn't like this
pre-planned thing or it wasn't like a natural it wasn't like a natural
natural outgrowth of like uh evolution or society
it was more like a coincidence because uh you know
over like ten thousand years ago twenty thousand years ago the hunter-gatherer
populations were already constantly moving in between being a
hunter-gatherer for some seasons and for other seasons they were already
growing crops so they just probably
embraced this sort of like a very uh seasonal
lifestyle and for some reason or in a very coincidental manner
there was this during one period they they
eventually um hunted out all of their uh most uh available game
uh meet so to say they out hunted like this
gazelle population there was also like a very cold season so there wasn't
uh a lot of food in in total so they were kind of forced into starting uh
these small villages and uh then from there on
the hunter or the farmers just had like a
slight edge over the hunters because they were able to store food for much
longer and therefore they just like out
competed the hunters in a very coincidental
manner wow fascinating did um
is i wonder if there's a lot of any data on the type of um
the type of foods they ate back then as far as
the hybrids that are now like let's say fruits versus vegetables back then i
mean you didn't have watermelon you didn't probably have these sweet apples
like they had they probably had you know bitter wrappers is there any
data on that i couldn't find any actually
uh well i'm pretty sure that the the foodies was like more fibrous uh
less carbs less energy and total less sugar and
yeah more like the harsher to digest i would imagine so
um yeah like it's so true that the apple or the
um the watermelon is completely different
uh nowadays than it was even just a few decades ago so uh
like in the you know ten thousand years ago the foods were completely different
wow and then what about um i'm sure like even the banana wasn't
that sweet back then yeah absolutely um now as far as
there's been some data on just out of curiosity the uh since you're on the
since you're you've studied this what about the amount of um
the quantity of potassium foods like vegetables is there data i i've heard
references that uh sometimes they as much as um you know
the month like 11 000 grams of potassium foods is
that do you have any ever heard about that um
i not really sure about that so like they probably wear it depends on
the location as well so like if the
population is more near to the equator then they would probably get more
potassium from like fruits and vegetables and those things
but and likewise all hunter gatherers did some form of uh foraging so
they all got a little bit of potassium from those sources
uh not sure if they got exactly like 11 000
um i wouldn't imagine maybe you know probably changed throughout the seasons
and changed also like on a daily daily basis
is there and then one last question and then we'll start our interview
um what about um did you ever find any data in like the
earliest um did they find any humans early on
stuck in the ice that were preserved that
um they were able to dissect in the stomach and see what they ate
like the earliest uh man um well i i recall um one of the
oldest like mummified humans the founding ice
i think his name was like ozzy or something in in
switzerland i think in the alps and he had
like he had actually like a patch of uh some like mushrooms so you know in
the mountains eating these medicinal mushrooms and
different kinds of fungi is probably a really
uh more easily eatable source of nutrition
and i think you know the humans back then they ate
you know whatever they could find so it probably consisted of
both different kinds of roots and vegetables as well as
meats and foul and fish even makes total sense okay great well thank
you um so the first thing i want to do is i
want to get into autophagy for those of you that are new
it might be a new topic for those of you probably most of you know about it but
can you give us a real basic uh kind of an idea of what autophagy is
yeah sure like autophagy translates into self-eating and it's describes this
intracellular process where different particles and weaker
components of the cell or dysfunctional components of the cell are being
recycled and it even is involved in the immune
system functioning and reducing or finding reactive oxygen
species and pathogens so yeah it's a very it's a very
intrinsic part of the functioning of the cell and there
is always like some form of basal autophagy happening on a
daily basis so you know fluctuates on depending on what
you do but generally autophagy is more of like a response to some
form of like a stress or like energy deficit so it gets
activated primarily when you're you know either fasting you're
restricting your calorie intake you're doing some form of exercise or
you're exposed to some other kind of stress with even like
you know even things like the emf or electromagnetic frequencies can
turn on autophagy to a certain extent blue light does it
and the sauna the cold a little bit so yeah it's a it's
like a stress resp so like a cellular stress response and the main purpose is
to yeah like just recycle kind of tighten the budget so to say recycle the
the ingredients and the the components of
the cell that aren't necessary and that are just
like unneeded interesting so i would imagine um
in the area of cancer when you're doing fasting
in fasting in general if we just talk about fasting related to
cancer do you do you have any data that you can share with
i guess both turning on certain genes and expressing certain genes and turning
off other genes as well as autophagy because as you're
cleaning up damaged mitochondria and dna
damage you're going to basically help reduce
resist risk of cancer uh yeah i the kind of current consensus as
i've seen from the researchers is that autophagy
is great for uh disease prevention and uh
preventing yourself from getting sick from different kinds of diseases like it
can protect against insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
as well as some malignant tumors and cancers but at the same time there's
also a lot of research showing that
in the presence of an already existing malignancy or a tumor
then the process of asafoeti can also promote its survival so to say because
uh is like like i said it's a recycling
process and it doesn't have like an object
objective judgment about what's good or what's bad what's a good cell what's a
bad cell so the the idea is that the cancer cell
is just going to steal the energy that gets created from
atopaji and it's going to use it for its own benefit
and if you inhibit the process of autophagy then you can
you can see that it could help to in some cases
get rid of the or let's start out some of the cancer
so it's a very complex situation and it's very context dependent
so not all cancers benefit from autophagy and some of them can actually you know
die from it where some others don't so it's a very
i wouldn't say that it's gonna cure cancer so to say it's great for
preventing yourself from getting sick and kind of keeping your house clean
but at the same time if you're already sick then i wouldn't place all of my
bets on it and the research also says that there
are potentially some negative side effects to it got it
what about fasting in general uh you have
the you know the starving off of glucose and glutamine which cancer can
consume but also you have the expression of certain genes
do you have any data on that as far as related to cancer
um turning off you know genes that are related to triggering cancer or growing
cancer um well yeah like for example
um well well i do know that ketosis and fasting can uh inhibit heat stacks
which are associated with aging and cancers as well
so they're histone diacetyl i'm not sure what their full name is yet
but essentially they are these uh related uh inhibitors that can be caused
with some diseases uh but yeah like autophagy
uh also like um yet it it it promotes some other forms of uh
health as well like usually autophagy is activated when you are under energy
stress and uh for example it's uh
turned on by this particular pathway or the fuel sensor called ampk
which which promotes the kind of fuel mobilization of
of the entire body as well as ketosis and that has been shown to have
like um like anti-aging effects as well as a disease
prediction okay and the reason i'm bringing this up is because i had a very
interesting um person call me uh he's been studying um
you know autophagy and fasting and keto and and about a few years ago
he came down with um a diagnosis of prostate cancer stage four
spread metastasis to his bones and his uh
he started getting bone pain through the rib cage and spread all over through his
body and not only did he already have
diabetes and every other symptom metabolic disease but he came
towards this cancer so the doctor said sorry um
we can give you some drugs to for the pain but there's nothing we can do he
goes to three different doctors and then he starts going on youtube he
starts studying on youtube and um learns about fasting
so you know he's a pretty smart guy because he
there's some data that was shown that if you fast
for too long you can deprive yourself of nutrients
and that doesn't help the immune system that can actually make things worse so
what he did is he did a 45 day fast now normally
you wouldn't go that long but he did because he wasn't hungry
and he had a lot of weight to tap into but but what he did
is something that i don't think there's a lot of research on
and i think there's a little bit of data on but it's hard to find it
he just took a lot of nutrients while he was fasting
because you know when people say you're gonna do a true fast you're not gonna
take anything else well he took a lot of nutrients
and he also took um concentrated um phytonutrients like out of garlic um
and turmeric and several other ones that were um
you know they've been known to help to inhibit the formation of cancer so he
was doing all that and uh for 45 days and so he went back
um to the doctor and the bone cancer was gone it was negative
and so was his prostate cancer and so he is
um the doctors just don't know what to do don't know what to even think of it
you know you would think they would be like wow
let's uh let's find out what you did they weren't even interested but anyway
he um he wanted to tell me a story i did an
interview on him i'm going to release the video probably on monday but
fascinating data on um what happened to his body when he did a 45 day fast with
nutrients i mean you like out of all the people
that i know that had stage four i've never met anyone who survived
i don't know have you have you um no not really and it's it's a yeah like a
really i've also heard like similar stories where people
go on this very long fast and even do things like dry fasting and those things
uh but yeah like i i would imagine you know
giving your body some some some of those nutrients is also
very beneficial because um you know some of those compounds that you mentioned
like um the turmeric it can also promote
uh further autophagy as well so these different compound polyphenolic
compounds and plant compounds ginger cinnamon
cayenne pepper you know berberine they also
uh can turn on autophagy and have like other other medicinal benefits yeah
fascinating so um yeah i'm just learning all about
like learning exactly what he did because obviously it worked for him and
it's some great data but um yeah so i'll share some of the stuff that he found
that i've never even heard before he he found some data and i don't know
if you've ever heard this that there's some differences between
the ketones that are generated from fasting
versus the ketones ketones that are generated from
diet have you ever heard that before um yeah like uh the only
the only uh difference that i've seen has to do with some of the
uh ratios between nad and nadh as well so for example for clarification nad is
like this coenzyme in the body that's involved
with virtually all processes and especially in the
metabolism and nad is uh fluctuating or it's cycled
between nad plus and nadh and uh you know
if your energy is let's say lower your energy status is lower
like when you are fasting then your nad is higher than energyh
whereas if you're eating then your nadh is uh higher
and in a d has is like a role enhanced aging and
uh just general longevity so the older you get the less energy you have
and the sicker you are the also less energy you have so that's why probably
fasting can help with raising your energy levels
and the way it does it is by re-promoting the recycling of nad
because then it is like the majority of your nad on a daily basis is
being created from this uh the salvage pathway
which is uh which is not the right from diet it's that derived from
the recycling of the energy and the fasting as well as exercise are
one of the most like the best ways of going about it because the ampk that i
mentioned is needed for uh turning on that salvage pathway
so you need to do something that puts on like energy stress on the system
in order to regenerate your nad that's fascinating because
you'll have people that are trying out keto and instead of going on the keto
diet they take some exogenous ketones and they
as a supplement they think they're uh they're really doing keto and they're
gonna get all the benefits um not quite um
what's your um what's your thought on this comment that a lot of people
make um well i don't want to do fasting because
i'm going to lose all my muscles
well yeah it's a fair fair point or a fair concern
because like you don't want to become emanciated or
lose your muscle mass because muscle mass is really important for just
longevity as well as metabolic flexibility so
with more muscle mass the more carbohydrates you can also tolerate
and the more insulin sensitive you are the
the more like more glycogen you have to store and you'll also be able to just
get away with more calories without gaining weight
so from a like functional perspective as well as aesthetic perspective
muscle mass is really important and the fasting doesn't
well fasting is like a inherently catabolic state
you are like breaking down your uh tissue
and uh if you don't compensate for it with adequate nutrition then eventually
you will start to lose muscle uh so yeah that's why the key aspect of it is to
make sure that you if you even if you are doing some fasting that you also
re-feed properly and you get like the key nutrients
needed for muscle maintenance and growth especially like protein is the most
important thing so combining like a low protein diet
with internal fasting is not a good idea because uh
you're staying in a very catabolic state and you're not getting enough um
like building building blocks for promoting a muscle maintenance
so so isn't there also um a protective mechanism that
does tend to conserve um protein fibers when you do a fast
yeah there are certainly is like growth hormone
which gets released while fasting does have a like anti-catabolic effect
and uh it promotes fat burning and maintains muscle mass
as well as ketosis or ketones themselves ketones that have
anti-catabolic effects and autophagy even
has some anti-catabolic effects but but it's more of like in a hormetic way
that a small amount of uh autophagy and small amounts of catabolism
make your body more resilient against it so if you never
experience any like fasting or if you never experience
any small amounts of muscle metabolism then you would like
wither away really really fast if you if you ever skip a meal so to say because
yeah like the body needs this small amount of stress in order to actually
get stronger and benefit from it but at the same time like
you know eating an actual meal is still more uh muscle preserving than any kind
of fasting although the fasting is very beneficial
in doing it so if if you were too fast when you're not
doing ketosis then that's much much more catabolic than if you were too
fast when you are in ketosis so that's why i believe like combining
uh fasting with some form of a keto diet is a is very is much
healthier or is much easier as well because you all just feel
more energized and you'll get less hungry because you'll just be burning
like the fats and ketones versus um someone doing keto i'm sorry
intermittent fasting and doing a high carb diet right that's
what you're talking about yeah like i i really i believe like um
it's still better than nothing like uh you can still do intermittent fasting and
gain some of the benefits if you are doing like a high carb diet
it's just gonna be from my own and other obvious people
experience it's uh usually slightly harder because you're
uh running on this you know glucose burning engine
and your once your glucose runs out so then you go into like a mild energy
crisis which doesn't really happen if you are
like fully keto adapted you'll just tap into your body fat and not
experience like any energy dips or you won't get hungry
during day time and then this is probably another
good reason why you should exercise uh to
keep your muscle mass there right because exercise does stimulate uh the
growth of muscle yeah yeah exactly like it's um it's the
like most important part of it like you need to
send a signal to the body that it needs to have a muscle
yeah so um so i guess the key to if you were to do
fasting and you were to do um and you want to
preserve your muscles and you're eating protein but you're massively stressed
out the cortisol spikes uh that's probably
not going to be good to preserve muscle yeah yeah like cortisol cortisol breaks
down muscle tissue but but at the same time
cortisol also mobilizes fat so it's a very again
depends on the dose a little bit of cortisol is good but too
much is bad and if you're chronically stressed out then
eventually yeah you're going to lose your hair
you're going to imbalance your hormones and lose muscle mass and
cause problems sleeping so yeah in most cases the
morning rising cortisol which happens after you wake up is beneficial
because it's going to start today but you don't want to have like high amounts
of cortisol in the evening and when you're about to
go go to bed yeah so there's a difference between the
chronic uh overwhelming stress and some some intermittent stress that you
can recover from especially like i know women when they
go through menopause and let's say they get some overwhelming
personal problems that just can't go away boy they just
they can really wither down and just get atrophy like crazy
so i've seen that many times yeah i want to mention this topic that's
confusing for a lot of people maybe you could
help educate people in a way that's very simple
mtor like what is mtor in the simplest version that you can explain
yeah well in the simplest way i can say it's the
growth switch in the body that promotes growth of all cells whether that be
muscle cells nerve cells immune cells and
even some cancer cells as well as you know
fat cells in some cases as well so it's like a all-encompassing
growth switch and uh mtor in small amounts and in the right dose
is great because it's again useful for muscle building and muscle maintenance
so without emptor you would die because yeah you know you would just
wither away eventually but if your mtor is
you know chronically activated and it's expressed in
excess then that can also cause some you know disease uh like for example a
good sign of too much empty activation is acne
and skin problems and because it's related to ige
one as well so you know some form of uh higher blood sugar diabetes that can
cause that can be result from too much mTOR and and you know the
worst case scenario is some cancers and malignancies
because because of the same like uh growth
promoting aspect so how would we translate that into something practical
like what would you want to do to not overdo
it to create not too much mtor but just
enough is it just related to what we talked about as the
your stress and overwhelming stress versus a little bit of stress here and
there uh well it's it's not really
you know mtor is raised by some key factors like uh
one of them is protein amino acids the second one is like carbohydrates and
insulin and the third is uh overall calories so
if you're eating too many calories the renter is already going to be
turned on to a certain extent and lastly it's also the eating frequency so uh
basically if you eat a bunch of junk foods all the time
very often then your empty is going to be turned on all the time
so uh the best way to kind of mitigate that is to
cut down on the eating frequency you know skip a few meals do something
interesting and as well as limit your like
carbohydrate intake and not spike your incident all the time
so because you know dealt you know you can choose to either
restrict carbs or restrict protein so if you if you restrict your protein
then that can have like a negative effect on your muscle maintenance and
just because protein is more essential than carbohydrates
you need protein to survive but you don't need carbs to survive so it's like
which one are going to choose so uh you can you could have both but
yeah the idea is to not over eat either of them and uh yeah like just
fixing insulin resistance is also important
because uh if you have like a higher blood sugar all the time
throughout the entire day like a pre-diabetic
then that's also like uh going to at least
turn on mtor to a certain extent so you you're going to be in this hyper insulin
insulin mix state all the time how would how would you um what would you
recommend for someone as far as the amount of protein someone
should consume at a given meal well if we're talking about like a one
particular meal then the the well i would say that
if you do eat a meal then the goal of that meal should be to stimulate
muscle protein synthesis um because that's going to
first of all is going to trigger the maintenance of muscle tissue
and if you're trying to like build muscle tissue then it's also
needed to consume at least a certain amount of protein
to make it happen and the research shows that the minimal effect
comes from at least 2.6 grams to 3 grams of leucine per meal
and which which leucine is the most anabolic amino acid that turns on mtor
and you can get that amount usually from like at least 30 grams of
protein so i think the minimal amount of protein
you should get from one meal should be 30 grams
and the upper threshold for that appears to be around like 40 grams
so there's not going to be like a additional benefit beyond
40 grams interesting so that it doesn't but it doesn't mean that
you but it doesn't mean that you can't eat more protein
per meal either your body is just going to slow down some of the digestion
and it's going to absorb it like like later in a few hours
so you could even eat like you could even eat the single days of protein in
one sitting in one meal and the body wouldn't like lose or it's
not gonna you're not gonna waste it away your body
is still gonna absorb all the protein it's just gonna do it in a small
slower manner and so if we look at the that in ounces uh with sounds to me
that would be something between i guess three and a half to seven ounces
what's your what's your conversion on that uh i'm i'm not sure
like uh i i don't use ounces but uh right like 30 grams of protein depends
on the protein source as well like um if we're talking about like
chicken breasts then one i think one chicken breast has
at least like 30 grams or 40 grams whereas if we're talking about like uh
salmon then salmon has a little bit less uh so
yeah it depends on depends on the protein source but i i i like to
i i like to look at the grams and usually like maybe
at least like a fist fist size is like a piece of meat or something
he's like 40 grams i think okay good so i mean even like if you do eggs which
is uh very bio available uh one egg is seven grams yeah so we're
talking um you know you can do the math five five
four five four five eggs is uh is perfect for for for that
because eggs also has very high in leucine so
you can get you can get the all the leucine that you need for that
stimulation from like 4x 5x and you're talking per meal per day
uh per meal yeah like you know in total the the research shows that
there isn't even for like high level physic physical athletes
and uh sports uh people is there's no benefit beyond eating
0.8 grams per pound of lean body mass per day
so that's like the upper threshold that no one really needs to consume beyond
and for the average person who does who just you know works out on a regular
basis then for them they could get away with
like 0.7 grams per pound of body weight i do believe that the slightly higher
protein intake is better because the rda for protein is
really low like the rda for protein is like 0.4 grams
per pound of body weight which is just like the bare essentials for
surviving and not with the wrong way so for optimal
uh because like the research shows that the higher protein diets tend to be
better about body composition they tend to increase like
fat loss as well as increase muscle growth
and they're also like slightly more satiating so people naturally tend to
under eat when they do increase their protein and intake a little bit
so i would aim for like promote let's say for example
um a person who weighs let's say 150 pounds or 160 pounds
then for them they they could eat maybe like 120 grams of protein
per day or 100 grams of protein at least like the minimum
that's what i would aim for okay and then um
if obviously if someone is younger and they have a fast metabolism
and they don't have insulin resistance instead of going keep continuing to go
up with the protein maybe they should add more fat
as calories yeah like the uh well they if they if they were to be
eating more protein then that the extra protein will
eventually be converted into glucose and sugar basically which isn't is which
isn't necessarily like a bad thing but it's just
you could also eat carbs at that point so you're not getting like additional
muscle building benefits from that you're just wasting more energy for
digesting that protein but yeah like adding adding either
once you have hit the uh like the goal for a protein intake then the way
to go up from that and if you still have like calories for
the day then that will be either like fats or carbs so depending on
your preference i personally do like to have more fats
um because of uh just me trying to maintain some aspects of ketosis
but i'm not like really strict with my carbs either so i'm
i'm like eating plenty of vegetables so i'm not afraid of getting kicked out of
ketosis because of eating like broccoli or cauliflower
so right yes like the fibrous carbs are pretty
benign in my opinion and they don't really affect my like ketones and
blood sugar no mine either um so just so people got that it's point
eight grams per kilogram of body weight right
uh uh point per pound okay so you add that calculation so it's
0.8 grams per pound of body weight
yeah that's that's the upper upper threshold and
you know for if you are like really doing a lot of like exercise then you
could also get for like one gram per bond
but uh 0.8 is already at least the research shows that
that's already optimal those okay at the maximum and the
and the minimum would i would say is like 0.6 or 0.7
yeah per gram yeah so if you if your metabolism
is uh let's say you're um your digestion is really bad and um
you have problems digesting protein you maybe you need to go a little lighter
than that kind of vary depending on what's going
on with your physiology yeah absolutely yeah like um yeah it's a
very individual based thing so if you if if a person like i
would i would i still find a lot of merit from
doing like a very strict keto diet like the therapeutic keto that
for people who have like some insulin resistance some severe diabetes or
like epilepsy and those things and yeah if they do have like
uh some problems digesting protein then yeah for sure keeping the protein more
moderate is uh better in a sense because uh at that point you
can still leverage a lot of the anti-catabolic
effects of the ketosis itself as well absolutely
another question people always ask is that
if i take mct oil during a fast will that break my fast
i get that so often i just want to see your intake on that
yeah it's a common question and uh you know
mcts are like a really interesting like substance
so they're not they're not like they have a very thermic effect so they
raise your metabolism uh because of being converted into
energy really rapidly so they bypass some of the steps in digestion and
energy production so uh they're they get converted into
energy really fast and you know a lot of the times
if people take too much mct oil then they can also get the runs
so uh go goes out really quick as well but generally from the the uh calorie
perspective like the calories it depends on like what you what you
mean by breaking the fast right right it has calories so therefore it
could break a fast but at the same time it doesn't spike
insulin it doesn't raise blood sugar it actually boosts ketone body
production and it also stimulates some aspects of atovaj so
there are there's a different kind different type of autophagy called
chaperone mediated autophagy which is uh like a subcategory and it
targets specifically certain amino acids so uh like rather than going for
like rather than going for like this macroautophagy you would go for
more of a very specific type of autophagy that
like recycles amino acids specifically so i think the
having like some mct oil in your coffee or something
then that's not a problem in my opinion as long as you're not really over doing
the calories so like one one tablespoon of mct oil is a pretty
fine in my opinion and it's actually a boost it's very
boosts a lot of the like the goals of the fast by putting you into deeper
ketosis and uh turning on some atovaj as well
that's interesting that's great um your your book you have a new one coming
out right i don't think it's released yet i think it's called the stronger by
stress is that coming up is that out yet no it's coming out in august in the
middle of august oh okay good so then we can actually um
talk um we can actually bring it up at the
event um and so you also have quite a few books um how many books do
you have out uh well it's uh like five i would say
five yeah and so the i think the one that
seems to be the most popular i know it's the uh metabolic autophagy is that the
one that uh yeah yeah it's the it's my latest book
and yes it's the most comprehensive and uh the biggest
so i'm gonna just recommend that everyone get that book and i'm gonna put
a link down below simply because it autophagy
understanding it can make you live longer
it can actually help you prevent so many problems it could
increase your performance um your your anti-aging i mean it's just so many
things and i think you've done an exhaustive study i
appreciate that as i went through it i'm like boy you've
done some serious research on this i mean like you've looked at everything
and um because it takes a lot of time to dig
out all this stuff and summarize it and communicate in a way that everyone can
get it so i'm like thank you for summarizing
the whole topic into one book um yeah i mean how many hours
did you put into that book uh well i did like a lot of research
beforehand so i was already writing out articles
for like a few weeks and then i took like a small break
uh from from writing because i didn't i didn't plan on writing a book
but like i saw that there was like a lot of uh
misconceptions about the autophagy and just myths and uh
rumors so i wanted to kind of refute them like one of one of them being that
autophagy is only good that you want to turn on autophagy all the time
for the rest of your life which isn't true like we talked about earlier in
this podcast that uh sometimes this can
actually be harmful so yeah you have to find out like the
optimal balance between it and uh know how to balance it with like
mTOR and just the adequate nutrient intake
awesome this has been awesome so thank you so
much for your time and hopefully everyone could make it to the
uh summit coming up in at the end of august i'll put the links
down below and then you have a very amazing presentation that uh
um everyone needs to be there because you'll you're gonna go through this
topic extensively because i saw the slides
and it's quite quite exciting so thank you so much
yeah yeah i'm looking forward to it and yeah thanks for having me
absolutely

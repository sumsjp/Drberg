hey i'm back again and today we are
going to talk about wheatgrass juice
powder okay
especially the the version that i have
because it's very very high quality it's
it takes six months to grow
it's grown on an ancient sea bed
on a thousand acre organic farm and it's
virtually raw and i have it at my site
check it out
there it is right there can you see it
now i know some of you have been
complaining about the shipping the
transportation because it could take up
to one or two days to deliver it to you
so we added a new feature on the site
that you're able to get a lot faster all
you have to do is go to my site and do
this right here
there we go
it's a lot more convenient that way you
don't have to even do any shipping you
just go ahead and grab it right out of
my cart all right so what we're going to
do is we're going to take a little
container we're going to get some water
and uh well wait a second this seems
kind of light
for some reason i got an empty bottle
but no worries because we have another
feature
that we can actually make our own
wheatgrass juice so i have another
secret i'm going to show you just kind
of promise not to tell anyone
i'm going to give you the link down
below you can go to this site right here
which actually
is access to the farms where we get this
wheatgrass okay so you just pull it up
go right in here and pull it right out
there we go
got the wheatgrass and all we have to do
is simply
do this
squeeze it
comes out and we can just pour it right
into this little container just like
that
there we go
very nice good
wasn't that simple
now we have the wheatgrass juice and
a little gonna take out the little
shavings here but is it good and so what
i do is i have this every morning and i
drink it when i get up after my cup of
coffee it has tons of chlorophyll
chlorophyll is really good to heal the
inside of the body your gi tract it's
loaded with trace minerals
vitamins and minerals
especially
phytonutrients that have additional
health benefits okay so if you haven't
tried this go ahead and try it i'm going
to put a link down below check it out
for yourself

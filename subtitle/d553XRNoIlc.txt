hey guys today we're going to talk about
the only carbohydrate
that has the potential to lower your
insulin can you guess it
fiber yes fiber is a carbohydrate
and it's the only carbohydrate that can
lower your insulin
how the gut microbes in your large
intestine
eat fiber as their primary food okay
you can't digest the fiber so they take
care of it for you
and then they turn it into short chain
fatty acids
they take the fiber and turn it into fat
so basically if you're on a ketogenic
plan you're consuming
a good amount of fat and you're also
consuming fat through a via
through the fiber so let's talk about
how this carbohydrate can actually lower
your insulin
one of the short chain fatty acids is
called butyric acid or
butyrate there's others but this is the
one that i'm going to primarily focus on
right here
and by the way this fatty acid is also
in butter
so butyric acid improves
insulin resistance it lessens the
resistance to insulin
thereby lowering insulin all right
number two
butyric acid is the primary energy
source
for your colon cells all right number
three it decreases
inflammation so if you have ibs or
any type of inflammatory condition it
has the potential to do that as well
that's why butyric acid from for example
ghee which is kind of like a filtered
butter
is really good for the colon and good
for ibs and any type of inflammatory
condition
number four it has the potential to
decrease risk of
colon cancer all right number five it
increases glutathione which is a very
very potent
antioxidant all right number six it has
neuroprotective properties
not just for the brain but for all the
nerves in your gut which you have
quite a few i recommend the fiber you
get
should be from vegetables the vegetables
will also provide a good amount of
potassium and magnesium which also
will improve insulin resistance okay
now a lot of times when we talk about
vegetables there's a lot of questions
that come up
regarding bloating anti-nutrients and
i'm going to put a link down below of a
video that i
just released covering that in detail
all right guys thanks for watching and i
will see you in the next
video so i want to thank you

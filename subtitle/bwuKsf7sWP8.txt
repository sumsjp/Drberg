hey guys dr. Berg here listen I wanted to talk about a common mistake but a lot of people make
was going too fast with intermittent fasting okay so here you are you're running your body
on carbohydrates your whole life now we're going to switch to ketones so you're going to be key to
adapted if you're not key to adapted yet which takes some time then you don't have ketones to
run on it feel you're just running on sugar okay stored sugar which is called glycogen so it's
stored in your muscles and your liver so when you go from one meal to the next over a period
of time you're not switching to fat-burning it you're basically going to tap out your glycogen
Reserve and the blood sugars are going to go lower okay as soon as it goes lower it's going
to activate adrenaline to raise it but in the process adrenaline is a stress hormone so it's
going to activate the hypoglycemic symptoms and this is what happens with people making
this transition into ketosis or they're adapting they get lightheadedness dry mouth thirsty they
get tired easy weak muscles craving irritable nervous all these symptoms so cortisol will start
increasing so we don't want to add that stress okay so here's what you need to do you need to
do it gradually so you start with three meals a day no snacking do that until you're comfortable
okay you can do it easily then go three meals within an eight-hour period okay then you go
into two meals with an eight-hour period and you do that for a while until you can do it
adding fat to the meal to go longer okay but the temptation is this to jump right in and just do
it too fast then you end up not getting anywhere so it's a gradual process sometimes people take
I don't know maybe two weeks to two months to get into this state where your key to adaptive where
your body is like it can switch to fat-burning and you're running in your fat and you have no
drop in blood sugars okay so now you had two meals eight-hour period now we're going to
slowly go to seven hours of your window of eating okay to have one meal seven hours later another
meal then go six hours and then five and four okay so you want to do it very gradually until
you get comfortable so you don't have this adrenaline rush okay just an important point
that I wanted to bring up thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report

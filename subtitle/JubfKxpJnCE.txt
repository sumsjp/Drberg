so does keto ever not work let's discuss this subject keto is a tool it's the solution to
a problem okay the question is what is the problem what problem are you trying to solve
are you trying to use keto to help your brain are you trying to use keto for inflammation or are
you trying to lose weight let's focus on weight loss with this video and instead of focusing on
the solution let's dive more into the problem let's define the problem what is the problem
well you're overweight but what's causing this overweight problem is there more than one thing
that causes someone to be overweight yes but the most common cause is high insulin in which case
keto will help you let's say you have a slow metabolism right well there could be other reasons
why you have a slow metabolism a combination of let's say you're post-menopausal you're getting
older let's say you have a thyroid issue let's say that you you spend your whole life dieting
and your metabolism is just very very slow yet you're doing keto you're doing three keto meals
you're doing keto snacks in between the meals is it gonna work probably not why because you need
to also add intermittent fasting okay because your metabolism is very very slow so keto will work but
you're going to have to add something else but you definitely want to do keto because if you
were to do a high carb diet with intermittent fasting that might not work simply because
insulin is at the root of the problem and insulin will determine whether you're going to lose weight
or not depending on if it's high or low if it's high you're not going to lose weight if it's low
the chances are you may lose weight but depending on your metabolism you may need to add some other
things like intermittent fasting but let's say you're doing keto and it's not working because
your stress is too high you have high cortisol you had a huge injury surgery trauma major loss okay
loss of a loved one that high cortisol can literally block the effectiveness of keto
so you might need to do keto plus something that addressed this right here i have a lot of
videos on cortisol i put a link down below but you're going to have to add some other things
to keto next one high estrogen let's say you just got pregnant and you gained a lot of weight
and your estrogen went up and from that point on you just could not lose weight because you
have high estrogen is keto going to fix high estrogen well it may help but you might need to do
something to counter this high estrogen level and this is why the information i have on body types
can come into play because i talk about what to do for high estrogen what to do for high cortisol all
right next point is if your thyroid is a problem that's gonna not only affect your metabolism
but ninety percent of hypothyroid cases are autoimmune it's hashimoto's
so in that case you might need to have to work on your gut because that's where the autoimmune cases
originate okay i don't want to get into the woods too deeply on that but i put some links down below
for more information antibiotics could be another source of why people gain weight farmers fatten
their cattle by putting them on antibiotics if you had an antibiotic you may find if you don't
replace the good bacteria you may have a very difficult time losing weight despite going on keto
now let's say for example you have sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth you might
need to alter the type of ketogenic diet you do and do more of a carnivore for a couple months
which is a slight version of keto you're still in keto but you may not be able to deal with all the
vegetables that are creating irritation in your gut next one is a lack of exercise you have to
realize that exercise has a very very small effect on weight loss it's like 15 of your weight loss
success 85 percent is going to be the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting so i think
exercise does have a place and you should add it into the mix but realize that exercise alone
is not going to solve your problem because if you're on a high carb diet and you're exercising
you're not going to be that successful you might lose a little bit of weight but then you're going
to plateau all right what if you have a liver problem where you have ascites where you have
this fluid-filled gut well it might appear to be that it's fat and there might be some fat in the
liver but you've gone past the fatty liver chances are you have cirrhosis now in the liver and the
liver is so damaged that it's leaking fluid into a sac around the gut is keto going to help that it's
definitely going to help that but you're going to have to also do some things for the liver
to help prepare the liver to help get that fluid out and you're going to have to probably eat foods
high in potassium to push that fluid out so we do want to recognize this keto as being a powerful
solution but you might need to tweak that plan and add additional things as a solution but then
the next question is this if you have the right solution to the right problem is it being applied
correctly if at all i can't tell you how many people that i've run into that do sort of keto
they're not consistently doing keto they're cheating along the way they might every other
day have a cheat day well then it's not going to work so when people say that keto is not working
i always try to find out are you actually applying it correctly because they might be
doing sorta keto or maybe dirty keto with any ingredients from a fast food restaurant but
they're not applying the ketogenic diet that i would recommend which is the healthy version
of the ketogenic diet but with more and more people gaining weight like 71 percent of
of adults being overweight in the u.s and 39.8 percent of them actually obese
i think keto is going to become more and more popular but you might need to tweak the plan
but then you also need to apply it correctly all right thanks for watching so if you're enjoying

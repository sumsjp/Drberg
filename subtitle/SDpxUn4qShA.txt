let's talk about the 12 different ways you can trigger the condition called
autophagy so the word autophagy means self eat because your cells are basically
eating up and recycling damaged proteins and malfunctioning organelles or pieces
of the cell that are no longer working now a lot of benefits can occur from autophagy
one is anti-aging number two is dropping inflammation number three is
improving your immune system because part of the recycling process involves
cleaning up pathogens microbes candida parasites and even viruses but I believe
that the biggest benefit of autophagy is decreasing the risk of cancer because if
you think about it cancer can't actually exist unless there's first damage to the
mitochondria so if you're going through autophagy and you're cleaning up all the
damage in your mitochondria you basically bring your risk for cancer way
down so there are several things that can trigger autophagy that go beyond just
fasting number one regular exercise and the key word is regular not like a one
time thing you do periodic exercise it's regular consistent exercise not only
will it trigger autophagy but it'll increase the capacity of autophagy so
you're just gonna clean up more damage in the body so the research on exercise
includes both resistent training and aerobic type exercise aerobic exercise
really improves autophagy of the brain and I'm going to put all the references down
below so you can check them out number two intermittent fasting this is the one
that most people know about and you'd have to fast for at least 18 hours to
really see the benefits of autophagy and if you go up to 48 hours you're
gonna see more and more benefits you're basically recycling all the little
damaged proteins or cellular machinery inside the cells that basically are
not helping you they're hurting you all right number three ketones so
ketones can trigger autophagy they also protect the neurons they feed the
neurons they can actually stimulate autophagy in the brain clean out some of
this amyloid plaquing that's involved in dementia all right number four sleep
this is when you recover autophagy occurs when you're in recovery mode this is why
stress blocks autophagy but sleep can enhance autophagy then we get hyperbaric
oxygen therapy has the capacity of stimulating autophagy cold and hot
therapy because it triggers certain genes that stimulate that mechanism okay
number seven coffee I'm not talking about drinking pots of coffee because
you're gonna get too much caffeine but it's polyphenols that can stimulate some
autophagy and then wine which by the way I'm not recommending but it does tend to
stimulate at autophagy but it has other effects that could be damaging to the
liver alright number nine cruciferous vegetables
specifically the phytochemical called sulforaphane can trigger autophagy green
tea stimulates a certain phytonutrient that can also increase autophagy
extra-virgin olive oil has a phytochemical that has the ability to
stimulate autophagy in human studies some of these other ones are in animal
studies number twelve mushrooms shiitake and oyster mushrooms stimulate this
chemical which has a capacity to increase autophagy so if you combine all
these let's say for example you drink a lot of wine at night okay you're gonna
get drunk go to sleep you're gonna sleep a lot deeper initially anyway but
of course you're gonna wake up with a hangover so you're gonna need more
coffee then you can go and make yourself some breakfast with mushrooms fried in
olive oil maybe put a little cruciferous vegetables drink your green tea and then
go for your daily exercise and then start your intermittent fasting and
realize that was a joke you don't want to combine them together but if you have
not seen some of my other videos on autophagy check them out they're on the
screen now

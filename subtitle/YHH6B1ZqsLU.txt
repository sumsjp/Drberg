hey guys today i have a topic that is probably not very popular because no one wants to talk
about it but we're going to talk about pale colored stool i mean someone needs to talk
about it mice will be me right all right so what is it well before i get into what is it i'm going
to explain a little background of how you would develop that problem okay so to understand that
we have to kind of go through a little bit about chemistry i'm going to keep it really really
brief and simple there is a chain reaction in the body that occurs when your blood cells break down
so if your red blood cells are getting older or they're damaged your body is going to recycle them
so the hemoglobin which carries the oxygen which is the protein part
splits off so the iron goes this way which is red and the heme goes another pathway to the liver
and so the hemoglobin turns in the heme then it turns into something called biliverdin okay
biliverdin which is a green colored it's a green pigment it's what makes your bile green because
the bile helps excrete it from the liver into the small intestine where it can be eliminated
so we have heme then we have billy burden which is green
and then we have a substance called bilirubin and that is yellow kind of orangish yellow
and that is what makes your urine yellow and it's also something that if backed up into the
liver into the skin it'll turn your skin yellow or your eyes yellow as jaundice so i'll come back to
that in a second so in the small intestine some of that bilirubin which is yellow gets absorbed into
the intestine into your blood turns into urine that's why it's yellow and then you also have
bacteria that act on bilirubin they help oxidize it and they turn it brown so your stool normally
should be brown from the bacterial oxidation of bilirubin so that's a little foundation of what
you need to know now what happens and this is a very common problem is if the hemoglobin breakdown
chain reaction doesn't occur from the liver to the small intestine and it gets kind of stuck
or blocked because someone has a gallstone or some sludge through these little ducts they're
called bile ducts and the medical name for that is coleostasis where the bile is not moving properly
let's say for example you get a blood test and you have high levels of bilirubin right
but you also have dark colored urine you have pale colored stool could be like gray colored
what's happening is we have a blockage so we're getting darker urine and we're getting absence
of this pigment in the stool and that's why it's a light kind of a chalky color
so we don't get this pigment ending up in the stool so it's light colored or clay colored
that usually means you have some blockage in the bile ducts or it could mean your liver is
not producing bile because it's damaged so one good symptom to tell you if you have a blockage
between the liver and the small intestine and primarily the bile ducts is light-colored stool
dark urine um a little bit of jaundice could be one of the symptoms as well as itchiness which is
the bile being backed up into the skin and bile is very very very beneficial to your body but
not if it's in the wrong place so we never want bile to be kind of stuck in
the liver because it's a detergent and we'll start irritating and creating inflammation
now the simple solution to all this is simply to take purify bile salts because
because if it's blocked we're having a more of a super concentrated cholesterol situation
cholesterol crystals and it's the bile that helps to break that up so taking more bile and empty
stomach maybe twice a day will help to open up the flows from the liver to the small intestine
and restore the the problem but there's a deeper problem and that usually has to do
with the person's diet so if you're new to my channel and you're not familiar with what to eat
i put a link down below check it out because you need to be on something called healthy keto
and intermittent fasting to really get rid of the deeper root cause that's behind this whole thing
in the first place all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

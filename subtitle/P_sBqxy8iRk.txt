hey guys it's me I want to talk about TMJ and give you some instant relief now
the thing about the TMJ is that it's usually a secondary problem it's usually
not a primary problem in the jaw it's referred either by two different sources
okay and the first source is the teeth aren't fitting you go to the dentist and
get some teeth work done and after that the tooth isn't quite fitting with the
rest of the mouth and that can create TMJ in that case you need to go back to
the dentist have them check it and shave down the tooth that's too big so they
can fit things better okay the second thing is the gallbladder which is
interesting because the gallbladder has something called the meridian and a
meridian is a nerve channel that goes right to the gallbladder up through your
jaw and I'm going to show you if that's the case what to do let me just take my
jacket off here for a second so
gallbladder problem will cause TMJ faster than anything so it's really
simple if you have jaw pain on the right side just press on your gallbladder on
the right side it's underneath the right ribcage and about inch below on the
right side you press in there and hold that point for about two minutes and see
if the jaw pain goes away because that Meridian that nerve channel goes right
through the jaw and you may just find it instantly goes away never comes back
okay and if it goes away you may be eating the wrong foods right that
causing the gallbladder problems like the sugars and like combination of
refined carbohydrates things like that but let's say for example it's on the
left side okay the left side you have the pancreas not the gallbladder but
most jaw problems interestingly are on the right side and on the left side but
if it is unless I go ahead and press on the left side underneath the ribcage
about an inch below hold it for two minutes and you may just find that just
completely clears up in which case chances are you're probably eating too
much sugar because that's irritating the pancreas so it because you have a lot of
nerves that go up through these channels alright because the gallbladder Meridian
goes to both sides it goes right up to the jaw so here you are working on
the jaw getting adjusted when the fact the problem is not in the jaw it's
coming from down here so how do you know that's true well go ahead and try it and
see if it goes away then we know that's the fact so those are the two most
common reasons why the TMJ is there and it just won't go away
so go ahead and put your comments below and I will see you in the next video

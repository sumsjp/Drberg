i want to talk about a natural remedy
for
an anaphylactic shock from a severe
allergy and usually they use what's
called an epipen
which they inject into your muscles and
that's epinephrine and epinephrine has
some very unique
functions in that it can
dilate the bronchial tubes it can open
up the coronary artery it relaxes the
smooth muscle it increases more blood
flow to the muscle and smooth muscle and
it increases the heart output so it
counteracts these very severe allergies
but there are contraindications for
epipens
so what is the person to do if they have
this anaphylactic shock
if they have an overactive thyroid
if they have diabetes or a disease that
sounds like parkinson's but it's not
it's another disease called parkinsonism
and then also if you have glaucoma you
can't take epinephrine or high blood
pressure or angina or if you have
cardiac heart disease okay so i want to
give you an alternative but let me just
run through some of the symptoms
the symptoms can be
life-threatening but typically you'll
get itchy-ness a rash your eyes might
swell your lungs will tighten up to the
point where you can't breathe your
throat can tighten up your tongue can
severely swell where it can obstruct
your breathing get shortness of breath
light-headedness you may even have a
loss of consciousness low blood pressure
or you might go into shock and this can
happen from an insect bite
or some insect venom
or it could be from nuts like a peanut
or seeds like in sesame seeds or milk
shellfish
fish
eggs
sulfites which is in dried fruit
it's in red wine
byproducts of fermentation so if they
took nutritional yeast or apple cider
vinegar sourdough bread also it can come
from antibiotics dyes
latex exercise can trigger an
anaphylactic shock in certain people as
well as side effects from vaccines it's
really weird that we have these
allergies we're rejecting something from
the environment and then when we come in
contact with that thing
it can create all sorts of uh negative
reactions and they can be very intense
the interesting thing about this is that
children that live in a sterile
environment when they're
raised tend to get more autoimmune
diseases
and tend to get more severe allergies to
the point where you can have an
anaphylactic shock because
there has been no stress
on their immune system to build it up
and the reason i'm bringing that up is
we're born with half of our immune
system okay and then the other half
is acquired it's called the acquired
immune system and we develop that
through being exposed to certain
things and then going through the
reaction and having our immune system
being stressed getting sick recovering
and then now being prepared and
bulletproof
it's kind of like if you had an army
okay that
were never properly trained you never
stressed out that army in fact you
probably gave them stress cards and then
you also never put them through basic
training you made it very easy for them
and so when they're exposed to another
army they will be easily defeated
so this is just another example of how
important it is
not to be
stress-free all the time especially with
a child i mean children that live on
farms that are exposed to a lot of
microbes
children that pets have a much better
immune system so if your child gets sick
don't think that's a bad thing if your
child gets sick often
don't try to
quickly suppress the fever
or the cold or the sinus problem let
them go through this immune system with
good nutrition but don't think it's a
bad thing what's a bad thing is living
in a sterile environment for too long
all right now let's get to some of the
remedies for an anaphylactic shock and
the first one is called f a h f
ii okay
it's a combination of nine
chinese herbs i mean it's double-blinded
placebo-controlled clinical trial tested
against peanut-induced anaphylaxis and
it stands for food allergy herbal
formula real easy to remember and you
can seek out this formula and get it if
you have an anaphylactic shock and just
keep it ready because if it can help you
with the peanut allergy chances are it
can help you with other types of
anaphylactic shock reactions you know
there's a lot of chinese herbs out there
that have been known to help
anaphylactic shock
severe
and so here are some other ones sweet
chestnut
asian rose
and the third one is hearty orange so if
you can't find one maybe you can find
something else as a backup but it'd be
important to keep this
you know close by you in case you run
into a situation and of course what i'm
telling you right now check with your
doctor before implementing because i'm
not telling you not to use an epipen
okay just want to point that out the
next four remedies i'm going to talk to
aren't necessarily to handle an
emergency anaphylactic shock okay
they're mainly to reduce the sensitivity
over time so it doesn't keep creating an
anaphylactic shock or a severe
hypersensitivity so number three is
called oral immunotherapy okay
and the effectiveness is like 60 to 80
percent in which you're giving a person
a very small dose of the thing that
they're allergic to
over
months okay so there's a certain amount
that you can give a person that they
don't have any reaction and so you give
them that amount supervised by a doctor
and then you slowly increase it
to the point where you're now tolerant
of that that substance okay so that's
one
kind of natural therapy and number four
vitamin d vitamin d is very important to
build the immune system up uh it's
really a steroid it's it acts like
cortisol but it's an immune modulator so
it tends to regulate the immune system
which is exactly what you need to do all
right number five fasting has been known
to
significantly reduce hypersensitivities
and allergies
because it corrects the immune system
now i would recommend doing a three-day
fast once a month if you get
anaphylactic shock for whatever allergy
and you did a three-day fast every month
and then you also did routine in a
minute fasting
i think you would see significant
improvements just from that alone and
the last thing i want to mention is
probiotics
here's the thing right now there is
current research being done
on
developing certain type of probiotics
that can
greatly reduce allergies and even the
intensity of anaphylactic shock so the
exact formula of which microbes or
beneficial microbes you need to take is
just unknown right now i think any
probiotic would be better than no
probiotic
i mean think about what the side effect
of an antibiotic is
allergies that's one of the side effects
and even anaphylactic shock
so probiotics are important since 80
percent of our immune system
resides in our colon and since allergies
are related to the immune system
you should check out
my video i did
on
doing fasting to strengthen your immune
system and i put that one right up here
check it out
you

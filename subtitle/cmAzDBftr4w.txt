it's been a while okay okay all right hey guys Hey hello take two
welcome back we are gonna make a new recipe what are we making we are making
recipes we're in this fat bomb mode and bomb get your fat bomb on and we are
doing sort of a cream cheese fat bomb series mmm delicious
okay so here we go this is called the raspberry cream cheese fat bomb mmm that
sounds delicious it sounds really good okay so nothing stops here at the Berg
house but but Yolanda it's okay yeah we're okay well clearly she runs
this house not us so we're just gonna keep going going with the cream cheese
blackberry top um so try it listen what I like about it is that
there's two layers there's like a raspberry and then there's a lemon cream
it's lovely it's like yes you know with these fat bombs I find that the the
flavor is the nicest when they're not rock-hard when they're just a little
thawed but put it in the fridge yeah but with the cream cheese I'm not gonna lie
not gonna like I'm not gonna be a liar that it can be then kind of super soft
like mushy so if it's super sauce is it super super soft it's super easy right
super simple ah yeah any words of nutritional advice with these things
well this is a combination of raspberry and lemon
that is the exact flavor of the electrolyte powder
so that's how much that's right I think that this is good this is good so when
do you eat it Eric well here's the thing Karen if you ask me
you guys know always at the end of the meal not as a snack okay you make a note
mental note note to Karen note to self okay good right all right let's show them

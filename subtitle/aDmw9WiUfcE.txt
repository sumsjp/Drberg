so today I want to talk about all the things that could happen to you if
you're deficient in omega-3 fatty acids now typically when people think omega-3
they think fatty fish and that is absolutely true
like salmon or sardines very very good sources of omega-3 but when you consume
a fish that's not very fatty like cod fish you're not going to get a lot of
omega-3 when you eat the meat but if you have cod liver oil okay which is a
concentration of oil in their liver you're gonna get a real good source of
omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamin A and vitamin D so if we compare the cod
liver oil to even salmon you're also getting additional benefit of vitamin A
and vitamin D so I do recommend that two to three times a week you consume fatty
fish or do some cod liver oil or seafood to get your omega-3 because if you're
deficient in omega-3 these are the 15 things that could happen to you you can
develop rough scaly skin okay you can also develop dry skin as well as
dermatitis which is kind of a general name for an inflammation of the skin and
that can be Zima - all the way to psoriasis and everything in between if
someone has dermatitis and they take omega-3 fatty acids usually you see a
nice improvement where off the bat dry eyes could be another symptom dry hair
age-related macular degeneration arrhythmias arrhythmias can develop from
an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency fatty liver so you would think that consuming
a fat that's what this is would make the liver worse but no it actually makes it
better especially if you're doing the right type of fat hypertension so an
omega-3 fatty acid deficiency could increase the risk of hypertension also
can increase the risk of angina as chest pain and an actual heart disease loss of
memory dementia inflammation it could increase your risk of getting
inflammation also muda sore like depression and even anxiety
increasing your risk for getting allergies and ADHD so you can see the
vital importance of omega-3 on the brain on the heart on the skin and on the eyes
so if you want a little bit more information on this topic I put a video

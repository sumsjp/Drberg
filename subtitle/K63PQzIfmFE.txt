let's talk about what bile reflux is maybe you've heard of acid reflux
but bile reflux is a little bit different sometimes people
confuse them the difference between bowel reflux and acid reflux or
gerd is simply in bio reflux you have the bile
from the small intestine see there's a tube that drains into the small
intestine because the gallbladder squeezed out its
contents into the small intestine but then that bile is now backing up
going the wrong way it should be going this way
it's going the wrong way it backs up into the stomach this valve is
dysfunctional it doesn't keep things down here
and so now it gets in the stomach now if it's in the stomach
it's going to affect the ph of the stomach and bile is a detergent
so it will dissolve certain things it'll create inflammation and
ulcer and gastritis another name for bile reflux is
or alkaline reflux gastritis or biliary reflux now gerd is a little different
this is a situation where we normally have the acid from the stomach
coming up in the esophagus but here's the thing with bile reflux
the bile can also come up into the esophagus
and create some serious damage into the esophagus too
so they do cross over but typically gerd is mainly acid coming up through
this valve and bowel reflux is just bile coming up through this valve right here
the bottom line is what do you do for this condition
it's interesting because it's counter-intuitive you would think
okay we have too much bile so we need to inhibit that take a drug and problem
solved right well one of the remedies or the
solutions for bile reflux is to actually take
bile salts so what's going to happen it's going to allow for more flow of
bile through the system so bio will help stimulate the flow and
the thinning of bile so it's not turning into sludge so it
can prevent stones and it can actually flow through
the body even to the liver right here so one of the remedies for
bile reflux is mouth salts in fact one of the remedies for gerd
is bile salts too can help both if there's irritation or an ulcer in the
stomach you wouldn't want to give someone betaine hydrochloride or apple
cider vinegar because that's going to irritate it
but they may benefit from bowel salts because bath salts are alkaline
but typically if there's not an ulcer there's not inflammation in the stomach
that's what gastritis is a person with gerd would greatly benefit
from betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar
and also those two acidifiers will help release your own bile salts and
help reduce bile reflux too so the combination of
both acidifier with bile would be a good
solution unless there's an ulcer and you would
know it real quick because you're going to have more pain
when you take this acidifier anyway in summary i wanted to give you some extra
information about what to do for bile reflux
it's fairly straightforward start taking bile salts
you can even take one an empty stomach or a few after
a meal and that should help you but also remember that the underlying
root cause to this problem the first place is there's something wrong with
your diet so i'm going to highly recommend that

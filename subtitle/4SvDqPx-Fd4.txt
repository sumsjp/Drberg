all right low salt will make you
tired now this probably i should have probably put right here low amounts
of salt just to make it more of a complete sentence but you get the meaning there's a
symptom called keto fatigue this is so easy to fix if you understand the mechanism which i'm about to
explain all right so here's an average person before keto they're holding on a lot of stored
sugar okay called glycogen for every gram of glucose that is stored they store three grams of
fluid water so when you store glucose you are holding on to a tremendous amount of water like
three times as much you're a fluid-filled sponge then you start keto right you lose the water and
guess what else you're going to lose the salt the loss of sodium triggers a hormone in your adrenals
you start massively increasing this hormone right here called aldosterone and aldosterone
is an adrenal hormone has a purpose of making sure you don't lose all your sodium because
you can't live without sodium within two weeks if you completely cut out sodium you will die so you
need sodium to live so this is a very important survival hormone to make sure you don't lose all
the sodium now here's the problem when you start increasing aldosterone you at the same time lose
the potassium so now we have a situation where we already lost our sodium now we're going to drop
our potassium now just from that alone that can cause fatigue that can cause muscle cramps next
point is that because you just lost the water in salt you're going to start to become dehydrated
so you're going to get thirsty so most people when they're thirsty they start drinking more water but
they may not add salt with it so when you drink more water without the salt or sodium you start
diluting this electrolyte mixture and now we go from a sodium deficiency to a worsened sodium
deficiency okay and the symptoms of low sodium are weakness which could also be this right here
headaches nausea like you're you could even feel like you have the flu as in keto flu restlessness
and even insulin resistance okay which i'm not going to get into too much in this video but the
point is that there's many different problems that occur when you don't have enough salt here's some
other ones loss of potassium is another one here's some other ones two when you increase aldosterone
you increase cortisol and adrenaline that's right guess what that can create insomnia there
are people that start the ketogenic diet that can't sleep and all they need is some salt okay
also this can increase blood pressure there are also people that do keto and they do all the
right things yet their blood pressure is too high they need a little salt the exact opposite of what
they think they're probably going to restrict salt and they're wondering why it won't work so
how much salt one to one and a half teaspoons per day there's a great interview that i just
did on the author from the book the salt fix i'll put it right here check it out

i want to just get your story it's just incredible i read it i literally cried so um
i just wanted to uh get it straight from you incredible story about lilliana so um
can you tell me just a little bit in your own words what what happened initially i know
uh you told you know you wrote everything out but maybe you could summarize it
sure um so liliana was seven months old when we both moved my husband and i moved to asia
to become language students and we were very happy there things were going well
liliana had been having a lot of you know crying as a young infant
right after her inoculations and so i didn't connect any dots we just kept on vaccinating and
things like that but when we got to asia things were going fine um but then we noticed directly
after her inoculation for the mmr and the typhoid um she started losing weight dramatically she lost
over six pounds in two weeks uh and she was very small she was only two and a half years old at
that time she's four now um and so uh yeah i was really concerned i took her to the pediatrician
and he misdiagnosed her with a virus without doing any testing whatsoever and gave me a um
like uh what do you call that a um uh antibiotic and i decided i just felt really weird about that
i didn't like the idea of giving her an antibiotic without knowing that it was a virus and she'd had
lots of viruses in the past but this was different it was just weird like the sudden losing weight
the constant thirst i i didn't know the signs of diabetes at all and so i didn't know what to
make but i just knew it was not a virus this is weird um but she kept on getting worse and worse
and worse we were trying to feed her and she just could not move bowels that was the most
horrible thing like to see her in that state where she was in so much pain crying and crying
and her belly was just so big and i knew she needed to get that out but she couldn't
and so finally i took her to the pediatrician again and he gave me a suppository and i'm
like um it was so horrible just doing that to her and then she she went into seizures
because it was so painful and um so she was able to pass a small bowel but still
she was just losing all that weight and um so uh the day after that um i i you know
i asked myself why now how how did i bring myself to actually go to a language lesson when she was
in that condition but i i went to my language lesson i came home um and she did not recognize me
she was just sitting on the chair like zoned out like totally glazed over
her breath was labored um i started talking to her and she like looked beyond me she wasn't
even looking at me it was just the most scary thing and she got up to walk and just collapsed
and i just panicked i was like i i don't know the doctor is not helping us with this i don't know
what this is so i took a video of her and shot it to um a really good friend of ours who lived
like super close praise god he was only like five minutes away they lived in the same neighborhood
and so he watched the video immediately he was a nurse um also um american and so he he knew
you know when he saw her he knew something was awful so he rushed to our house and did a urine
analysis of her diaper keep in mind she wasn't potty trained she wasn't talking like she's a baby
but he brought whatever those little sticks are called with him and he stuck that in
her diaper and immediately said there's sugar in her diaper she has diabetes and i
i didn't even know what type 1 diabetes was you know and he was like let's get in the car we've
got to go get you know get her to the er and um my husband was sick that day he had the flu
but we we piled into the car and i was like i was so stressed and zoned i it was like
my head was just going slow motion i couldn't process anything um so praise god that
that guy the nurse our friend was able to drive us to the the um emergency room
and the doctors there in this asian country did not know how to take care of diabetes
type one so he kind of coached them through you know bringing her blood sugars down giving her a
blood sugar test um you know what other tests need to be run like that c peptide and the whole you
know gamut of tests i think you said their blood sugars were was 600 yes yes and of course me not
knowing anything about diabetes we don't have a history of that in my family i didn't realize
that that's life-threatening i didn't realize that that's called dka i didn't know anything
so when they told me that i would you know i was still zoned out i didn't know what was going on
so to me you know all you know them sticking her with different things and it was just so traumatic
i almost passed out like watching her go through that kind of trauma and she's screaming and
you know like i can't even talk about it without i could imagine i could imagine
then you what happened is um you probably got the blood sugars under control and the
foods the doctors recommending were just all carb and uh you're kind of like what's going on yes yes
uh there in the hospital she was hospitalized for 10 days during that time the nurses would
come in and give her the shots the the insulin and then give her this bowl of rice with chicken
you know and a little bit of you know sugary tea or something and and i you know i
i really trusted doctors i trusted people that said they knew how to take care of diseases and so
you know we fed it to her and then her her blood sugars would shoot through the roof
and this went on for a couple months of course we were discharged we came home we had to move
back to the states all that happened and her her endocrinologist here in the states was telling us
the same thing give her everything she's already used to eating you know and she was eating normal
kid food like the animal crackers and cheerios and sugar bombs and ice cream and cookies and crackers
pancakes and syrup and all that good stuff and so we it was i was literally in tears every day
like i would check her blood sugars and they would be 400 500 you know a couple hours after eating or
even in the middle of the night you know because it was literally a roller coaster so i became so
desperate and stressed out with this pattern i lost my trust in the medical establishment i
thought this is not working it's just not managing this disease and um so i found your channel
and that i can say that was a a um a direct answer to my husband and my prayers um
yeah we were begging god daily like give either a cure or a way to manage this thing like to help
our child not to have complications because i was reading scary articles i was seeing articles like
if it's not managed what's going to happen when she gets 30 40 50 years old right blindness the
neuropathy all that stuff and it scared me sure so yeah so we we started looking i was looking like
day and night and searching and i put in cure for diabetes type one in my search and somehow one of
your videos popped up it wasn't a cure there is no cure that we know but wow um you were talking
about i think you were talking about a cure for type 2 actually the ketone intermittent fasting
and so i watched that and i was like well if it can do that for type 2 let's give it a shot
and so she's been now in ketosis for over probably close to a year at this point i i've lost track a
little bit but she's doing great and you're you're you're even going to the doctor saying what about
this ketogenic diet and they probably weren't they weren't supporting it yeah no they still they're
still kind of skeptical but at first they were telling us oh you're gonna cause seizures you're
gonna you know her brain is gonna go downhill her cognitive function is gonna be just zero
and all this scary stuff but after i watched and watched and watched every day i was watching your
videos and i that gave me the confidence to say to the doctor this is the diet we decided to do
and we believe our child is going to be okay we think it's going to be good for her and they
said okay well just do it you know you'll you'll talk to us later you'll be sorry and all kinds of
things but but it you know that never happened she's only improved since starting this diet
and even her a1c right has come way down yeah it's come way down yeah and then her blood sugars
what's her blood sugars running um let's see when she gets up in the morning it's around 110
maybe 90 to 110 somewhere in there that's that's a lot better than 600 yeah
yeah it's still hard to manage sometimes because she is a child she can't do it by herself so it's
me and my husband are doing it for her she does wear a pump and a cgm um you know which is helpful
really helpful and she's the the cutest thing i've ever seen she's so cute yeah she's sitting
here i told her we were going to talk to you and she was really excited oh i've got i've
got your keto shake that she drinks here every day here she is oh dr Berg that is so awesome
hey that looks familiar i've seen that before yeah so here it is we love it oh wow
every day i even put fresh kale in with it and mix it up with a little extra chocolate in there
oh that's awesome yeah low low carb of course so um so she she even watches some of the videos
and learning some of the organs and she loves your videos she she memorized parts of them wow
when you start going into your ad about you know like the the the little ad at the end she's like
quoting it with you because you say that same ad after every single video that's so cute oh she's
so adorable and uh so she's four and a half right now right yeah and she has she's like what second
grade level reading yes yes she's been reading for a year now oh my goodness
wow so she i i think i i attribute the cognitive function to the keto
and she's not doing intermittent fasting of course she's too little for that but yeah just
yeah her brain function went up dramatically absolutely i've been shocked because i'm not like
we're not even doing official homeschooling yet this is like four years old wow yeah so amazing
yeah because see the key you get that um like even our granddaughter lucy we she's doing keto
not intermittent fasting and she's she's developed a very fast rate cognitive skills sharp i mean her
mood's up i mean it's just a normal child right i've heard you talk about her yeah yeah so this

we're going to talk about a hiatal hernia what to do the best home treatment i have
done another video on this but it's hard to find so i wanted to create another one with
some additional information what are the symptoms indigestion heartburn bloating feeling nauseous
shortness of breath anxiety heart rhythm problems panic attacks and belching what is a hiatal hernia
well the stomach should be underneath the diaphragm okay which is right here the diaphragm
is a muscle that allows you to breathe but what happens with this hiatal hernia is the gap
between the esophagus and the stomach becomes slightly bigger and so then the stomach starts
to bulge up into this area right here and this right here there's a lot of nerves involved this
can trigger problems with the heart the lung the stomach all sorts of issues okay so i'm going to
show you a very very simple thing to do a simple technique okay and it's basically acupressure
what you're going to do you can take a device like this the longer end and you can press up in
to both sides so i'm going to demonstrate this here so my diaphragm is right here you don't want
to press right in the center okay because there's a little the bottom of the sternum is called the
xiphoid and this little piece of cartilage you don't want to press right there you want to go
right to the right of it a little down and you want to press in and up okay so you're trying to
you're actually stretching this you're taking the spasm out of it because there's a there's
some tightness in there it's like a charlie horse and you can just press up in there on one side
and hold or the other side you press up and hold on that side you can also use your thumb
if you take your thumb and press just to the side up into this stomach area and you press in and
up okay and you just hold this and you can even like stretch backwards and you're just
kind of creating more space in the area you don't have to necessarily worry about how
much pressure because you're doing it and you're controlling it so you can adjust that very easily
of course you're not going to you know use a knife like this but you can take your thumb you come up
in there and you just hold that until it releases and then do the other side right here okay
so you want to do that you know three times a day um if you need to and what you're going
to notice is you're going to experience a lot of relief in fact i want you to comment down
below if you do experience relief and tell me about it i'm going to read the comments
but what you're doing is you're kind of taking this congestion in getting rid of the congestion
you're allowing the food to kind of flow better through this area so you want to push in and up
to the left side and the right side now i would also recommend also going to the right
more up underneath the right ribcage and maybe a little bit down in this whole area right here
and do the left side as well okay why because there's usually not just one problem going on
there's usually a combination of things so we have the stomach but then we on the right side we have
the gallbladder and the bile ducts the left side we have the pancreas and there's also little tubes
and ducts on this side too so if it's pain more painful the left that's more of a pancreatic issue
there's more issue on the right is more of a gallbladder issue
so the remedy that you normally should have with a gallbladder is purified bile salts and
the remedy for a pancreas would just be a complex of enzymes an enzyme type supplement to help that
of course ideally the thing to do is get your diet corrected and if you're new to my channel
i put a link down below of exactly what to eat betaine hydrochloride this is a natural acidifier
very beneficial to help the stomach have more acid to digest the food which will then release
a lot of these symptoms so this is a more of a corrective thing over time you'll find
that you'll have less issue with this hernia also intermittent fasting is going to be very
beneficial because if you're eating a lot of snacks and overeating and eating frequently that
food doesn't quite get through this area too well and it can back up and cause a lot of problems so
the combination of these three things are going to be very very beneficial to actually resolving this
even if you had to do this technique three times a day that's better than having surgery which is the
alternative or getting on some medications and if you have like heartburn for example
and they put you in an antacid well what's going to happen it's going to take the acid
out of this area and you may find that every time you do it you might feel better and then worse
because usually this situation is a low stomach acid to begin with so the best thing to do is to
acidify it unless there is an ulcer but go ahead and try this right now and comment down below

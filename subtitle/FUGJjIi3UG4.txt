so we're going to talk about how stress can actually make you fat
okay now I've had some diabetics tests or blood sugars when they go through
stress and it definitely increases the blood sugar so let's talk about why so
the body's response to stress is it spikes cortisol so it will also elevate
adrenaline now cortisol another name for it is glucocorticoid okay so it has
something to do with glucose it has the potential to significantly raise your
blood sugars so here you are you're on the ketogenic diet you're not eating any
carbs you're even fasting and your blood glucose goes up because you're stressed
interesting also trauma will do it too I remember when I was riding my bike and
my chain locked up I went to over the handlebars on the cement going 30 miles
an hour next thing you know I'm laying there in a state of shock and you know I
was like craving sweets like crazy and incredibly thirsty because my blood
sugar you know went up and then insulin kicked in it went right down I end up
with like low blood sugar I was like what's happening here
so cortisol will raise your blood sugars significantly it will also
release glucose from your liver okay so we have this stored sugar in the liver
it can dump the stored sugar when you're under stress so it ends up in your
bloodstream right so then insulin has to come in and take it and put it it's into
storage also it deaminates what does that mean deaminates well there's a
little word in there emanate which has to do with amino acids it basically
takes apart amino acids it breaks down protein and it turns it into glucose
it's called gluconeogenesis the creation of new glucose from something else it
could be from ketones it could be from fat it could be from protein but with
cortisol it will tend to break down your proteins
this is why women specifically after menopause get atrophy they start losing
their muscle mass when they get older and it just turns into fat and then the
blood glucose goes up so it's not a good situation also cortisol decreases
insulin sensitivity and this is what will lead to insulin resistance which
will then cause the body to make more insulin to make more fat to make a
slower metabolism it's a vicious cycle also cortisol will drive the storage of
fat to your midsection or to your viscera around the organs in the
midsection and the liver so this is why people that have a lot of stress end up
with midsection weight skinny legs because the body is extracting and
breaking their protein from the thigh muscle the quadricep and the gluteal
muscles in your butt and it turns that into sugar and then to convert it to fat
around your midsection so now you know the mechanism between stress and belly
fat if you have not seen my main video on stress I put it right here check it out

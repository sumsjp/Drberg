i thought that fasting is supposed to give you a lot of energy
right why am i fatigued someone mentioned that in the comments section
of one of my youtube videos i'm going to explain
why that is there's actually only two reasons so if you're tired while you're
doing fasting these are the two reasons very very
simple fasting and doing keto is supposed to
take you from burning sugar stored sugar it's called
glycogen over here to fat burning where you're
burning fatty acids and you're burning ketones okay so that's the goal here
most people have a lot more of this to burn and when you fully
are adapted to ketosis you're supposed to feel good
have tons of energy but if you don't it could be you're not at a full fat
burning capacity okay realize the conversion from here to
here takes between three to seven days so if
it's the second day and you're wondering why i don't have
energy well that's just because you haven't converted over yet
to do this as fast as possible you need to keep your carbs low if
you're trying to convert over but your carbs are too high
you'll never get there so the carbs have to be down there at least below
i'd say 40 grams per day some people say 50 grams a day but
sometimes if you have severe insulin resistance it could has to be below
20 grams a day or less to speed things up
so the carbs have to be low fasting even though it's not necessary i always
recommend it because that'll speed things
up especially if you're doing snacks for the day keto bombs
so-called things that are friendly but you have very
severe insulin resistance it's going to take a long time
okay so carbs low fast two meals a day even better yet one meal
a day if you could do it but these two should get you over here
relatively fast now if you have severe insulin resistance
it could actually be a little bit longer and
you may need to in the meantime to jump start things
actually just take things that can give you ketones right away
just to make things a little bit smoother so you could add some mct oil
a tablespoon once in the morning once in the evening
should do it and then you'll start having energy right away because you're
having ketones there to supply the brain and the tissues you can also
take something called exogenous ketones which are called ketone
salts you can buy those and take those and you should start having energy
this is one reason right here you haven't given enough time
usually the other reason is this in order for
the ketones or fatty acids to be burned in the energy factory called the
mitochondria it needs helper nutrients they're called
cofactors and that would include vitamin b5
b6 b1 potassium sodium and i forgot one magnesium
okay so you need a combination of the b vitamins and you need minerals those two
right here and if you're deficient in these
going into this keto program you may find you have what's called keto fatigue
but it's very simple nutritional yeast a good mineral blend will give you
energy almost within hours so i just wanted to
point out if you're tired doing intermittent
fasting it's going to be either this process right here
or you need some cofactors to make this work
all right thanks for watching

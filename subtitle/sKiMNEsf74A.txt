I want to do a quick video on a question that I got recently on asking me what type of cracker
can I consume right well there's a lot of crackers out there but the best cracker that I'm going to
recommend on a ketogenic diet is the Finn crisp thin rye crisp bread okay so this cracker I don't
know exactly where you're going to find it maybe help the store online Amazon but it's
a whole grain rye very small amounts of gluten so if you're gluten sensitive it might not be
an option but it has a smaller amount than other crackers but look at the total carbs
is 5 grams per slice okay fiber is one gram so we minus those and we get the net carb of four
grams so that's not too bad so you can add the sour cream the cheese the brie cheese I like to
add that guacamole humus and so if you wanted a cracker this is the one I'm going to recommend
in small amounts I think it's going to be totally ok thanks for watching hey you probably already

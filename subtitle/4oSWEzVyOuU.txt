let's talk about how to prevent headaches if you're flying an airplane in fact 1 out of 12
people experience headaches when they're flying there are certain things that occur in the brain
you have increase of something called prostaglandins that's a compound that increases
when you have inflammation and in fact aspirin works by inhibiting uh prostaglandins and when
you have more prostaglandins you have an expansion of your blood vessels in the brain and that's what
causes the pain in your head so these headaches occur from two situations number one you have
this change in pressure when you take off and when you land okay that's number one and that affects
uh the sinus cavities and number two you get this spike in cortisol okay so the cortisol can also
produce headaches and anxiety so we have cortisol then we have this change in pressure which affects
the sinus cavities okay so what can you do so the most important thing to do is to completely relax
when you fly there's a very interesting video that i think you should watch if you have a
problem relaxing and i'll put that link down below where you actively cause the different
parts of your body just to relax more and more and more so you don't get on the plane being all
really tense and stressed out another point to acknowledge is that the statistics
for deaths when you're on a flight are majorly less than the statistics when
you are in car accidents and you die so if we did a comparison on the stats of flying
there's a .07 deaths per 1 billion miles okay a flight now if we compare that to cars
that's seven deaths per billion miles so you can see there's a significant difference and it's much
much safer flying than riding in a car all right motorcycle accidents we have 212.6 deaths per 1
billion miles okay so that's much higher than cars so overall if you're flying versus driving a car
and you want to look at the percentage of dying when you're in an accident from flying it's one
in ten thousand and driving in a car it's one in 114 chance of dying when you're in an accident
so again that might help reduce your stress and put you at ease hopefully maybe not maybe another
thing you should do is take adaptogens i put a link down below of a good one that i recommend
these are herbal things that help you relax and the other thing is to do controlled breathing
whether your inhalation or exhalation is too short or too long you want to even these out so you're
breathing in just as much as you're breathing out that can really help calm you down and the other
thing to do is start fasting because when you're fasting you actually pull yourself out of the
fight mode and that can help you so don't eat frequent meals don't eat sugar don't eat the
snacks because that's going to also dehydrate you so you want to do fasting through the
whole flight which will definitely strengthen you and make you feel better mood wise with
enough fluids with electrolytes to prevent dehydration which can then also
cause a headache so these are just a few tips that you can use but also watch the video on relaxation
i think that can help you greatly hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

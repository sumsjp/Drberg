hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about postponing
early death part three the third in the series now the first video we talked
about the dangerous of too much insulin right second we talked about the dangers
of too much estrogen okay now the third one see if you can guess it literally
causes diabetes dementia high cholesterol high blood pressure
osteoporosis and autoimmune diseases can you guess what this is too much cortisol
cortisol is a stress hormone okay if it's too high it creates a lot of
problems for people okay so this is stress induced so what happens when you
have too much cortisol it breaks down protein muscle protein and it turns into
sugar which then caused the diabetes it sucks up the oxygen out of your brain it
literally starves your brain of oxygen okay that's what stress does all this
sugar that's being generated from the muscle protein then turns and converted
to cholesterol even if your diet is good okay and also from the stress it
actually messes up the called neurotransmitters and then you have
problems with your blood pressure so your like adrenaline starts kicking in
too high you get this blood pressure effect too because cortisol triggers
drilling okay osteoporosis basically you have a lot of protein in your bone and
you also have minerals well cortisol or stress will deplete both protein and
minerals out of your bone and also controls the immune system so you can
have all sorts of autoimmune issues right and that's going to decrease your
lifespan as well so in this next part let's just show you how to lower
cortisol okay so here's a few things you could do to lower cortisol number one
get more sleep go to bed a little earlier sleep in or just take a nap okay
more sleep is going to then rejuvenate the adrenals and then that's going to
help lower the stress long walks walking is the best thing for
Adrina why because it's lots of oxygen low stress how long at least an hour a
day it's going to help you now some of you are doing fine doing fine with
harder exercise that's totally fine you can increase the intensity and do that
every day but but exercise tends to deplete stress in our bodies
personally I have to exercise every single day just to get the stress out
because I just crave workouts like my body demands it avoid stressful
relationships okay if you're having friends or a family member or someone
from work that's stressing you out avoid them find you know new relationships you
know get new parents or kids you know adopt new kids and I'm just being
sarcastic but you're going to have to change the
people the relationships around you and be more in control that because that's
probably the number one thing that really gets people and then also be
vitamins try to get these natural version get a nutritional yeast that has
the natural B's because b vitamins are depleted with stress and when you
increase the B vitamins you lower cortisol okay so those are some tips so
in summary we talked about what to do with insulin estrogen and now cortisol
the three killers now your body makes all three of these hormones the problem
is that's the excess that we don't need but I'm telling you if you manage these
three things you should be able to increase your lifespan all right

recently someone wanted to know my opinion of noom okay what is noom well it's a weight loss
app and then their website um they describe their program as an anti-diet habit and behavior
program no food is off limits their main focus is on calories okay you eat less calorie rich foods
and you lose weight they also have a rating scale with different color foods and with the emphasis
on eating more green foods like salads because they're less calorie and more nutrient dense
now the whole idea the whole concept is that you're going to increase your awareness if
you're tracking your calories and you may lose some weight if you eat less junk food but here's
the problems with noom the first time you do it it may work ask any female over the age of 50
that has done a lot of diets in your life and they will always tell you the same thing the first
time they went on a low calorie diet it worked and then each time they repeated that low calorie diet
it worked less and less and less and less to the point where it stopped working why because
diets in general specifically low calorie diets or low fat diets end up slowing your metabolism
because your body is adapting to a lower amount of calories so my opinion of noom it's a gimmick
it's not a long-term healthy lifestyle because what are you going to do you're going to do this
your whole life you're going to be tracking your calories or are you going to just do it until you
lose your weight go back to your other program gain the weight back and then start over again
so that's a big problem also they're assuming that all these calories that are being tracked
are treated the same by your endocrine system or your hormones and that is absolutely not
true there's one very important hormone it's called insulin that controls whether you burn
fat or not if insulin is higher than it should be you will not burn fat in fact you're going to
only store fat if insulin is lower your body will then burn fat so i think it'd be really important
instead of focusing on calories focusing on foods that stimulate or inhibit
insulin that would be a way better strategy to help you lose weight and it just so happens
that the calorie-rich foods the fats have a near-zero effect on insulin carbohydrates
have the highest effect on insulin with proteins having a moderate effect on insulin so what does
this tell us you should be in a higher fat moderate protein low carb diet we call that a
ketogenic diet now the other thing is when you're aging your metabolism is slowing down so count
your calories is not going to work especially when you have no food that is off limits because you're
allowing any foods including the carbohydrates in a certain amount also they allow snacking
and what happens anytime you eat anything you're going to get a little spike in insulin so if
you're snacking through the day and you keep that insulin high not only is that going to slow down
your weight loss but you're going to be hungry all the time so very simply you want to lower
your carbs that's going to decrease insulin your body is going to start burning fat it's going to
turn into ketones okay and then combine that with intermittent fasting if you haven't heard about
keto and intermittent fasting using those together you definitely need to know about that because
it's going to make your weight loss program not only a lot more effective but a lot easier
because your hunger is going to go away you'll get into fat burning more consistently and more long
term and you won't have to count your calories or track your calories at all so you have a lot more
extra time on your hands so i put those links down below but let's go ahead and show you some of the
results that you can get when you do healthy keto in intermittent fasting check this out

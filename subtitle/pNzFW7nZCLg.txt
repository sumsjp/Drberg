you know here you are you give up sugar and you're doing all the right things but you're still
craving carbs late at night what's up with that well i stumbled on a research paper that is
very interesting because sweet cravings could come from something other than your diet and
i've done a lot of videos on this but i have never made the link between your cell phone
specifically the blue light from your cell phone but not just the smartphone you have the tablet
your computer tv anything that emits blue light so blue light apparently goes into the retina
of your eye which is an extension of your brain goes into the brain into the hypothalamus and
starts to affect your circadian rhythms the pineal gland which then interacts with your adrenal gland
and the liver and many other organs so what is the relationship between blue light and your blood
sugars well it's two things one it interferes with melatonin number one and number two it spikes
cortisol which then affects your blood sugars due to stress so both of those actions can actually
release more sugar and cause your body to make more sugar even though you're not eating sugar
and so the sugar comes up insulin comes in after pushes the blood sugar down
you end up with low blood sugars late at night after about an hour being exposed to this blue
light so if you're giving up sugar and you're doing all the right things try
this you can get an app on your computer to filter out this blue light you can actually wear glasses
that filter out the blue light because it's the exposure to the retina or you can do what
i do about two hours before i go to bed i'm not exposed to any blue lights at all or you can use
a red light which does not affect your melatonin your sleep cycles your circadian rhythm cortisol
or anything it's the blue light so give it a try and see if your cravings don't disappear so if

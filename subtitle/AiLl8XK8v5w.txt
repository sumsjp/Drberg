i want to answer the question why does weight loss sometimes increase the risk of gallstones
take a look at this your fat cell is composed of triglycerides
and cholesterol a lot of people don't realize this especially the amount if you're of a normal weight
and you're not overweight too much 25 of that fat cell is made from cholesterol but if you are obese
50 of that fat cell is going to be composed of cholesterol so when you start losing weight
this cholesterol is going to come out this is why a lot of times on the ketogenic diet
the cholesterol is higher initially because it's being dumped by the gallbladder but what you have
to realize is there's a control mechanism of this cholesterol especially to get rid of the excess
and that has to do with bile okay bile salts bile salts help control the excess of cholesterol
and it's the lack of bile that can cause a gallstone because you have this super
concentrated cholesterol without enough bile and then you get a gallstone so gallstones
are caused by a bile deficiency now if you add high insulin to this picture right here
as well as a low-fat diet so let's say someone is obese you know they're going to have high insulin
and you know in the past they probably have been on a lot of low-fat diets right well they're going
to have low amounts of bile and they're going to be at risk for getting gallstones so the solution
is to go in a diet that's low carb to reduce the insulin and take purified bile salts i have done
a lot of videos on this topic right here because bile salts are quite magical what they can do in
the body but in the gallbladder what they're going to do with fat is they're going to help break down
the fat molecules because the enzymes coming from the pancreas specifically lipase cannot break down
these globules of fat these fat compounds have to first be broken down enough so the enzyme lipase
can take effect and that's where bile comes in it's like a detergent that breaks down the grease
so now this enzyme can take it down all the way to the smallest particle so your body can absorb
it so with a bile you can't digest fat you get bloated you can't pull in the fat type of vitamins
and you can't really regulate cholesterol that well as well as increasing the risk
of gallstones the simple solution is if you are at risk for getting a gallstone let's say you
had one in the past and you're obese just take some purified bile salts that will keep you in
a situation where you can actually definitely minimize the risk for this right here hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on

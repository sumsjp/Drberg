are you finding that you're still tired after sleeping all night long this is
the video that you need to watch and it's called excessive daytime sleepiness
now what happens is when you go to bed at night there are waves of hormones
that occur and there are 90-minute cycles and there's four of them and when
you go through these waves there's different levels okay so the superficial
layer is the REM sleep it's a superficial light sleep and then you
have the Delta this is the deep sleep this is where you recharge this is the
goal is to get down here now what would prevent you from getting in the Delta
wave well of course stress will but what I want to talk about is other things
that you might not know okay number one a vitamin D deficiency if you're
deficient in vitamin D it's going to be very difficult to get into the Delta
wave so you would want to take about 20,000 IU's of vitamin D some weren't
like in the morning or maybe lunch time or you get a lot of Sun and that's
probably why your sleep cycles are much better when you get more Sun so you can
do the Sun or vitamin D so that's number one number two fermented foods like
sauerkraut there's a huge connection between your gut and your brain okay so
if the microbes have enough food and the cool thing about fermented foods is not
only does that provide fiber but also friendly microbes as well and one of the
reasons why it will do that is that the microbes actually make little proteins
that help you form neurotransmitters like serotonin gaba and those are the
things that reduce stress so your gut brain connection is very important and
then omega-3 fatty acids so many people consume too much omega-6 fatty acids
like soy oil canola corn cottonseed oil those are all inflammatory we don't have
enough omega-3 this isn't fish or cod liver oil and
then we have the EMF electromagnetic fields this is something very new to
people I'm gonna create a separate video on it
but this is huge if you're sitting in front of your computer for hours and
hours and hours you are gonna be drained of energy and
that could be the reason why you're trying to sleep and you're not being
recharged okay more on this later but I did put a link down below if you wanted
to start learning about this right here especially this cell phone and if you
have Wi-Fi going right up into those little ear phones bad idea
and number five if you have the chronic infection let's say you have a some type
of an Epstein barr virus or some low-grade infection from maybe I don't
know infection in your tooth or in some infection in your gut and that's just
been there for years this right here will keep you tired I did put together a
video on this which I'm gonna put a link down below but for this I would
recommend a natural antibiotic like oregano for example or even garlic
that's really good to wipe out these chronic infections and with chronic
infections like you're always tired regardless of how much sleep you have
and you're taking all these vitamins you're not seeing any change because
there's an immune reaction and immune reactions spike histamines so if you
suspect having that check out the video down below alright thanks for watching

i wanted to create a short video on another trigger to migraines when i was in practice
i saw this all the time there were people that had headaches that are drinking a lot of coffee
and they didn't connect the dots so i wanted to include the list just to make sure that you're
aware that caffeine is definitely a trigger to migraines 87 of americans drink coffee with an
average amount of caffeine of 164 milligrams every single day and there's an interesting study that
i'm going to put down below that demonstrates two or more caffeinated beverages per day can
trigger migraines three to four servings of caffeinated beverages will increase it by 1.5
times and 5 servings of a caffeinated beverage will increase your chance of getting migraine by
2x now when we talk about migraines it's a very complex topic because no one really
knows exactly what causes migraines they have theories we do know the triggers can be
weather could be sleep stress low blood sugars loud noises bright lights but from working with
quite a few people over many years i narrowed down some really good remedies to help people with
headaches i'm just going to include this one at the top decrease caffeine i would actually
completely eliminate caffeine from your diet and you're going to find that after about two weeks
when there's no more withdrawal symptoms you may find your migraines are completely gone all right
number two a magnesium deficiency can actually set you up for migraines so take more magnesium
number three if you don't already know this a ketogenic diet will usually greatly reduce if not
completely eliminate migraines simply because your brain loves ketones and when you make the switch
all sorts of wonderful things happen to your brain so get on a ketogenic diet low carb if you're new
to my channel i put a link down below number four if you have low sodium that can trigger a migraine
i did an entire video on that one topic i put the link down below check it out and so with this i
would recommend taking like about eighth of a teaspoon of salt dissolve it in some water and
drink that several times a day that seems to work really nicely especially if you have a pattern of
migraines that happen every so often and you can predict when they come you can drink this salt
water before it occurs and hopefully suppress a migraine number five is very very common
so many people have gallbladder issues and there's a nerve from the diaphragm right on top of where
the gallbladder is that goes all the way up to your neck and it can refer pain up into the head
on the right side so if your migraine is on the right side or you have headaches on the right side
suspect gallbladder and you need to obviously change your diet
but one real simple cool thing you can do is just massage the gallbladder underneath your right rib
cage it's probably going to be very swollen and congested and just notice if your headache or
migraine goes away in which case if it does then we know there's a connection and now you need to
watch the videos that i have on the gallbladder i'll put some links down below but it's called
the phrenic nerve and anything on the right side shoulder arm the whole thing check the gallbladder
number six if you get migraines that time of the month it's usually related to estrogen your
estrogen dominance so there's a whole protocol for that i put a link down below you're gonna
probably need to take some iodine or seek help better yet or something called dim which is a
concentrated cruciferous type product that can help regulate excessive amounts of estrogen all
right there you have it this is the complete list thanks for watching before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by
to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

### Key Points and Sections of the Article

#### 1. **Core Theme: The Rising Epidemic of Autoimmune Diseases**
- Autoimmune diseases affect approximately one in every 12 individuals, with a higher prevalence among women (one in nine).
- The incidence of autoimmune diseases has significantly increased since the 1950s and 1960s.

#### 2. **Main Concepts: Understanding Autoimmune Diseases**
- The immune system's primary function is to differentiate self-cells from external pathogens, maintaining tolerance for the body's own cells.
- Inflammation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues.

#### 3. **Underlying Causes of Autoimmune Diseases**
- **Intestinal Permeability (Leaky Gut):** The small intestine, responsible for 90% of digestion, has a single-cell layer that allows controlled absorption. Damage to this barrier (leaky gut) permits harmful substances into the bloodstream, triggering immune responses and inflammation.
- **Environmental Toxins:** A study found 287 industrial chemicals in fetal cord blood, including plastics, pesticides, and flame retardants.
- **Dietary Factors:**
  - Gluten is a major trigger for autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Celiac disease.
  - Glyphosate (active ingredient in RoundUp) use on wheat, corn, soy, cottonseed, and canola has been linked to leaky gut and microbiome disruption.
- **Seed Oils:** Increased consumption of seed oils (e.g., soybean, canola) correlates with rising autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation.
- **Stress:** Cortisol, released during stress, suppresses immune function, often preceding the onset of autoimmune conditions.

#### 4. **Solutions and Health Recommendations**
- **Dietary Adjustments:**
  - **Ketogenic Diet:** Prioritize high-quality animal proteins and fats, avoiding grains.
  - **Vegetable Intake:** Consume cooked vegetables; avoid raw ones due to potential fiber-induced gut irritation.
  - **Fermented Vegetables:** Include moderate amounts of sauerkraut, kimchi, or pickles to support microbiome health.
- **Supplements:**
  - **Vitamin D:** Supplementation between 30,000â€“50,000 IU/day is recommended for a period.
  - **L-Glutamine:** Supports gut healing and can be obtained from red meat or supplements.
  - **Colostrum:** Use small amounts due to potential milk protein allergies; it offers immune benefits.

#### 5. **Conclusion: Addressing Autoimmune Diseases Holistically**
- A combination of dietary changes, supplementation, and stress management is essential for managing and reversing autoimmune conditions.
- Emphasize the importance of a clean diet rich in high-quality proteins and fats, avoiding harmful toxins and inflammatory foods.

This structured approach highlights the critical factors contributing to autoimmune diseases and provides actionable strategies for improvement.

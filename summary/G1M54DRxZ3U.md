  - **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**: Increase intake of vitamin B1 to support the parasympathetic nervous system.
  - **Physical Activities**: Engage in low-stress exercises like walking, yoga, or stretching to promote relaxation.

#### Conclusion:
- Cigarette smoking is driven by the desire for stress relief and relaxation, but it comes with significant health risks due to harmful chemicals. Transitioning to safer nicotine delivery methods and adopting natural strategies to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system can help achieve similar benefits without the associated dangers.

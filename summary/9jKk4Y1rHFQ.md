### 1. Core Theme (核心主題)
- Correction of a Short Leg and Its Underlying Mechanisms (短腿的矯正及其作用機制)

### 2. Key Concepts (主要觀念)
- **Short Leg Phenomenon**: A common issue where one leg appears shorter than the other.
- **Pelvic Misalignment**: The primary cause of the apparent short leg, often due to muscle spasms or falls affecting the pelvis.
- **Muscle Involvement**: Focus on the Quadratus Lumborum (QL) muscles, which connect the lower ribs to the pelvic bones and play a significant role in maintaining posture.

### 3. Problem Analysis (問題原因)
- **Quadratus Lumborum Spasm**: A tight or spasmed QL muscle can pull the pelvis upward on one side, creating an illusion of a short leg.
- **Trauma or Injury**: Falls onto the tailbone, buttocks, or knees can cause muscle spasms that lead to pelvic misalignment.
- **Incorrect Interventions**: Using heel lifts on the perceived shorter leg can exacerbate the issue by driving the pelvis higher.

### 4. Solution Methodology (解決方法)
- **Avoid Heel Lifts**: Do not use heel lifts on the short leg as it may worsen the condition by further elevating the pelvis.
- **Target Opposite Muscle Group**: Stretching the opposite, longer leg can help relax the tight muscles on the shorter side due to their interconnected electrical circuits (muscle synergy).
- **Stretching Technique**:
  - Place the individual in a prone position.
  - Instruct them to push their pelvis downward towards the ground while stretching the long leg.
  - Repeat this exercise 10 times to achieve relaxation and balance.

### 5. Health Recommendations (健康建議)
- **Self-Assessment**: Identify which leg is shorter with someone's assistance.
- **Consistency**: Perform the stretching exercise regularly as directed by a healthcare professional.
- **Avoid Trauma**: Be cautious of falls or injuries that could cause muscle spasms affecting pelvic alignment.

### 6. Conclusion (結論)
- The short leg issue is primarily due to pelvic misalignment caused by Quadratus Lumborum muscle spasms.
- Correcting the issue involves targeting the opposite muscle group through controlled stretching rather than directly addressing the apparent shorter leg.
- Early intervention and proper techniques can lead to significant improvement in leg alignment and overall posture.

This structured approach provides a clear understanding of the problem, its causes, and effective solutions, emphasizing the importance of targeted muscle relaxation techniques for correcting short legs.

   - Certain medications (e.g., Lipitor) caused severe side effects like numbness, nausea, diarrhea, and lethargy, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment plans.

4. **Stress and Its Influence on Blood Sugar Levels**:
   - High stress levels increased cortisol production, leading to elevated blood sugar levels despite a clean diet.

5. **Role of Sleep in Recovery**:
   - Poor sleep quality from shift work negatively impacted overall health, including blood sugar stability and recovery from injuries like plantar fasciitis.

6. **Impact of Diet on Blood Sugar and Overall Health**:
   - A diet rich in vegetables, low in carbohydrates, and free from processed foods significantly improved blood sugar control and overall metabolic health.

7. **Exercise and Recovery**:
   - Interval training and consistent exercise improved energy levels, cardiovascular health, and recovery from chronic injuries.

### 核心主題：  
- **重要性**：Potassium is a critical mineral for maintaining cellular function, particularly in energy storage and glycogen synthesis.  
- **缺乏影響**：Deficiency in potassium can lead to severe health issues, including low blood sugar, fluid retention, and metabolic disorders.

### 主要觀念：  
1. **功能**：Potassium plays a vital role in storing glycogen, which is essential for energy production in the body.  
2. **現代飲食的影響**：The modern diet, particularly ultra-processed foods, is low in potassium and high in sodium, contributing to widespread deficiencies.  
3. **健康問題**：Chronic potassium deficiency can result in conditions such as fluid retention, edema, and increased reliance on medications like diuretics and blood pressure drugs.

### 問題原因：  
1. **飲食因素**：  
   - High intake of ultra-processed foods (e.g., Doritos) that are nutrient-depleted and high in sodium.  
   - Low consumption of potassium-rich foods, such as leafy greens and berries.  
2. **藥物影響**：  
   - Use of diuretics, steroids, and antibiotics like penicillin can deplete potassium levels.  
3. **生活習慣**：  
   - Chronic stress and high-carb diets increase insulin levels, leading to potassium loss.  
   - Prolonged fasting or rapid refeeding (e.g., after a ketogenic diet) without proper electrolyte intake can cause severe potassium deficiency.

### 解決方法：  
1. **飲食調整**：  
   - Increase consumption of potassium-rich foods, such as leafy greens (kale, spinach), berries, and other fruits.  
   - Experiment with blended smoothies to incorporate high-potassium foods into the diet.  
2. **補充劑**：  
   - Consider potassium supplements, especially when following low-carb diets like keto or during periods of fasting.  
3. **生活習慣 modification**：  
   - Avoid excessive intake of ultra-processed foods and reduce sodium consumption.  
   - Manage stress and maintain a balanced diet to prevent insulin spikes and subsequent potassium loss.

### 健康建議：  
1. **飲食計劃**：Start incorporating more high-potassium foods into your meals, such as leafy greens, berries, and vegetables.  
2. **補充劑的使用**：If dietary intake is insufficient, consider adding a potassium supplement to maintain healthy levels.  
3. **生活方式的改變**：Reduce reliance on processed foods, manage stress, and monitor electrolyte balance during fasting or dieting.

### 結論：  
- Potassium is essential for cellular energy storage and overall health.  
- Modern dietary habits, particularly the consumption of ultra-processed foods, contribute to widespread potassium deficiency.  
- Addressing this issue through dietary changes and supplements can significantly improve health outcomes and reduce reliance on medications.

### 研究數據和統計數字（英文表示）：  
- **Ultra-Processed Food Consumption**: 60% of calories in the U.S. diet come from ultra-processed foods.  
- **Sodium Intake**: Fast food restaurants provide high-sodium, nutrient-depleted foods contributing to potassium deficiency.  
- **Refeeding Syndrome Risk**: Prolonged fasting followed by rapid carbohydrate intake can cause severe potassium deficiency.

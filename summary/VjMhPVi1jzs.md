#### 核心主題： adrenal fatigue and its implications on physical and mental health.

1. **Definition of Adrenal Fatigue**:
   - The article discusses the concept of adrenal fatigue, which occurs when the adrenal glands become overburdened due to prolonged stress.
   - This condition leads to a depletion of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, resulting in various physical and psychological symptoms.

2. **Symptoms of Adrenal Fatigue**:
   - Common symptoms include excessive thinking or analysis, difficulty turning off the mind, irritability, and feeling overwhelmed.
   - These symptoms are often triggered by chronic stressors such as work pressures, financial concerns, relationship issues, and environmental stressors.

3. **Physiological Mechanism**:
   - The adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which are crucial for the body's response to stress (fight-or-flight mechanism).
   - Chronic activation of this mechanism can lead to hormonal imbalances and exhaustion of the adrenal system.

4. **Diagnosis**:
   - A simple test involving measuring blood pressure while lying down and standing up can provide insights into adrenal function.
   - A normal increase in blood pressure upon standing (6-10 points) indicates healthy adrenal function; a lower increase suggests adrenal fatigue.

5. **Health Recommendations**:
   - Engaging in activities that create mental space, such as going for a walk or hike, can help reduce stress and support adrenal health.
   - Avoiding excessive screen time and mentally taxing environments during periods of stress is recommended.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Adrenal fatigue is a significant issue in modern society due to the prevalence of chronic stress.
   - By understanding the symptoms, mechanisms, and simple interventions, individuals can take proactive steps to maintain their health and well-being.

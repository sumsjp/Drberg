### Key Points and Summary of the Article  

#### 1. **Core Theme: Tuberculosis (TB) as a Global Health Issue**  
- **Definition**: Tuberculosis is caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  
- **Magnitude**: TB kills approximately 1.8 million people annually worldwide.  
- **Prevalence**: About 25% of the global population has been infected with TB, mostly in its latent (dormant) form.  

#### 2. **Forms of Tuberculosis**  
- **Active Infection**: Symptoms include chronic cough, blood-tinged sputum, fever, back pain, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. It typically takes 8-10 weeks for TB to be detectable.  
- **Latent Infection**: Asymptomatic with no active disease but can progress to active TB under certain conditions.  

#### 3. **Risk Factors for Active TB**  
- **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Low vitamin D levels increase the risk of active TB by five times due to its critical role in immune system regulation.  
- **Genetic Polymorphism**: A genetic defect in the vitamin D receptor increases susceptibility to TB.  
- **Stress and Cortisol**: High cortisol levels from stress lower vitamin D and impair immune function, increasing vulnerability to TB.  
- **Age**: Older adults have reduced vitamin D levels and weakened immune systems.  
- **Chemotherapy and Steroids**: These treatments suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to active TB.  

#### 4. **Pathophysiology**  
- **Immune System Regulation**: Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, particularly against infections like TB.  
- **Cortisol Effects**: Stress-induced cortisol not only lowers vitamin D but also paralyzes the immune system, making individuals more prone to infections.  

#### 5. **Preventive and Therapeutic Strategies**  
- **Vitamin D Supplementation**:  
  - Maintenance dose: 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily.  
  - Higher doses (30-40,000 IU) for individuals with TB or compromised immune systems.  
- **Sun Exposure**: Regular sun exposure is crucial for natural vitamin D synthesis and overall immune health.  
- **Addressing Stress**: Managing stress through psychological support and lifestyle modifications to reduce cortisol levels.  

#### 6. **Health Recommendations**  
- **Diet and Nutrition**: Ensure adequate intake of vitamin D-rich foods (e.g., fatty fish, fortified dairy products).  
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Incorporate relaxation techniques, exercise, and sufficient sleep to manage stress effectively.  
- **Medical Check-ups**: Regular monitoring of vitamin D levels, especially for high-risk populations.  

#### 7. **Conclusion**  
- Tuberculosis remains a significant global health challenge, with both active and latent forms requiring attention.  
- Addressing vitamin D deficiency through supplementation and sun exposure is critical for reducing susceptibility to TB.  
- Integrating immune-enhancing strategies, such as stress management and optimal nutrition, can significantly mitigate the risk of developing active TB.

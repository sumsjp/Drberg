### 核心主題  
- **Definition of a Stye**: A stye is a fluid-filled puss sac on the inside of the eyelid, causing significant irritation.  
- **Relation to Boils**: Similar to boils found in areas such as underarms, back, and behind knees, all resulting from bacterial or viral infections.  

### 主要觀念  
1. **Pathophysiology of Styes**:  
   - Styes arise due to infections, primarily bacterial but sometimes viral.  
   - The immune system's neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) play a crucial role in combating these infections by engulfing and eliminating pathogens.  

2. **Role of Neutrophils**:  
   - Neutrophils function as the primary defense mechanism against infections, akin to Pac-Man, by consuming bacteria.  
   - However, excessive sugar consumption can impair their functionality.  

3. **Impact of Sugar on Immunity**:  
   - High sugar intake, common in conditions like diabetes or prediabetes (including hypoglycemic insulin resistance), diverts neutrophils from fighting infections to focusing on metabolizing sugar.  
   - This diversion reduces the effectiveness of the immune response, allowing infections to persist.  

### 啟發的原因  
- **Sugar's Immunomodulatory Effect**: Excessive sugar consumption disrupts neutrophil activity, weakening the body's ability to combat infections effectively.  

### 解決方法  
1. **Dietary Modifications**:  
   - Eliminate all forms of sugars, including those found in processed foods like bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, and pancakes.  
   - Avoid consuming sugary substances such as syrup, glucose-based medications, juice, or sweetened drinks during an infection.  

2. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:  
   - Reduce snacking habits to minimize sugar intake and promote overall immune health.  

### 健康建議  
- **Balanced Diet**: Opt for low-sugar, nutrient-rich foods to support immune function.  
- **Monitor Blood Sugar Levels**: For individuals with diabetes or prediabetes, maintaining stable blood sugar levels is essential for optimal immune response.  
- **Avoid Sugary Remedies**: Refrain from using sugary medications or beverages when treating infections like styes.  

### 結論  
- **Importance of Diet in Immune Health**: Reducing sugar intake can significantly enhance the body's ability to fight infections, leading to faster recovery from conditions such as styes and boils.  
- **Practical Steps for Prevention and Recovery**: By adopting a low-sugar diet and avoiding sugary remedies, individuals can effectively manage and prevent infections related to neutrophil dysfunction.

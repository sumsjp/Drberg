are you in need of a new liver do you realize that 15 000 people in the united states are on the list
for a liver transplant now if you're in this list i want to share some information that i think
could be very beneficial to you um in the meantime as you're waiting to get your new liver now the
good news the very cool thing about the liver is that the liver cells have a huge tolerance
for injury they have a massive capacity for repairing and regrowing the liver has
some key functions one is a biochemical defense against toxic chemicals it makes certain proteins
one protein has a function of carrying cholesterol through the body another protein carries oxygen
through the blood another protein will help you clot okay so if you're bleeding the liver makes
bile it makes vitamins and it's very very important in brain health if there is liver
damage it can affect your brain it can actually cause dementia now there's three things that
destroy a liver number one inflammation number two a fatty liver number three scar tissue they
call that cirrhosis and many times you start out with a fatty liver and then you get inflammation
and then you you get scar tissue sometimes you start with inflammation and then you develop a
fatty liver and then you roll right into fibrosis and other times you might just have inflammation
and then roll right into fibrosis so there's different stages that can occur and what happens
in this process the liver starts to enlarge and when it enlarges it can cause referral pain to
your right shoulder or your neck right up through here and it can also start reducing your function
so you can't make bile and then that backs up and it creates more liver damage there's so
many things that can go wrong with the liver now the question is this at what stage can the liver
no longer recover i have had patients come in my office that were on the transplant list waiting
for a new liver that were able to regenerate their livers to a point where they didn't need to be
on that list now i'm not going to say that that is going to be your situation because you don't know
but many times when you're on the list they don't really tell you what to do
to help improve the situation to possibly reverse the damage and what we're talking about is
reducing the damage with the fat reducing the damage with the scar tissue and reducing the
inflammation of the liver but you know what it's worth a shot because the liver is highly
resilient okay it bounces back so what is the most important thing you need to know do you
change the fat in your diet do you go to a low-fat diet do you go to a high-fat diet do
you reduce your carbs do you reduce your proteins what's the most important thing you can do
it's lowering your carbohydrates okay why because all three things inflammation fatty liver
in scar tissue liver are can be created by a high carbohydrate diet so lowering your carbohydrates
is the most important thing you can do i'm going to put some links down below of some interesting
studies that show that by reducing your carbs to 20 grams per day can result in shrinking the
large liver and also reducing fat on the liver and improving the function of your liver
so that's the most important thing and if you are new to my channel
i put a link down below of the exact plan that you need to do and that is called healthy keto
with intermittent fasting you need to do them both together because
both a low carb diet and in a minute fasting can dramatically reduce the inflammation and can also
help reverse some of the scar tissue as well as take the fat off the liver going on a low carb
diet is the most important thing to remove the fat off the liver despite eating more fat in the study
that i listed down below they actually compared a low carb to a low fat diet and the low carb
significantly showed better improvements then the second thing you want to do is make sure your fats
are a little bit higher but make sure the fats are omega-3 fatty acids olive oil fats that are
high in lecithin like egg yolks that would be very smart and i would make sure that you're not
doing a lot of omega-6 fatty acids because that creates inflammation okay and it's totally okay
to do the saturated fats as long as your carbs are low now as far as protein goes you can go
um moderate protein two on the lower side okay i wouldn't do the high protein if the liver is bad
but a moderate amount of protein to something a little bit lower and in the link down below you'll
you'll learn all about that but this low carb thing is the most important thing i don't want
to beat a dead horse but just think about this for a second high carb increases more oxidative stress
it creates more inflammation it causes more conversion of those carbs to fat around your liver
it causes insulin resistance which leads to a fatty liver and the conversion of inflammation
to scar tissue or fibrosis so if you're waiting on the transplant list don't do nothing do this plan
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

let's talk about the bigger problem of chronic inflammation most people with
chronic inflammation are mainly concerned with the pain and stiffness part of that inflammation
what i want to do is increase your awareness of some bigger problems other than just the
sensation of pain and stiffness so there are four main cytokines cytokines are proteins that are
pro-inflammatory there are things in our body that cause inflammation or swelling and they're very
weird sounding names okay which we're not going to get into except for this one right here tnf
alpha stands for tumor the crosses factor alpha and the reason why they originally named it
tumor necrosis factor is because it destroys and kills cancer as one of the benefits
however there's a paradox to this it also can increase the risk of growing tumors
in certain parts of your body like in the colon and so if there's higher levels of tnf
you may prevent cancer in one part of your body in the liver for example but you may grow a tumor
in your colon and there's a lot that's unknown about this right now but whether it's increasing
a tumor or decreasing a tumor the best thing is we just want inflammation out of the body now chronic
exposure to this cytokine over time in low doses can create three different big problems
we already talked about this one right here increasing your risk of tumors and by the way
as a side note it can increase the spread of cancer cancer tends to migrate in areas
of inflammation and so this protein is involved in the spreading of cancer another thing that this
protein could do is actually trigger something called cachexia and this condition is a wasting
syndrome of your muscles and then number two depression so if you're exposed to this cytokine
or chronic inflammation you potentially can start seeing a lot of wasting of your muscles your mood
is greatly affected and now you have this risk of cancer tumors and even the spread of cancer
and those are the bigger problems of chronic inflammation now if we look at the treatment for
chronic inflammation whether it's an autoimmune disease or a chronic arthritis they use prednisone
and definitely humera which is a medication for chronic inflammation but here are some slight
minor complications when you take prednisone one of the big side effects is increased risk
of diabetes because it increases glucose in the body humera also has a potential side effect in
certain individuals of causing diabetes type 2. i'm going to put the links down below
well what's the problem with that hyperglycemia which is high sugar in the blood down regulates
certain genes that increase this cytokine so even though these two treatments inhibit this
the blood sugar issue can then start increasing this so we kind of have this intention to get
rid of this problem yet it's causing the problem well i think you already know what to do if you've
been watching my channel if you're new to my channel you want to get off the carbs go low carb
i put a link down below of how to do that it's called healthy keto
number two start on intermittent fasting one of the most powerful things you can do for dropping
inflammation number three start taking vitamin d3 in higher amounts i would recommend at least
20 000 international units per day you might even want to do 30 000 ius per day
it's one of the best vitamins for reducing inflammation and number four start to rid out
of your diet any omega-6 fatty acid that would include the soy oil the corn oil the vegetable
oils the canola the safflower the sunflower oils you can definitely do certain omega-6
oils like evening primrose or black currant seed oil or even better yet olive oil those are fine
but consuming omega-6 fatty acids are definitely inflammatory and that can trigger this and i put a
link down below of a video that i did on this right here all right thanks for watching and
i will see you in the next video before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

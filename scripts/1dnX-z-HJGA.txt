so what is the absolute best remedy for pms evening primrose oil and what is pms
it's pre-menstrual syndrome there's a problem between the time period of when you're ovulating
which is usually about day 14 to the time that you're actually having your period somewhere in
that time frame it's called the luteal phase in the menstrual cycle now pms is kind of a broad
term for about 150 different symptoms it can cause women to be irritable depressed anxiety
fatigued she can develop a headache have cravings painful inflamed breasts low libido
even a flare up of endometriosis as well as fibroids now what's happening is the circuits
between the brain and the ovary and the uterus are aberrated they're not flowing correctly there's a
bit too much of a certain hormone called prolactin which then will influence the estrogen as well but
an increase in prolactin is the main problem here it just happens that evening primrose oil
has something called gamma linolenic acid which lowers prolactin and by lowering prolactin it's
going to help estrogen levels as well and also if a woman has pms and she gets tested for prolactin
and is normal evening primrose oil can make that hormone more sensitive and reduce the pms
symptoms two other really good things to add to this would be about 10,000 IUs of
vitamin d3 as well as some extra calcium you can do calcium lactate you can do calcium
citrate but don't do calcium carbonate all right there's my recommendation for the best remedy for
pms hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you

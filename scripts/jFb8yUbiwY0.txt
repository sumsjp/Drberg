so if you're drinking tap water you might want to think twice because
it's pretty toxic especially if you live in the southern part of the united states
where there are very high levels of estrogen that can not only affect men
by shutting down their testosterone but it can also put a woman into estrogen dominance
not to mention you also have fluoride which affects the thyroid it also affects your skin and
then you have another chemical called chloramine which is a combination of chlorine and ammonia
not good for your body but here's the thing the legal dose of these chemicals that are accepted
in tap water does not mean that they're safe in any way shape or form in fact the legal limits
of these contaminants have not been evaluated for 20 years there's a very interesting website that
i'm going to put a link down below you can go to and just type in your zip code and it'll tell you
what chemicals are in your tap water and the one that i went to showed how high those chemicals are
compared to the legal dose that is recommended first one bromodichloromethane okay that's a
chemical that causes cancer it was at levels of 52 times where it should be that's crazy then
we have chloroform which is seven times more than it should be then you have halo acetic acid which
is 247 times what it should be nitrates 10 times more than it should be and then another one called
tthm which was 306 times higher than it should be four out of the five chemicals are known to cause
cancer so i have two filters i have one that filters all the chemicals but it doesn't filter
fluoride so i got another filter for fluoride and they both connect and so that's what i use
in my house so if you wanted a good company that sells filters i put a link down below i have no
affiliation i get no kickbacks or anything like that but it's one that i think that's
pretty pretty good so you can check it out hey before you go real quick i have a course

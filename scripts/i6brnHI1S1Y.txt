hey guys in this video we want to talk about the seven nutrients that can get rid of your
love handles okay now the point I want to make first is that some of this you've probably heard
in other videos but I'm emphasizing the most important thing and that has to do with what
these nutrients do not directly to the fat but to the insulin that is too high that makes the
fat in the gut if you have love handles that you have belly fat you basically have too much
insulin that's the simplicity of it so what can we do to lower insulin versus the love handles
these are the nutrients that will do it the tascam where do you get potassium from eat tops so those
beets that you buy at the grocery store that you might steam don't shoot away the tops cut
the tops up the green part and put those in your salad okay or put those in your blender I like to
freeze them so I put them in my kale shake with a little bit of fruit I'm sorry berries not actual
other fruit okay greens to salads in general and avocados very very high in potassium you need a
lot you need like four to five thousand milligrams every single day now vitamin D vitamin D will help
lower insulin cod liver oil actual liver if you like liver grass-fed Sun mushrooms okay that's
the source of your vitamin D you can also get an egg yolks things like that and then fiber from
vegetables so if you were to consume carrot juice for example which base it is the juice
without the fiber you could spike the insulin but of course the fiber in the juice and I'm sorry in
the carrot in the beet and these other vegetables buffer any type of sugar that's in there so even
with berries for example it's loaded with fiber that is going to buffer and that's why fruit is
way better than fruit juice vegetables are better than the vegetable juice because the fiber fiber
does slow down the glycemic index but also fiber can't feed the microbes in your gut
then make a certain acid that feeds the colon and that actually helps insulin resistance to
so even though I don't really consider fiber as a nutrient I just don't it might be but I just
don't see that being a nutrient especially an essential nutrient but it's it's a factor
that's in a lot of different things now also MCTS medium chain triglycerides those are at
certain types of fats that actually help lose weight and they will help you enhance the fat
burning process and you can get that from coconut oil palm oil okay next one is magnesium pumpkin
seeds are loaded with magnesium spinach Swiss chard almonds other nuts loaded with magnesium
very important and that will actually uses the foods that are to have potassium also have
magnesium so you can kill two birds with one stone a vitamin b1 will decrease the need of insulin
so again you burn up b1 when you're under stress you burn up b1 when you go through when you eat
sugar you lose b1 when you drink alcohol okay so the point is that sunflower seeds have lots
of b1 and nutritional yeast alright now we get with the chromium chromium is another good one
for lowering blood sugar issues and also improving insulin resistance broccoli has
a ton of chromium and so does nutritional yeast so chromium is a trace mineral now as you notice
think about nutritional yeast it has like all these amazing B vitamins but it also has all
these amazing trace minerals including amino acids as well so nutritional yeast hands-down
is like one of the greatest things you can consume it just it's hard to consume it because it gets in
your teeth and everything but but maybe you can mix it with some almond butter okay alright so
go ahead and make note of these apply this and share your comments below thanks for watching

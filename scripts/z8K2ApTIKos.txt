so i wanted to create this video just to talk about how much water you should drink
i had some previous videos that talked about only drinking when you're thirsty and
that could be like one cup a day but when you're fasting you need to be drinking
more water than when you're not fasting and the reason for that is that you're losing
a good amount of your glycogen especially if you're fasting over a period of time you're
doing prolonged fasting 48 72 hours you're going to lose your glycogen and with the glycogen loss
which is your stored sugar you're also going to lose a ton of fluid and i say fluid because it's
not just water it's a combination of water and electrolytes and salts so you need to put that
back so the amount of water that i'm going to recommend is between two to three liters a day
and this will also prevent kidney stones because the cause of kidney stones is a super saturated
urine that then you start forming this crystal out of calcium oxalate stones but if you have enough
fluid they won't get that concentrated so two to three liters of water is 8 to 12 cups of water
so i recommend putting in electrolytes and sea salt don't forget the sea salt a lot of times
people forget that and they wonder why they're tired you need both a good amount of potassium
and magnesium and sea salt to prevent keto fatigue keto flu and overall weakness now a
lot of people are doing my electrolytes it has a thousand milligrams of potassium and if they do
my electrolytes without adding sea salt they might end up with a salt deficiency and feel
weaker so one thing i do in the morning is i'll take about a liter of water
i'll take all my supplements i'll add a scoop of this and i will also add some more sea salt
probably 1/8 of a teaspoon i will dissolve it in there now the reason why i formulated this
with high amounts of potassium magnesium and just a little bit of calcium with a very low amount of
salt is because the average person starting keto is very heavy on sodium very low in potassium so
it helps to rebalance them but as you start doing keto when you start eating healthy you just don't
want to forget about the sea salt and i do have a sport electrolyte for more salt but the point is
when you do fasting and keto you need to keep your potassium and magnesium high as well as your sea
salts and sea salts are really an electrolyte too but i want to make a point about that because most
people do not add enough sea salt you need between one to one and a half teaspoons every single day
if you work out you need a lot more so it really depends on yours how much you sweat
i also add a greens powder the wheatgrass juice powder one scoop in that drink simply because
when you're doing fasting you are going to become more acidic
you're going to be in more deeper ketosis and the green powder tends to be more alkaline and
offset that acidity and this is especially important if someone's prone to have
gout because your uric acid levels will go up acting as an antioxidant when you do
fasting hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment

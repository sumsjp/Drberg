let's talk about the benefits of getting a nap
through the day as we get older we lose our ability to
sleep on average a person is sleeping two hours
less when they're older versus when they're younger
and that's incredible ideally you'd want to get 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep
and the question is can you make it up with naps the answer is
yes now there's many additional things that can affect our
our quality of sleep one would be age the next thing would be the amount of
stress but the one that i want to talk about
is quite interesting because so many people are experiencing this
right now but they're not aware of it and it has to do with the
number of hours you sit behind your computer
what happens when you're sitting behind the computer you're exposed to
emf okay electromagnetic fields just like i'm standing next to the smart
board right here and you can see the magnetic fields
going let's see if you can hear this way up here right
so if you're standing in front of your a computer like this
or other things like for example the power cables
the printer the battery backup they all have high levels of both
electrical field type energy and also electromagnetic
energy as well and then you have the wi-fi you have the
wireless mouse and wireless keyboard and
sometimes your computer is right underneath your desk
i will do a video demonstration just on this one topic
because i want to show you how much emf is coming off your computer right now
but the point is that energy affects your energy and it can drain you
and make you very very tired it can affect the electrical system of the
heart it can affect your brain especially if
you're using something called a cell phone and you're
holding it to your skull but i will do a video on that
specifically but the only thing i want to let you know right now
is that one of the reasons why you might be
tired is because of that right there and for those people that want to get
more information right off the bat i'm going to recommend
this device because it's and i'll put the link down below it's just really
easy to test and you could quickly find out what is producing the
most negative energy and rearrange your setup
to the point where you can have lower amounts of emf being
exposed from your computer especially if you're like me and sit behind a
computer for you know 14 hours a day let's talk about
the benefits of getting a nap number one you have a lot more energy
during the day you're going to be more alert
more focused you'll be able to learn better your you'll be less grouchy
your mood will be much better you'll find that if you have anxiety
that will be less make sure you also take b1
from nutritional yeast if you have anxiety okay because that's
very dramatic it'll drop your anxiety really quick
your memory will be better you'll have more creativity
you'll have less of an appetite because a lack of sleep affects your blood
sugars you'll have much better exercise
performance and endurance if you're getting enough sleep either at
night or adding a nap or two there's also a study that shows that
you'll have less accidents okay and you're going to be more
productive you're going to get more stuff
done and lastly i just have a question for you
type down below in the comments how many hours of sleep
you get on average each night now some of you like the sound of the
tapping on the board so i'm just gonna actually
it's apparently soothing for some people so i'm just gonna do it for about
30 minutes so you can take a nap
tell me when to stop

so check this out vitamin e has the ability to inhibit fibrosis now let me just kind of make
this more real to you you can have fibrosis in the lung as scar tissue from all sorts of problems
along whether it's advanced scar tissue in the lung which is COPD or maybe you had a series
of lung infections which created scar tissue you could also have like rheumatoid arthritis
that can develop scar tissue in the joints the actual heart tissue called the myocardium can
develop scar tissue and inhibit function the arteries can fill up with scar tissue making
the arteries very very stiff raising blood pressure setting you up for arterial sclerosis
also if those arteries go in the brain it can predispose you to even getting a stroke then you
have the amyloid plaque in the brain which is a protein which is a type of scar which is involved
with alzheimer's and then of course the liver once the liver becomes fatty and then inflamed that can
turn into scar tissue or fibrosis so fibrosis or scar tissue is pathological wound healing
there's connective tissue that's replacing functional tissue so now the function of that
tissue doesn't work normally because it's being replaced by scar tissue tocotrienols is what i
would recommend which is a certain type of vitamin e it's actually better than the tocopherols it's
like 50 to 90 times stronger and the reason for that is that tocotrienols inhibit the collateral
damage from white blood cells trying to heal the area now in past videos i talked about the
immune system having a function of defending against pathogens microbes viruses right
i've also talked about the function of the immune system killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors
but the immune system has a third function and it's involved very intimately in wound healing
anytime you have inflammation and wound healing you have the immune system you have the white
blood cells and it's the collateral damage the free radicals the oxidation that's being produced
by your own immune system that's creating the excessive damage in scar tissue so when the
white blood cells are releasing massive amounts of cytokines which are inflammatory and it's creating
all sorts of collateral damage then you get scar tissue so toe katrina's can neutralize those free
radicals it can counter that effect it can inhibit fibrosis so if you have an inflammatory condition
i would highly recommend take this before it turns into the scar tissue or fibrosis because the
problem is once it becomes to a certain level it's very difficult if not impossible to reverse it
now the dosage i would recommend per day would be at least 300 milligrams if you have a lot
inflammation you can take more or maybe you could take this three times a day i don't recommend
taking the tocotrienols with the tocopherols okay because sometimes the tocopherols can slow down
the effectiveness of the tocotrienols all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by
to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

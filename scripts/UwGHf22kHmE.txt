let's talk about niacin vitamin b3 and schizophrenia now there's some fascinating
information on this topic schizophrenia is a combination of having hallucinations
delusions paranoia mixed with feeling disconnected loss of interest in life and feeling emotionless
which basically is your apathetic now the medical theory of what causes schizophrenia is you have
dopamine excess and so you're given certain drugs to help regulate that the problem with
those drugs is it has certain side effects that cause metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance
which has been shown to worsen these symptoms because of what it does to the brain so as a side
note there's some great data i'll put some links down below of how ketones going on the ketogenic
diet can help reduce those symptoms but that's not part of this video it's a side note however there
was a doctor named dr abraham hoffer some years ago who had a different theory and that theory
was called the adrenal chrome theory adrenal chrome is basically the byproducts of adrenaline
and in his research he found that the chemical structure of adrenaline was very similar to lsd
and so it had certain types of effects on the brain if it was in higher amounts so his whole
theory was that schizophrenia comes from excessive amounts of adrenal chrome in the brain which is
toxic now normally you're supposed to have an enzyme that clears that chemical out and people
with schizophrenia have a defect with this enzyme so he found that by taking large doses of b3
not talking about the time release niacin the one that doesn't give you the flush
there's more side effects with that one rather than just take straight
b3 niacin but anyway he found that by taking large doses of niacin you can prevent the conversion
of the precursor for adrenaline called nor adrenaline thereby making less adrenaline so
it will help clear out adrenaline it helps you produce less adrenaline which can be toxic to
the brain especially if you have a defect to this enzyme but also b3 will reduce liver toxicity it
will help reduce oxidative stress and mitochondria as well as help your dna repair there are several
double-blinded studies that were done one of the studies showed a 79.5 improvement in symptoms now
he died some years ago but recently there were some other additional studies that were done
to show improvements with schizophrenia using high doses of not just b3 but other b vitamins as well
i'll put that research down below before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

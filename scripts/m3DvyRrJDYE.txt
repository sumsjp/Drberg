it's me again I want to talk about magnesium did you realize that 57% of
population is deficient in magnesium it's mainly because they don't eat
enough leafy greens but magnesium is found a deficiency of magnesium is found
in 80% of heart attacks so it's really important in the cardiovascular function
because where calcium controls the contraction of the heart magnesium
controls the relaxation of the heart okay and so magnesium clears out that
calcium so then you can relax so you always need them in proper ratios so if
you're deficient in magnesium you tend to get arrhythmias and that could be
anything from a skip beat to an extra beat to an abnormal beat to a flutter to
fibrillation atrial fibrillation to a palpitation where it's a little
hesitation all that electrical rhythm sort of speak the pacemaker problem
would be magnesium and then we have hyperirritability I mean what about
like hyperactive kids oh my gosh right here or hyperactive adults that just
can't wind down cramps muscle cramps cramps of the heart angina pain right
here spasm of the arteries that's coronary constriction this is great for
it help you sleep at night because it's a calming mineral soft
tissue calcium so what happens magnesium helps lower the calcium buildup in the
body so yes vitamin D and vitamin k2 will also help it but magnesium is
another key mineral to help balance the excess calcium in your body so if you're
deficient magnesium you could have a tendency to have more Spurs you can have
arthritis bursitis tendinitis calcium on the eye is cataract kidney stones gall
stones tartar on the teeth calcium buildup on the nerve a little twitching
called tetany that's magnesium deficiency and then we have high blood
pressure because magnesium is supposed to relax and calm things down people
take it for constipation as well to help relax the muscles in your colon and if
you're deficient you may be it might have memory problems or learning
disabilities or you're just learn as fast as you would like okay so
that's that's the effects of magnesium secondly what causes it
okay what causes a magnesium deficiency mainly the diet because people don't
consume enough leafy greens it's also in nuts it's in seeds it's in a lot of
other foods it's in eggs but mainly it's in leafy
greens I get my magnesium not from a pill but from a food based concentrate I
use the wheatgrass juice powder because if you look at chlorophyll chlorophyll
is like the blood of the plant magnesium is the center element like our body you
use blood with iron that's red but magnesium is green and that's what the
plant uses as its chlorophyll and so I consume concentrated so wheatgrass juice
powder 1tsp gives me all the magnesium I need and it's a real calming mineral so
it's even good to take before bed so diet is an important thing stress
depletes magnesium magnesium helps reduce cortisol magnesium reduces
adrenaline yeah amazing vitamin D deficiencies so you need
vitamin D not just to absorb calcium but to absorb magnesium yeah
alcohol will deplete magnesium diuretics will deplete magnesium anti acids you
need a strong stomach to absorb magnesium and all minerals by the way so
if you have acid reflux that means you have not enough stomach and you take
antacids anti anti anti acids you're going to not be able to absorb those
minerals so acid reflux really is not enough acid and so the valve doesn't
close and the acid shoots up and you get heartburn so that means you need to
acidify the stomach so you can fix that valve and then absorb the minerals so
really one of the clues for stomach acid is does the person have acid reflux yes
okay then no wonder they're not absorbing the minerals magnesium
especial so taking like tums and things like that
or antacids okay so I hope you learned a little bit about magnesium and
definitely apply this information and write your comments below

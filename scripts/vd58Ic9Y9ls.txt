now this is a one of those myths that i'm not sure where it came from but i hear it periodically
the reason why you're not losing weight is you're just not eating enough food
so eat more food and then you'll lose weight this absolutely does not make any sense at
all because how could adding more calories caused you to lose more calories it's illogical no that's
not the thing that stimulates your metabolism so this is just based on someone's opinion it's
wrong information and so you're going to have bad results if you just eat more calories and think
that's the thing that's going to help you what you do want to do is increase more nutrients okay
that's going to help you get healthy that makes more sense but the the right information is this
you want to reduce the carbs okay reduce your carbohydrate calories and then eat less frequently
i didn't say lower your calories just don't eat as often okay what's that going to do it's going
to decrease insulin what is that going to do it's going to fix something called insulin resistance
insulin resistance is what's behind a slow metabolism if you try to lose weight and you
can't seem to get down past a certain point you have like a set point of let's say it's
i don't know 160 pounds but you cannot get past that all that means is you have insulin resistance
and you've probably been eating carbs or dieting for a long time and so now your body is like
completely stuck okay how do you fix it very simply you get unhealthy keto you
reduce your carbs you increase your nutrients in your food and you decrease the frequency of
eating yes it is true if you lower your calories okay this could slow your metabolism especially
since most people that are lowering their calories are going on a low fat diet which is also usually
a high carbohydrate diet and also a low nutrient diet okay so if you lower your fat you're going to
be hungry all the time if you lower your nutrients you are going to starve your metabolism and if you
increase your carbs you're going to create insulin resistance and so that's one way to slow your
metabolism so the reason why you're not losing weight is not because you're not eating enough hey

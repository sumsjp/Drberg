so i wanted to create this short video to talk about
at what blood sugar level does a person start to notice
organ damage okay because it's important especially
if you are a diabetic or you're pre-diabetic or you have insulin
resistance and by the way i would say that at least 70 of the
population has insulin resistance and they're
headed to diabetes so this is a very important uh topic now
the ada american diabetes association the experts in diabetes say that
your a1c which is an average blood sugars of three months
should be below 7.4 okay now if we convert this to
blood sugars that's a blood sugar of 166 okay that is way way too high because
the damage starts to occur when it gets over a
hundred now one study which i'll put a link down
below indicated that uh fasting blood glucose levels at
between 110 and 125 already created a loss of 40 percent
of the beta cells of the pancreas the beta cells
are the cells in the pancreas that produce
insulin the more the beta cell becomes destroyed
the less insulin you have the higher the blood sugar
the more you have glucose toxicity and the more damage you're going to
experience now the ideal scene for an a1c would be less than
five okay it's five percent not 7.4 it's way too high it's definitely common
knowledge that you need to avoid added sugars but realize that
fruit has a lot of sugar starches have a lot of sugar and so do whole
grains so this could be part of the problem
right there diabetics in general already lost over
50 percent of their beta cells and that's why
they're diabetic because diabetes is defined as high blood
glucose okay why because insulin is not there to push it down and just
before that we have insulin resistance so that's creating a much higher output
of insulin over a long period of time which insulin itself is toxic
to the tissues now we have a situation with high glucose toxicity
and high insulin toxicity not good but it's very easy to solve all you have
to do is cut out the refined carbs and the sugars
and do intermittent fasting and the good news about this is that
you can reverse the damage okay if you get it in time
so that's the good news but you have to get it in time
all right thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto absolutely not karen
and it's an immune system builder absolutely
you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe

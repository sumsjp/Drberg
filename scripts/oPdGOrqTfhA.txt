so what is this thing called nac n acetyl l cysteine what is that that doesn't
explain anything well that's a stable form of cysteine which still doesn't explain anything
cystine is a non-essential amino acid basically it's a stabilizer for the formation of protein
structures in your body which still doesn't give you a lot of information so i'm just going to go
into the benefits of what this is and how it can help you first of all it's something that can
increase one of the most powerful antioxidants in your body called glutathione which means it
can help counter things like alcohol toxicity the toxic effects from certain medications that treat
adhd it can help reduce acne especially the scars from acne it can definitely help reduce addictions
like all addictions cocaine alcohol nicotine food addictions because nac helps normalize
neurotransmitters like glutamine and dopamine which are both involved in
addictions it can help copd which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because with
this condition there's a lot of oxidation going on and inflammation nac helps reduce
mucus so it's good in pneumonia lung issues asthma bronchitis number seven it can help reduce ocd
symptoms obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms number eight it can help reduce depression
because it affects the neurotransmitters as well as anxiety number nine relieves autism why

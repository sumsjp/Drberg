so i'm curious out of all the foods out
there
what do you think is the number one food
to help you boost testosterone but not
just testosterone increasing fertility
sperm count sperm motility what's your
guess
oysters okay oysters
are the food that contains the most zinc
out of any foods not just some regular
old zinc it has bioavailable zinc and
copper
and actually it is probably the most
nutrient-dense food behind
liver okay it's loaded with nutrition
just as a side note
if you are deficient in zinc
you could potentially develop something
called hypogonadism
your gonads actually shrink because you
don't have enough zinc
and testosterone is made by
the gonads now i know what someone's
going to comment
we shouldn't be consuming shellfish
especially oysters because of the micro
plastics in the ocean
one point on that if you consume pacific
oysters and you can even get them canned
you'll have the lowest amount of
microplastics but so is the lack of
nutrition in our diet and the lack of
nutrient-dense foods so we have to kind
of balance things out but oysters are
literally almost at the top of the list
to provide
nutrient-dense foods
and when you're trying to build up
testosterone it's not just about
increasing that one hormone it's about
supporting the entire endocrine system
all the hormones in the right balance so
this can help you at many different
levels oysters are loaded with zinc
copper in the right ratios
tons of b12
iron vitamin d b6 omega-3 fatty acids
and choline
now what you need to know is there's
other things too that can negate or
nullify your results when you consume
moistures like if you're in a statin
drug which blocks
cholesterol
which is needed to make testosterone in
fact that can nullify any foods that you
eat any supplements that you eat in
boosting your testosterone soy
soy decreases testosterone
grains this is the big one why because
it has phytic acid and phytic acid
blocks zinc
okay
low hydrochloric acid in your stomach
hydrochloric acid is necessary to absorb
the trace minerals especially zinc how
do you know if you have low hydrochloric
acid well
you're probably on an antacid because
heartburn
gerd
indigestion
acid reflux
all are indications of low hcl
sugar too much sugar will kill
testosterone too many refined
carbohydrates
stress will do it
lack of sleep is a really big one
and the more fat you have in your body
the more estrogen that you'll make
and the less testosterone that you will
make in fact your body will start
converting testosterone into estrogen
and
iron okay if you have too much iron that
can really damage the liver
and leave you with a very low
testosterone levels so even though
oysters are loaded with iron there is a
condition where you can have too much
iron
now on the flip side other things you
can do to increase testosterone i've
done a lot of videos on this
hardcore exercise with a lot of
sleep
recovery so it's the intensity and
volume of exercise with good recovery
that will help you boost testosterone
but you have to make sure you recover
from it the hormone pathways of
testosterone follow the hormone pathways
of growth hormone if one's higher the
other one's going to be a little bit
higher so they work together
cholesterol consuming enough cholesterol
foods consuming enough fatty foods this
is why eggs are good this is why
butter is good
because
testosterone is made out of cholesterol
low stress good sleep and red meat which
is also another food that's loaded with
iron
now what's really wild is that there's
this new
diet
that certain organizations want to put
the planet on but it's from a report
from the eat lancet commission
where they want to put the entire planet
on mostly grains and soy and beans and
legumes
and no red meat and very little eggs
that's a perfect recipe to make everyone
infertile with very low testosterone
and so if you haven't seen that video i
put it up right here check it out

did you realize that over 500 000 children under the age of 5 die of diarrhea every single year
that completely blows my mind now this actually is coming from a zinc deficiency so there's two main
reasons why people are deficient in zinc number one they don't have enough in their diet most of
the zinc in the diet comes from animal products meat organ meats as well as shellfish and seafood
so if you're not consuming those foods or you're a vegan you could be deficient in zinc now the other
reason why people and children are deficient in zinc is this they're consuming foods that are high
in something called phytates or phytic acid which is in the fiber part of grains so phytates block
the absorption of zinc and you're just creating a zinc deficiency now our bodies need zinc for many
many things but there are three main purposes of zinc in relationship to preventing diarrhea
number one zinc restores the mucosal barrier integrity of your intestines so if that gut
barrier is broken down you have what's called translocation of bacteria into your body
so when you don't have the barrier certain microbes can cross through this immune barrier
and create all sorts of immune reactions which then your body is going to defend that
with diarrhea number two zinc is intimately involved in the enzyme reactions within your
small intestine the lining of your small intestine actually makes enzymes and you need zinc to make
those enzymes to help you digest so if you're weak on the enzyme activity things don't get
digested thus the diarrhea and number three zinc is really needed for your antibodies to fight off
pathogens so that's not there your defenses for these pathogens go down and then you have this
immune reaction so the bottom line is if you're deficient in zinc your risk for diarrhea goes up
and you have a lot of digestive issues so if you have chronic diarrhea whether you're a child or an
adult you need to be taking zinc now there's some other things that you can take as well
bentonite clay is another good remedy for diarrhea and in some other videos i recommend kefir
unsweetened of course whole fat and blackberries blended together sometimes that can help as well
but if you're lactose intolerant that's not a good option you may be able to find some lactose free
kefir but your problem could also be an allergy to the casein in the dairy so you'd probably want
to avoid that however zinc is probably one of the most important things to take if you have diarrhea
now the other problem with diarrhea is that when you have diarrhea you lose your electrolytes
and your trace minerals so it's not just about taking zinc back into the body it's about taking
all the trace minerals and the electrolytes as well all right thank you for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

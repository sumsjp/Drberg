so I want to talk about the hormone effects that can occur from doing a fast
some really interesting research I put the link down below
comparing fasting for two to seven days versus fasting from 8 to 20 days so this
would definitely be a longer fast compared to a shorter fast now this data
is not based on intermittent fasting but at least you can get a concept of what
could happen to the endocrine system when you start to fast
the first hormone that's involved is adrenaline okay this is a counter
regulatory hormone so in other words when you go to sleep at night and you're
not eating sometimes you're going to get a release of glycogen so your body's
going to use glycogen as fuel especially if you haven't adapted to fat-burning
what happens is the glucose is being released and the blood sugars going up
this way and then insulin comes in there and pushes it down
and so there's counter regulatory hormones adrenaline being one of them
that will kick in and release the sugar and raise the sugar back up to prevent a
crash and blood sugars that can happen especially if you are instant resistance
this is the main reason why people may feel that they're not sleeping that well
when they're doing fasting I realize that's a temporary situation it's gonna
get better after you have adapted a little bit better and you've lessened
the insulin resistance issue what you can do in the meantime is take a little
calcium don't take calcium carbonate take
calcium citrate or calcium lactate right before bed and take some b1 okay
I like nutritionally use for that and this should help chill this out a little
bit so you can sleep through the night but you can see in a shorter turn fast
it'll go up more than a longer fast okay next one hormone is cortisol cortisol is a
stress hormone but it's also a counter regulatory hormone to prevent the blood
sugar from dropping too far same is what I just talked about right here
so cortisol released because cortisol is a glucocorticoid it releases sugar in
the system to try to keep the sugar up goes up when you do a fast between two
to seven days but with time after your liver adapts to ketosis you're not going
to have this spike in cortisol okay leptin here's the thing with leptin
it's a hormone that satisfies you when leptin goes up you're satisfied you
no longer have an appetite now the problem is that overweight people people
that are obese have high levels of leptin but it's not working in their
body because they have leptin resistance and then leptin doesn't work anymore so
you hear you have this overweight person that is starving all the time because
they may have high levels of leptin but it's unavailable to them when you start
doing a fast you start to reverse this process and you make the receptors for
leptin work better so leptin will come down to a normal range but the point is
that what caused the leptin resistance in the first place is a high level of
leptin so all we're doing with fasting is reversing that whole thing you're
reversing two things you're reversing leptin resistance as well as insulin and
resistance right here and this is the next one one I want to mention when you
do fasting the biggest benefit from that is the reduction in normalization of
insulin so insulin will come down and insulin is tied into so many problems
not just weight but inflammation cognitive function your mood your kidney
function your vision your heart so you're going to get massive benefits
from fasting just by normalizing this one hormone then we get the sertoli
serotonin will increase both in a two to six day fast as well as a eight to
twenty day fast and serotonin is going to give you a lot of cognitive benefits
you're gonna sleep a little better at night and the main thing that serotonin
will give you is just a a good state of well-being the next one is very
and that's growth hormone growth hormone really goes up especially from a two to
seven day fast growth hormone is the anti-aging hormone most people over the
age of 50 are deficient in growth hormone it also is protective against
muscles collagen joint problems it protects against a loose skin and
wrinkly old skin very very important and it also influences your cognitive
function too next one is glucagon nom what is that this hormone is the
opposing hormone to insulin it's made in the pancreas but it does the opposite of
insulin so it helps you burn fat it helps protect your proteins the way that
you increase this is you decrease this right here so it kind of works kind of
like on a teeter totter but fasting is a very powerful trigger
of glucagon exercise will trigger it as well exercise will also trigger growth
hormone especially if you do high intense interval training next one is t3
now I did a video specifically just on this recently and I'll put the link down
below but sometimes t3 will decrease okay now you might think oh my gosh
that's gonna be a problem with my metabolism but it's not because what
you're gonna have is you're gonna have an increase in reverse t3 which is kind
of like a t3 storage because your body is adapting to this new fuel and it's
becoming more efficient what's very unlikely you're gonna have any other bad
symptoms from this except you may have a slightly low t3 it might still be within
a normal range just on the low side I wouldn't worry about that because as
soon as you eat this will come up and then we have estrogen estrogen may
decrease when you do fasting well that's not a problem if your estrogen dominant
but what if you're already low in estrogen one of the best things to take
would be to take some vitamin E natural vitamin E in the whole complex to help
balance your sex hormones and this is one of them right here and when you do
fasting it's very important to take supplements while you fast just because
you don't know if you're deficient in a mineral
like potassium or some vitamin and because you're not eating you're not
getting the nutrients if you're deficient that can create even more
stress on the endocrine system but if you do fasting with nutrients it'll
protect the endocrine system and you have minimal issues with hormones but if
you take a look at some key things that have happened when you fast you get
massive improvement by decreasing insulin increasing serotonin increasing
growth hormone and glucagon and some of these other hormones will come back to
normal once you're fully adapted but I'm just bringing up the different changes
that can occur when you do a fast thanks for watching with another amazing recipe
no grains no sugar totally keto there's no suffering keto
absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to
check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself
it's just so easy to be keto but is it simple it's super simple we
hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

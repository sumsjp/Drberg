so in this video we want to talk about what makes sugar
actually addictive so we know certain drugs are addictive but why is sugar
actually addictive there's actually two mechanisms when you
consume comfort foods high in carbs desserts
breads candy sugar etc you increase insulin which then decreases
blood sugars then what happens certain sensory things from your blood
to your brain are triggered causing sugar cravings
okay so that's one mechanism number two is dopamine
when you even anticipate eating certain foods
it could be carbs junk foods things like that and then you actually eat them
you actually get a release of dopamine and the more concentrated sugar it is
the more massive the release dopamine
is connected to pleasure now they don't actually know exactly what dopamine does
there's a a lot of theories out there but they know
that dopamine increases when you have anticipation of a reward
when you attain a goal there's a spike of dopamine
they know it's involved in some way in motivation
motor control alertness even appetite so when you consume sugar you release
dopamine it goes into the cell it makes you feel good but over time
when you continue to do it chronically the receptors for dopamine
downgrade they become more resistant okay
until the point where dopamine doesn't quite get in there so there's a need for
more and more carbohydrates to achieve that same pleasure and that's
really the trap that's really an addiction it gets out of control
and then one day you're eating a mass amount of carbohydrates but you don't
get that pleasure that you used to get in the past
but the reason you're probably consuming it is just to handle the blood sugars
temporarily and all the while it's creating a massive amount of damage in
different parts of your body specifically the eyes the kidney the
heart and the brain including certain nerves
so if you are addicted to sugar you just need a substitute for things
that are similar to sugar if you want more information on that i

so today we're going to talk about diabetes 1.5
what is that diabetes 1.5 interesting it's not 1 it's not 2.
it's right in the middle so diabetes 1.5 is a combination of
it's part type 1 diabetes and it's part type 2.
so diabetes type one is destruction of the beta cells
the beta cells are the cells in the pancreas
that make insulin okay and this is an autoimmune disease
and what's happening is you have antibodies that are attacking
the cells that make insulin decreasing the production of insulin so you just
don't make insulin anymore so you have to take insulin that's type
1. type 2 is the problem on the other end
it's the problem in the receptor okay so you have insulin resistance so
it's really a situation because not only do you not make
insulin you can't receive it so it's a double diabetes and that's
another name for it now the problem is that this condition
is happening more and more in children as
well and so i think based on evidence out there
that is purely a situation it's not diet it's from vaccinations nowadays
a child gets about 80 vaccinations okay so it creates a lot of inflammation
okay so we have a lot of inflammation going on
from repeated stimulation of the immune system
then what happens is you have cortisol that comes in
adrenal makes it which is an anti-inflammatory so it's going to try
to put out the if there's not enough cortisol
then there's still going to be enough inflammation to create damage
in the cells of the pancreas so a lot of children
are now getting double diabetes you didn't see this
back in the early 90s or 80s it was after the repeated introduction
of all these vaccinations now i want to talk a little bit about
some of the symptoms of diabetes 1.5 okay number one
be frequent urination okay so you're peeing all the time
especially at night number two you're thirsty all the time
number three you're getting weight loss okay why because you have
type one as well as type two together okay so
in diabetes type one people are not necessarily obese
because insulin is a fat storing hormone they have a problem with that so they
have a hard time storing fat so the body will start going after
muscle protein and it's a mess so sometimes you get weight loss and a
lot of times in this diabetes 1.5 or double diabetes you
don't necessarily always see obese people
see if it was just a type 2 you could just
get the person on the right eating plan and correct it
but type 1 is different another symptom would be blurred
vision okay and then you have nerve damage like at the bottom of your
feet tingling numbness it's called
paresthesia and then we have vision problems
okay so those are the symptoms and in order for you to know if you have type 1
or type 2 you have to get a test you have to get
an auto antibody test it'll measure those antibodies that are
attacking your own tissues now when i was in practice i would see
people that started out type 2 diabetes and then
somehow they started needing insulin and i'm like why would they need insulin
it's getting worse and worse and so what i was looking at back then was
diabetes 1.5 because a lot of people were tested and they were
found to have antibodies against their own pancreas well basically looking back
i can see now it was definitely a double-edged sword they had not only the
damage to the receptors but also now to the beta cells so
we have the situation where maybe it started off type
2 and then it graduated into type 1 but they also at the same time had a bit
of the insulin resistance so not only did
they not make insulin it just didn't work
in their body so let me just give you some
tips on what i would recommend to help deal with this situation
number one i would make sure that i would eat foods high in nutrients
specifically phytonutrients why because phytonutrients plant-based chemicals
decrease the complication from diabetes so at least
you wouldn't get the severity of the symptoms
okay that would be number one number two i would really beef up
on my vitamin d vitamin d is one of the best
things for autoimmune conditions especially
for inflammation and i would probably do 20 to maybe 30
000 iu's of vitamin d every single day zinc
is very important for the cells and the pancreas the beta cells there
it's also very important in the immune system
especially autoimmune conditions another condition would be
vitamin b1 but i would get this in a fat soluble form called benfotamine
okay this is a really good vitamin to help
protect against the complications of this issue and then
another thing that i would get it's called
nicotinamide okay so i would do vitamin d
zinc b1 and nicotinamide so you want to do vitamin d 20 000 to 30
000 ius okay per day zinc
i would do at least 50 milligrams per day i would do vitamin b1
in the form of benfotamine and i would do probably about four
tablets a day or capsules then nicotinamide and for that one i
would follow what it recommends on the
description on the bottle and in the comments section i'm gonna
put a very important paper that i highly recommend that you download
it's from molecular and genetic medicine review of vaccine-induced immune
overload and the resulting epidemics of type 1
diabetes and metabolic syndrome emphasis on explaining the recent
accelerations and the risk of pre-diabetes and other
immune mediated diseases is fascinating
and you need to know about it thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto absolutely not karen
and it's an immune system builder absolutely
you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe
and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy
making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

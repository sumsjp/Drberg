today i'm going to talk about some
interesting ways that manufacturing
companies can trick people
when you're reading nutritional facts or
on the label now i'm not going to talk
about the front of the packaging where
they'll use things like farm fresh
or free range or natural
i'm primarily going to talk about what's
on the back of the label there's a lot
of things on this label but we're going
to do a deep dive into real specific
important points that you need to know
about the first thing is the serving
size
realize that
when you're looking at
the different values especially total
carbohydrates
net carbs sugars
realize that those figures are per
serving size not the whole container so
you really have to look at what is in a
serving size okay what is in the whole
container how many serving sizes are you
going to consume
in that meal and then multiply that
times the total net carb because if you
don't you can very easily be misled
because some of these products have like
33 serving size and you might eat the
whole
box of something
and think you're okay when you're not
really okay all right the next point is
regarding trans fats that's under total
fats at the top and here's the standard
if you have trans fats of less than
a half of a gram
which is less than 500 milligrams
you can make your trans fats as zero so
remember the serving size if your
serving size
is
30 for example
and there is like 499 milligrams of
trans fats per serving size and you eat
the whole
box guess what you're getting a lot of
trans fats without knowing it
so how do you know you have trans fats
well you go to the bottom part where it
says ingredients and you look for two
words one is hydrogenated and the other
is partially hydrogenated if it has
either one of those two words then you
know there's trans fats in this product
all right the next part i want to talk
about is the most important part of this
video and it's really
understanding carbohydrates and what
that means okay so you have the total
carbohydrates and then underneath that
you have dietary fiber and underneath
that you have total sugars and then
you're also supposed to see the added
sugars
and then under that you may see sugar
alcohols so sugar alcohols are
sweeteners that don't apparently
increase
insulin too much so they are not
classified under sugars
they're instead classified as sugar
alcohols now let me just switch over to
net carbs what is a net carb a net carb
is you take the total carb and you minus
the fiber that will give you this net
carb and that's basically what you're
going to be using
to be in keto in other words to be in
keto
then that carb needs to be below
50 grams per
day
now this might sound pretty easy to
understand and
and follow and implement but there's a
couple tricks that manufactured
companies use um to make these values
look
more favorable let's talk about the
first trick okay multi-dextrin
multidextrin is mostly a polysaccharide
where's the polysaccharide that's a
starch okay and so starch is a
series of sugars that are attached
together
and so starch is not classified under
sugars it's under total carbohydrate and
the way this is classified is this if
you have a polysaccharide okay a starch
you don't have to put it under sugars if
it's a disaccharide which is two
connecting sugars or a monosaccharide
which is one sugar like glucose
it needs to be classified under
sugars but because maltodextrin is
classified as a polysaccharide it
doesn't have to be listed under sugars
despite acting like a sugar okay because
if you look at the glycemic index
maltodextrin is like
way way higher than sugar it's higher
than glucose maltodextrin is between 106
and 130
it's way the heck up there
now that's because it gets absorbed in
the stomach a lot faster than sugar and
that's probably because it's far from
being natural the way that they make
malt deduction is using all sorts of
chemical processes that break down corn
starch now it could also be tapioca it
can also be wheat it could also be
potato
rice but it's usually corn starch and
then they heat it under high pressures
using certain chemicals and they come
out with this maltodextrin and
maltodextrin is in so many products
and if maltodextrin does have some
disaccharide or monosaccharide that is
supposed to be in the sugars however you
can go to amazon right now and buy
maltodextrin and look at the back of the
label you'll see that it has no sugar
it's all carbohydrate that means it's
all starch
and the problem with that is that a lot
of times they'll advertise this product
with less than one gram of sugar or or
no sugar but it has a lot of
carbohydrate that acts like sugar even
worse than sugar and the other
interesting thing is maltodextrin many
times is not used to sweeten something
it's used as a flow agent to help dry
out certain extracts even like stevia
for example and if that per serving size
is less than a half a gram of
maltodextrin that can be considered as
zero so in other words you could be
getting maltodextrin without even
knowing you're getting it if it's less
than 500
milligrams per serving size now
everything that i talked about
maltodextrin that also applies to
dextrin because dextrin is also a
polysaccharide a starch that can act
like sugar but it's not classified as a
sugar it's a starch under the total
carbs so you just want to avoid any
products with maltodextrin or dextrin
now
to make things even more complex
you also have something called resistant
maltodextrin okay now this is classified
as a fiber in other words
manufacturing companies have found a way
to turn
this polysaccharide this starch
maltodextrin
into a fiber chemically so it's an
isolated chemically made they call it a
functional fiber
and now they're positioning functional
fibers as a
health benefiting
ingredient and so you have soluble corn
fiber which basically is resistant mold
adduction
tapioca fiber which is resistant
multi-doctrine these are all fibers and
not classified under sugars
and they are deducted from the total
carbohydrate
so you can have a lot of these new
fibers in your gradient
that basically are not even calculated
in this equation because they're
deducted out with the fiber now the
question is do they affect your blood
sugars well there's studies that say
that they might but the problem is these
new functional fibers
are new to our diet and a lot of people
are having a lot of digestive problems
inflammation bloating gas diarrhea
and so the jury is still out and
personally i would stick with fiber that
comes from real food like vegetables
there is a big difference between an
isolated
synthesized
fiber
and fiber that comes from nature with
all the other factors that work
synergistically and just think about the
source of these fibers like wheat for
example or corn or potato or rice or
tapioca and i'm not going to even get
into whether they're gmo or not at this
this point all right so that's the fiber
part
let's touch on the sugar alcohols for a
second remember i told you that sugar
alcohols can also be deducted just like
fiber from total carbs to get your net
carbs well there are certain sugar
alcohols that definitely will spike your
blood sugars and create a problem and
the big one is maltol but you also have
sorbitol
and mannitol
now xylitol can affect the blood sugars
to some degree
but not as much as the other ones the
only sugar alcohol that i know that
doesn't affect your blood sugars is
erythritol
so even now these sugar alcohols are
deducted from the total carbohydrates
giving you the net carb your blood
sugars can still be affected and on top
of that let's say
some of this fiber or functional fiber
resistant starch that you consume
is creating a lot of digestive issues
well the stress in your digestive system
could potentially elevate your blood
sugars why because of all the
inflammation that's created
now one side note when when you
bake things that are keto friendly
using erythritol they usually add stevia
or
monk fruit okay
in addition they're also adding
maltodextrin to that
so if you're going to get a sweetener
make sure you get the ones that don't
have the maltodextrin or dextrin
multiduction many times is not even that
sweet but it's there as a filler it
gives you the mouth feel it gives you a
certain texture
very similar to fat but it sure acts
like a carbohydrate so we're looking at
this label and we're trying to get this
net carb it's very important to
understand the
type of carb
that's in this product okay because if
we're going to try to do the healthy
version of keto
we want healthy ingredients
and so that number
50 grams net carb
should be
quality nutrient dense carbohydrates
and all these resistant starches just
don't have the nutrient values um
compared to regular real food
now another way that manufacturing
companies trick people
is with this whole grains right i mean
just take a look in the grocery store
all these cereals and i'm talking about
the worst cereals that you can eat you
know filled with sugars the right at the
top it says whole grain and of course
people think that that gives some
benefit but what about all the other
things that are added to the whole grain
right i mean to make it taste good of
course you get sugars chemicals
preservatives not to mention the whole
grain is ground into flour and who knows
how long it's been oxidized or sitting
on some shelf before it's turned into
some product i mean these delicate
vitamins these fat soluble vitamins in
grains are highly susceptible to oxygen
and heat and they can go rancid really
fast and then when they're put into a
product and they sit on a shelf for a
period of time you're consuming a
product that has very very low levels of
nutrients so just because something says
100 whole grains
doesn't mean they're 100
healthy now the other point i want to
bring up is that when you look at some
of these keto friendly products they
actually put in there like wheat gluten
right well yeah that's a protein but so
many people have a gluten intolerance
and they're going to have a lot of
digestive issues from that type of
protein and then you have soy protein
isolates
probably one of the lowest quality
sources of protein that you can get is
soy protein isolates it's just not a
natural thing that we're supposed to eat
another point about sweeteners even keto
friendly foods have
sugar in them but they will have low
amounts of sugar
and many times that sugar is not even
cane sugar it's beet sugar and 95 of all
beet sugar is gmo so it has traces of
glyphosate which is the herbicide they
spray when you have gmo products now the
same thing with wheat wheat is not gmo
but they still sometimes spray it
with glyphosate and i want to touch on
non-gmo for a second it does not mean
genetically modified organism free
it's listed as non-gmo project verified
so basically they go through a series of
standards that they must meet they don't
necessarily test them to see if there's
actually gmo organisms or byproducts in
the product it's a checklist that they
follow which lowers the risk of having
gmo foods in that product so non-gmo
project verified does not mean
absolutely 100
free of gmos
and the last point i want to bring up is
this point about antibiotics
when a product says no antibiotics
it doesn't mean that there hasn't been
antibiotics used you just can't use
antibiotics past the second day of life
but as far as eggs go if an egg has not
been hatched yet or let's say it's been
hatched and that chick is alive for one
day and it's given antibiotics
but then from the second day on no
antibiotics it could be classified as
no antibiotics
even though it was given antibiotics on
the first day now if something is
classified as no growth promoting
antibiotics that doesn't mean they're
not using antibiotics they're just using
antibiotics for different purposes
not necessarily for growing the chicken
but for other reasons like the chicken
is sick and when they say no medically
important antibiotics
that means that they're not using
antibiotics that are used for humans but
they can use other types of antibiotics
that are not for humans but for animals
so i just wanted to talk about and list
several tricks that manufacture
companies use to get you to buy their
products
and i really highly suggest you start
reading labels right now and apply this
information now i think the best next
video for you to watch
would be the one on organic food check
it out i put it right here

hey guys have another question for you one boost more growth hormone intermittent fasting or
high-intensity interval training what do you think growth hormone is the main fat burning
hormone it's the main hormone that will help speed body mass it's a very anti-aging hormone
as well so what do you think it is in a minute fasting or high-intensity interval training I'll
just tell you in a minute fasting will boost growth on them by 2,000 percent that's pretty
good right high intensity interval training will boost it by 450 to 700 percent so the winner is
intermittent fasting now I'm going to send put some links down below yes these studies were
done on men that women so that's a little catch-22 and the high intensity interval training was done
with sprinting so it's not with all exercises but it works for sprinting it's going to work
for other things as well so you would think that this high intensity old training would
produce way more growth Roma but really it's the intermittent fasting so this right here is
so important in fixing selma issues weight loss decreasing insulin fixing insulin resistance if
you're a diabetic if you could do this this would be really good you want to consume two or three
meals a day without any snacking between you go to two meals that season better some people
can't do that at first you have to ease up to it you got to add a little more fat with the
meals but this is not a low calorie thing this is a high dense nutrient-dense meal but you're
just not eating constantly and grazing okay 2,000 percent growth hormone and the other thing is that
you're not going to lose muscle mass because when growth hormone increases it protects you against
muscle loss so that's really cool alright so thanks for watching hey guys thank you so

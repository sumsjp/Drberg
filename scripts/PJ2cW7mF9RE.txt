so i wanted to do a video on the hidden sources of gluten gluten is in so many foods
most people know that gluten is in most grain products like wheat spelt rye barley kamut
bulgur and couscous and as a side note when you consume wheatgrass juice powder you're not getting
any gluten because gluten forms in the grain which occurs when the wheat grows to a certain length
when they're processing wheatgrass juice powder you're only talking about these baby
grasses which are about six inches now typically gluten is not in oats corn or quinoa however
sometimes these grains are processed in the same manufacturing facility as you
know other grains so they could have traces of gluten and some people do react to the protein
in oats very similar to how they're reacting in gluten but it's a different protein but i want to
talk about the hidden sources of gluten that you may not be aware of it's in soy sauce it's in beer
it's in meat substitutes coffee creamers broth chewing gum flavored tea fish sticks
would you believe that saying gravy hot dogs of course if you're doing grass-fed hot dogs
chances are you're not going to have gluten in that it's also an imitation seafood toothpaste
candy and chips now sometimes when i talk to a client i have to expand where you're going to find
gluten so just because i say wheat spelt rye they might not connect it's in bread
pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes and even muffins so what is the big deal about
gluten why is it so bad well it just so happens to be linked to about 55 different diseases it
creates some massive destruction with a lot of people and they will tell you it's not very common
but it actually is very common usually those people telling you that it's not very common
are selling gluten as they're one of their products but it can create leaky gut it can create
what's called molecular mimicry in other words the molecules the shape of the protein gluten
is very similar to certain tissues in our own body like the thyroid gland so if you have antibiotics
to gluten those antibodies can now be attacking your own thyroid gland and the myelin sheath which
could potentially lead to hashimoto's which is an autoimmune condition as well as ms and there's
another condition which i will do a separate video on called gluten ataxia ataxia means
lack of coordination out of balance you have damage in a certain part of your brain causing
this problem with your motor control so you have gait problems coordination problems etc
and 40 percent of a type of gluten ataxia is called idiopathic comes from gluten
and i don't know how they came up with that because idiopathic means unknown cause so they're
telling you that the cause of idiopathic ataxia is gluten i mean why don't you just say gluten ataxia
so anyway gluten can mess up your brain there's a tremendous amount of gi problems with gluten pain
in your stomach bloating but there's also a lot of cognitive issues as well headaches brain fog adhd
anxiety depression bipolar schizophrenia and even vertigo so not only do i recommend gluten-free but
just get rid of all the grains just because it's gluten-free doesn't make it low-carb
and it's amazing i have to even tell people that and i would just assume that's common sense
but there's a lot of people that don't make that connection they think oh it's gluten free so it's
low carb not necessarily before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

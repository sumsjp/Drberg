so today we're going to talk about some of the nutritional
deficiencies that can be created when you drink too much alcohol especially beer now many people
drink alcohol but this video is mainly for those who drink a lot of beer okay there's a condition
called photomania it's an actual condition medical condition which involves drinking a lot of beer
and creating a severe electrolyte imbalance because i want to talk about this because
if you know of someone who drinks a lot of beer like teenager whatever this could create a major
problem that can be easily prevented now what happens when you drink a lot of beer
is you deplete your electrolytes you deplete sodium potassium magnesium and calcium there's
a condition called hyponatremia which is low sodium in your blood and here are the symptoms
dizziness weakness seizures headaches you can even go in a coma inability to think
confusion nausea of course some of these symptoms are related to a hangover right
well a lot of these hangovers occur because of the electrolyte deficient in the first place now if
we compound this let's say someone's drinking a lot of beer and they're outside in the sun
and they're sweating so they're going to be losing a lot of sodium and let's say they drink too much
and they vomit you're going to lose a tremendous amount of sodium and other electrolytes when you
vomit and then let's say they're consuming carbs which are going to also deplete your electrolytes
by doing that and there's a few other things that can actually make it worse as well let's say the
person's on diuretics or they're a diabetic both of those conditions end up with severe
electrolyte deficiencies so you can see i listed all the potential things that can throw off your
electrolytes on top of drinking too much beer and last point i want to bring up is if someone is a
chronic beer drinker or chronic alcoholic they're going to set up a lot of deficiencies in their
body which will lead to a lot of other symptoms which are then treated with medications which then
deplete more nutrients so the whole cycle goes round and round if you want to see more videos

so today we're gonna talk about the Black Plague and the somewhat recent
discovery about the true nature of this pandemic which is actually quite
interesting because it relates to nutrition so this pandemic roughly
occurred in the year 1348 and don't quote me it's right
around this period of time it could happen a little bit before or a little
bit after but there are between 70 to 200 million people who died in that
pandemic and the discovery that they made was in an unmarked grave in the
north part of London where they dug up these skeletons and they study these
skeletons and they found a good handful of these skeletons had rickets I don't
know if you know much about rickets but all you need to know is that is a
vitamin D deficiency they also found they had very bad teeth which is also a
vitamin D deficiency they found they were anemic based on the bone
composition they also found a lot of injuries as if
these people were in a war and right around that time there was a war in fact
there was a war for a hundred years so you have the combination of malnutrition
and a war that would create a perfect storm for a weakened immune system I
mean think about it if a child has rickets and there's a lot of kids that
have rickets the parents are also going to have a vitamin D deficiency because
rickets is a severe vitamin D deficiency you can imagine if you're that low in
vitamin D you're not going to have a good immune system at all because the
vitamin D deficiency will create a susceptibility to infection and also
will lower the number of white blood cells
that's your army that fights off the infection also it creates a weakness
within the strength of your white blood cells they're not able to create
generate the weaponry to defend themselves so you send in the battle
without the weapons and they all get killed you also will have less control
over inflammation especially in now this also relates to a pandemic that
occurred in 1918 called the Spanish flu in which over I think 50 to a hundred
million people died now what was interesting about this pandemic versus
this one there's some similarities this one also peaked in the dead of winter in
January which is the time of the year where you had the least amount of
vitamin D in the body also you had a war World War 1 and in that war you had a
huge shift in what people ate they had to preserve foods and they started
canning foods and boxing foods and anytime you do that you start dropping
the nutritional levels big-time so you really didn't have a lot of fresh
nutrient-dense foods especially the soldiers and because this was a world
war involving many different countries you had many more people dying and you
also had a lot of malnutrition all over the globe so my point about this
pandemic was this also was related to malnutrition I mean take a look at COVID-19
the people that are dying are older and people with a weakened immune system
that's what we should be focusing on just as much as we're in the mask
washing your hands so if you wanted more information about how to boost a healthy
immune system check this video out right here

what is lacking nutrient-wise when you have a split nail whether it's in your fingernail or
your toenail there's a medical condition called anacostia this is a fancy turn for
you have brittle nails or split nails soft nails fin nails or peeling of your nails
now it could be low iron in some cases could be low amounts of biotin
but the most likely cause is low calcium it's a calcium deficiency now
you could also be low in vitamin d that's preventing you from absorbing calcium
but this is the most common reason for split nails all right the best calcium source
would be something like calcium lactate calcium orotate calcium citrate but do not do the calcium
carbonate okay why because it takes like 12 different steps for your body to absorb that
and you could also do a high quality cheese as well like maybe organic grass-fed cheese
from europe that would be also a good way to get your calcium other symptoms of a
calcium deficiency would be fatigue weak grip strength muscle aches twitching weakened bones
they're brittle or you have cramping it could be in your feet it could be in your calf there's some
other symptoms as well like little tingling around your lips like it's called paresthesia but this
is probably the most likely reason why you have split nails and you can easily get some calcium
lactate or oratate or citrate and resolve this problem all right thanks for watching hey before

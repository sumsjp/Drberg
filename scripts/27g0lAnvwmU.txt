now there's many things that can cause inflammation i've done a lot of videos on this
but did you know that your own fat could be keeping you inflamed the fat cell or adipocyte
is not only a storage for triglycerides but it's an actual endocrine gland it makes
hormones like leptin which decreases your appetite and estrogen and there's several other hormones
it's involved in immunity it actually makes stem cells which is fascinating it's involved in
your appetite with this hormone right here it's involved with blood pressure insulin regulation
and this right here tnf alpha which is a cytokine what is that that is a signaling molecule that
triggers inflammation so it's pro inflammatory so your fat cells specifically the visceral fat
that's in your midsection triggers this right here which then keeps your body inflamed now
that inflammation then causes insulin resistance and then insulin resistance will make you more fat
and more fat causes this causes this so they feed on each other as a circular mechanism if you're
severely overweight and you're taking i don't know taking certain supplements to help you decrease
inflammation and it's not working it could be you need to reduce the amount of fat that's in your
midsection this is what you need to do you just need to keep your carbs below 20 grams per day
you need to do intermittent fasting i put a link down below if you're new to my channel
vitamin d taken in about 30000 IUs would be a very good thing to help you with inflammation as a kind
of a coping mechanism as you lose weight number four choline it's a supplement you can get it it
helps to take fat off the liver which is always part of it because if the liver fills up with fat
it spills over into the abdominal area so choline is very very essential as well as bile salts bile
salt helps reduce fat in your liver same thing with colon these two together are really good to
help reduce the fat in your mid section but this also is an anti-inflammatory by itself
and number six this thing called exercise if you did 45 minutes a day just long walks
that would help you greatly so in summary this is the recommendations that i would do
to help you lose weight and get rid of your inflammation before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

you know today we're going to talk about the necessity of germs now humans have co-evolved with
these microbes for a very long time these microbes have been on this planet for a lot longer than
humans and so we have a beneficial relationship with these microbes they give us certain things we
give them a home to live in so let's talk a little bit more about this topic there's something called
the hygiene theory which i think is not a theory it's actually a truth because when you expose
a child for example to a sterile environment they're at risk for getting allergies and even
autoimmune type conditions and so microbes play a really important part in building
our immunity this is why you should let your kids play in the dirt and kids that are grown up in a
sterile environment they just don't have the same health they're more at risk for getting asthma
allergies and a lot of other issues now a baby is born with the innate part of the immune system
which is received from the mother so the strength or weakness of that immune system that that mother
developed is given to the infant but then we also have another part of the immune system called
the acquired immune system which is pretty much a blank slate it's neutral when you're born you have
to develop it and it takes time so the acquired immune system is something that you acquire
by exposing yourself to germs microbes so our bodies develop antibodies and many other immune
cells to then create immunity and i think the medical profession a lot of people are ignoring
these vital importance of strengthening your immune system versus trying to boost your immune
system in other ways you have 100 trillion microbes growing inside your body as well as
on the surface of your body so in other words your skin is an important immune gland so for
example if you try to scrub your face to try to scrub off the dirt to make it really clean you end
up destroying the the flora or the microorganisms in your face and you end up then becoming immune
deficient and you start getting acne redness rashes things like that because you've just
taken away that friendly flora so as a side note let's just talk about how this relates to
farming so you have conventional farming practices where they use pesticides herbicides fungicides
they use fertilizer like npk nitrogen phosphorus and potassium which is a very common practice
but you know what there's a lot more minerals than just three so they put this npk in there
as a fertilizer to help give the plant some basic nutrients but what you have to realize is the root
system and the surrounding things around the root is not only the digestive system of that plant
but it's the immune system and so in natural farming they pay attention to the microbes
they fortify the microbes i'm talking about bacteria fungus and a lot of other microbes
so when dirt has microbes it's called soil when dirt doesn't have microbes it's called dirt and so
in conventional farming we have this one-way flow of communication we stick the nutrients in there
they suck into the plant and then the plant is harvested right well in natural farming we have
a two-way communication we have the plant through sunlight and co2 carbon dioxide being exposed to
the plant the plant goes through photosynthesis it makes carbohydrates 25% of those carbohydrates
are driven down to the plant into the roots where they're fed to the microbes the microbes are not
on the ketogenic plan microbes love sugar so in exchange for this carbohydrate the microbes
through their enzymes and acids start breaking down the minerals to help mobilize the minerals
from rocks and other things and it helps to bring the nutrients through this root system so then it
can be sucked up as a bi-directional flow so we have the minerals coming up through the help of
the microbes and we have the carbohydrates going down it's a perfect exchange so in natural farming
you have this plant that has way more nutrients less weeds because it has a stronger immune system
now in conventional farming we don't have an immune system so we have to kill the weeds with
chemicals and roundup ready things like that and natural farming we have a better immunity we have
better flavor of that food so the vegetables that you eat at the grocery store that are
basically flavorless really don't have near the nutrients or the phytonutrients that you would you
would have if you were to grow them in a garden but the whole point about this is that these
microbes are very important in creating a healthy immune system so healthy soils healthy plants
healthy food for humans healthy food for animals and if we eat healthy animals we become
healthy so our health is really dependent on these microbes so if you're enjoying my content

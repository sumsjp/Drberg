hey guys I'm going to talk about leptin there's a lot of confusion on what leptin is they think
they maybe could take into supplement it's going to help them this way let's just kind of give
you the basics of what it is leptin is a hormone okay that's a it's a particle in your body that's
produced by various tissues or glands in this case is produced by a fat cell that sends a signal to
the blood telling the body to do certain things so leptin is this satiety hormone it's the message of
leptin is stop eating unsatisfied okay so let me ask you a question are you hungry right now do you
get cravings do you feel like you're satisfied easily well it could be because your leptin is
too low so let's kind of cover what that means so your fat cells make leptin okay the more fat you
have the higher level of leptin you should have okay so if someone's really fat they should have
a lot of leptin and not be hungry but that's not the case so what happens with this hormone is that
they have so much left in being pushed out and pumped out from the fat cell which is abnormal
that the receptors that receive that leptin start resisting left in so it's very similar to insulin
resistance in that you have high levels of hormone communication that go into the receptor and the
Septor protects itself by downgrading so in a case with insulin resistance you have certain parts of
value that we have high insulin and other parts we have very low insulin same thing with left him
so very overweight people have a situation where they have a lot of leptin but it's unavailable
to their body and that means they're going to be hungry most the time so here they have this
huge fat fat supply storage system but they're always hungry they're like they're starving and
so when people say that oh yeah it's easy to lose weight just you know have willpower well
hormone only this is going to really force you to eat because your hormones are completely out
of whack it's not just as easy as saying I'm just not going to eat anymore so the point is
that the whole theory of low willpower causing weight gain is is not true especially when you
get into leptin it's part of the reward system of the body so people feel like I don't know if this
ever happened to you where you feel like you have to reward yourself as food right well that's part
of this whole leptin thing it's just it's like a it's like a it's part of the center of the brain
which actually has pleasure and it's also part of the brain that's stimulated by certain drugs that
give you pleasure and the whole thing but here's the thing here's what you have to do you have to
follow the the rules on insulin in that you want to keep your insulin low and I'm going to put a
link down below if you've never watched my videos on how to do that because that's the fastest way
to lose fat because the solution to this is to get rid of your fat to make it easier to
heal the leptin to the point where your leptin resistance can go away and you can have normal
leptin so your cravings will go away I think the best thing to eat to satisfy you in the meantime
would be actual fat at the meal so I'm going to put a link down below most of you watching have
already seen those videos but if you haven't you can click down below to how to heal the
system to actually get rid of cravings but you know Lipton is kind of a secondary hormone and
that's why I haven't really done any videos on it it's not something you can trigger with
taking a food and the supplements that people take it's a joke they don't really work because
by the time first of all I don't believe that there's actual leptin in a supplement that you
buy at the over the amazon.com and I also even if it was a hormone it be digested by the stomach
unless it was injected through the protein so that's not going to happen so the real
solution is to just understand what it does and then focus on reducing insulin get the fat off
this will heal the cravings will get better as well thanks for watching hey guys thank you so
much for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video

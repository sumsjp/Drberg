today we're going to talk about the hidden source of acne okay I've done
other videos on this topic and the other videos that you should watch them relate
to a high carb diet because high amounts of carbohydrates trigger insulin which
then is converted to androgens especially in polycystic ovarian
syndrome so when you go on a low-carb diet or a keto diet you actually get rid
of your acne but what happens for some people who are sensitive to Dairy they
may get acne despite consuming dairy products that
are low in carbohydrate okay and it has to do with a couple reasons one dairy or
milk contains many growth factors and hormones okay including androgens and
estrogens and other types of hormones that can stimulate growth of certain
types of things in the case of acne you're talking about growth of the
sebaceous gland the oil gland and when those glands get enlarged that becomes
acne now if we take a look at the different types of dairy we have milk
cheese cream butter and ghee I want to talk about the difference between these
one cup of milk actually has 8 grams protein 8 grams of fat but 13 grams of
carbohydrate that's very very high now that carbohydrate is milk sugar lactose
and lactose intolerance is very very common so right there you have this
reaction that people have when they consume dairy and that can manifest as
an inflammatory condition in the gut or the skin
now with dairy you can also have an allergy to the protein in dairy and that
would be casein a casein allergy very common so it's not just the milk sugar
it could be the protein as well now if we take a look at cheese 2 ounces of
cheese will give you 7 grams protein 9 grams of fat but only 0.4
grams of carbs so if you are lactose intolerant you'll probably be okay with
cheese for the most part but not if you have a protein allergy like to casein
now 1/2 a cup of cream ok 3 grams of protein 43 grams of fat and 3 grams of
carb now if you're consuming cream for example in your coffee or you make a
keto dessert there's lower amounts of carbs than milk but you could be
sensitive to it also if you have an allergy there's a little bit of protein
and cream but this is a half a cup normally in your coffee you're only
going to put a little bit so you might not notice any reaction at all with that
but if you're gonna do cream in your coffee I would definitely make sure it's
organic and if you can get grass-fed that would be also very good now if we
take a look at butter 1 tablespoon it's a little bit of protein and this could
be enough to stir up a reaction if you're very very sensitive 12 grams of
fat but no carb no lactose but ghee on the other hand has zero protein ghee
basically they take out all the protein from the fat and it's just pure fat and
no carbohydrates so if you're allergic to that casein you're not going to have
any problem with ghee at all now the other point I want to bring up is the
type of casein there's type a1 and there's type a2 type a1 tends to be more
inflammatory and this is the type of protein that you see in the United
States and Europe but not including France ok France uses a2 and other
countries might use a2 if you consume goat's milk cheese for example that
would be a2 you can also purchase dairy products from a2 cows and you may find
that it's less inflammatory less allergies so I'm just trying to give you
all the different reasons why you could react to dairy that go beyond
necessarily just the growth hormones now the thing about cheese too is the microbes
eat the lactose so you do have some probiotic in cheese and
other dairy products like kefir and yogurt but believe it or not yogurt does
not give near the probiotics as kefir but there is a little bit of probiotic
in cheese not all cheeses but some cheese if you're gonna consume cheese I
would recommend it be grass-fed organic and preferably raw if you can find it so
the point of this video is that if you have acne and you do keto and you still
have acne eliminate dairy and you're gonna find that the acne is probably
going to go away but I know some people love dairy and they're gonna have a hard
time doing that so maybe you want to try goat's cheese or you may want to try
100% grass-fed organic cheese maybe you won't have a reaction with that I
personally am from Wisconsin so of course I love cheese I do consume a
little bit of cheese it doesn't I don't seem to react to it
if I consume a large amount of cheese I don't feel quite right but a little bit
of high quality cheese for most people seems to be okay but again if you if you
have acne you may want to give it up but that may be the thing that totally
clears up all of your acne if you have not seen my other video on PCOS I put it
right here check it out

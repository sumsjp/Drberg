hey guys dr. berg here in this video I want to talk about low-calorie diets versus intermittent
fasting the confusion that people have is they think that it's the same exact thing no it's
completely the opposite thing so low-calorie diets actually slow your metabolism actually
it ruins your metabolism it's it takes the setpoint and it raises it so before
you could get your weight down to this way now it keeps rising and it was just like your body
gets comfortable at a certain weight like say 185 pounds and you can't seem to get below that
in a minute fasting if done correctly speeds up your metabolism it lowers as a setpoint it allows
your weight to go down it's the only thing that I know them as a tool that you can fix and heal
your metabolism okay so low calorie diets create a breakdown of muscle tissue it makes you weaker
over time intermittent fasting causes improvement in muscle and it retains protein and muscle tissue
and that's because of the hormone called growth hormone that's triggered when you do in a minute
fasting okay low calorie diets caused cravings to carbs and sweets it also keeps you hungry
because it's depriving you intermittent fasting you have no cravings you have no hunger so the
way that you know that you're in intermittent you're actually doing this correctly is when
your cravings go away if you're going to do a program then your craving you're not doing it
correctly and you're not really in fat-burning when you're doing this low calorie diets do not
put a person in fat-burning intermittent fasting does put a person in fat burning because it
influences hormones low-calorie diets ignores the hormone aspects of what calories influenced
so they don't look at how food triggers hormones insulin cortisol estrogen the basically saying
all calories are the same just eat in moderation just reduce your overall calorie bad advice intermittent
fasting done correctly looks at the hormone aspects like specifically insulin because when you
do intermittent fasting you're eating and then you're not eating and then you're eating and
you're not eating so you when you don't eat you don't trigger insulin when you do low calorie
diets a lot of times you're grazing and you're snacking but you're having just little amounts
of that thing low calorie diets typically ignore the nutrients in the calories these kind of look
at again a calorie is a calorie but there's certain calories that are more nutrient-dense
than others right so that's the difference so this is basically reduction of calorie this
is a reduction of frequency of eating this is not lowering your your calories when you eat so
when you do intermittent fasting correctly you want a meal of course that doesn't have sugar
you want a meal that has healthy fat you want a meal that has a moderate amount of protein and
you want a meal that is nutrient-dense a lot of vegetables but you're never going to be cutting
calories you're going to have a nice big meal menu that's suppose to get you to switch over
to fat burn when you're not eating going for a long period of time we're really talking like
if you did three meals a day or even twice a day and then not eating between them that's
the form of intermittent fasting but I just want to clarify the difference so you really get this
this is really bad this is really good alright thanks for watching put your comments below

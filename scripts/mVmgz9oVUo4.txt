so this one's going to make her a little
bit
taller she wants to be taller okay so we
take the massage device and we tuck it
up underneath the skull and your body is
on the pillow so we're tractioning it's
like the head's being tractioned forward
this way okay and I have just lift up
your head for a second I have the
smallest device here and it's right up
underneath the neck and we're just going
to hold that there tucking the chin
and after a while it's going to relax
and stretch like Saran wrap this way and
then when she sits up she's going to
feel her neck really loosen up because
it's going to take that compression and
just traction up okay so that's how you
would do um the back of the neck and
stretch out the top of the uh upper
spine

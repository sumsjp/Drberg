there's a very good remedy that you should take at the first sign
of a cold okay now what are some of the symptoms that would represent the first sign of a cold
runny nose cough sneeze itchy throat or scratchy throat could be a rhinovirus
coronavirus influenza there could be actually 200 different viruses and this is the remedy
that i'm going to recommend black elderberry and let me tell you why it's a very effective remedy
it's been used for a very long time and all of these symptoms right here are really symptoms of
inflammation the inflammation is what's creating the symptoms it's what's containing the pathogen
what's killing the pathogen and then ends up repairing all the damage that this inflammation
created and removing a lot of the inflammation out of the area and also concentrating the white
blood cells but black elderberry is a powerful immune modulator so it helps to regulate if the
immune system is overreacting if there's too much inflammation it can bring it down to a normal
cycle it also will help decrease the duration of the infection and the intensity of the infection
and if you can take it in the very beginning you can actually maybe even stop the whole cycle
from occurring now there's some other things that i would highly recommend taking as well
vitamin c i would recommend a natural food vitamin c about 500 milligrams would be good
zinc at least 50 milligrams of zinc which will help you a lot and vitamin d minimally

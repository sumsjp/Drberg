now here's a question can too much calcium
cause kidney stones well there are some studies that show that if
you're taking about 500 milligrams of calcium
carbonate which i never recommend because this is like consuming a stone
or cement that could increase the risk of kidney stones okay so so yes it's a
possibility now the other condition is when you have
hypercalcemia that's that could come from many different things
one cause would be taking massive doses of vitamin d i'm talking
about over a hundred thousand iu's over many months you could develop
hypercalcemia which could potentially lead to kidney stones
but the more likely cause of kidney stones is some type of
dysfunction within the kidney okay it's kidney damage from years of maybe eating
incorrectly and your body has a difficult time of getting rid of certain
things the most common kidney stone is calcium
oxalate stones one thing that you could do if you're
prone to getting kidney stones is make sure that the foods that you eat
are not high in oxalates okay here are some popular high oxalate
foods that are also keto friendly almonds
okay so you want to avoid these spinach now if you consume cheese at the same
time you're consuming spinach the oxalates in
the spinach will bind with the calcium in your digestive tract
and it won't get absorbed into the blood and out to the kidney
so that's one way to cope with that also when you steam spinach
you reduce the oxalates swiss chard is very high in oxalates
so you want to probably avoid that and chocolate can also
create a problem next thing low citrates okay how do you handle that you can
either take like potassium citrate or other minerals
that are in the citrate form or you can take lemon juice
and if you're prone to kidney stones you know two plus ounces
of lemon juice every single day is not a bad idea put it in your water
and if you have a kidney stone you probably want to take eight ounces
of lemon juice every single day because citrate helps dissolve
calcium oxalate stones all right next thing which is probably the most
important thing is you want to make sure you have enough
fluids at least 2.5 liters of fluid
if you're prone to kidney stones that's simply going to keep your urine from
becoming too concentrated so you're going to
make it really hard for your body to develop any stones just by doing this
right here some people we do three liters a day so
at least that that should help you next thing there are certain microbes
that help dissolve oxalate stones and there's some data that shows that
stones can develop if you're missing that microbe
and they're doing research right now as i speak on
giving people that microbe to help decrease the risk of stone
but it's unavailable for you to just buy commercially
however we do know that if there's a healthy microbiome
the risk of kidney stones goes down okay the other thing that you want to make
sure you're consuming is higher amounts of fiber because
fiber helps bind with calcium and oxalates together so have your
large salads of course not the spinach or the swiss chard
the other thing is bile if your gallbladder is working you have enough
bile salts this can also reduce the risk of kidney
stones because bile helps bind with calcium and oxalates as
well and some people use purify bowel salts
to help dissolve kidney stones all right so i

this video is going to answer a question someone wanted to know are those granola
bars keto friendly i decided just to do a whole video just on this one topic because
you know when you look on the label it says it's 100 natural they have this
beautiful image that you're in a farm it's natural it's oats and honey i mean come on
that's that sounds healthy there's nuts almonds there's walnuts there's peanuts
and there's no artificial flavoring or colorings okay so that sounds pretty darn healthy to me
but if you actually read the label you'll notice that there's whole oats whole oats are
obviously a little bit better than refined oats but they're still a carbohydrate
and the second ingredient is sugar now anytime you read the back of the label and you read the
ingredients the ingredients at the the first and second and third pretty much make up the majority
of that product so we have a good amount of oats we have a good amount of sugar then we have canola
oil this is omega-6 and it's gmo and omega-6 fatty acids can be inflammatory they're pro-inflammatory
which can worsen insulin resistance and create problems yellow corn flour is the next ingredient
it's very high in the glycemic index it's going to turn into sugar pretty quickly and then you
have soy flour it's probably going to be gmo because unless it's organic it's going to be gmo
and then they add more sugar as brown sugar syrup we've got baking soda and natural
flavoring so we've got one two three four five six seven eight so six out of the eight ingredients
are going to affect your blood sugars so the sugars total about 29 grams per serving with
added sugar of 12 grams that's three teaspoons of added sugar in two bars so that would be one
serving size because i think they come in two bars per package now at the very bottom
it says carbohydrate choice two i had to look up what that meant and this is a
rating scale and i think it was developed by the academy of nutrition on dietetics
now if your choice one that that's like 15 grams of sugar i think it goes up to five maybe it goes
higher but this relates to kind of a point system with carbohydrates now when i start to look into
this this is what they recommend for men you can have between four and five which comes out to
60 to 75 grams of carbs per meal okay so that's a lot of carbohydrates
but if you're a female it's three to four so that's 45 grams to 60 grams of carbs per meal now
also on the same document they're talking about a diabetic and so if you're a diabetic
they're still allowing these as long as you take your medication to control your blood sugars and
so their suggestion is to maintain that carb level so it doesn't throw off your medication because
if you're taking less carb you're going to need less medication isn't the goal to have less blood
sugars so why would you want to add more carb so you have to take more medication to regulate this
excessive amount of carb so anyway these somewhat natural granola bars might appear to be very very
natural and maybe they are but there sure is a lot of carbohydrate and it's not keto friendly
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

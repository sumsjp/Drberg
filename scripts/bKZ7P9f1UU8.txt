so there's nothing worse than having depression and being given no solutions
you go to the doctor and they want to load you up with prescription
medications and you ask the doctor how long do I have to take this medication
before I can come off the medication and they may say that you may never be able
to come off of it the problem is these medications have some serious side
effects you become addicted you need more
medications and then the effectiveness becomes less and less and less so there
never seems to be a point where you're cured or things are resolved where you
can now come off the medication though there's several things you want to do
one is definitely look at your diet if you're new to my channel I'll put some
links down below of some very important videos related to healthy keto and in a
minute fasting as well as taking vitamin D but there's something else that is
very very important and it's fixing your gut there is a huge connection between
what's going on in your large intestine and your overall mood there's quite a
bit of research on this and I'll put some links down below a major depressive
disorder and they're finding that there's high levels of certain microbes
okay and there's low level of other microbes in your gut and apparently
these microbes have a huge influence on your overall mood and there's one
microbe that can actually create some serious benefits for someone who is
depressed and that is the lactobacillus Bifidobacterium which is in yogurt and
if you're gonna get yogurt I would always recommend getting the Bulgarian
yogurt high quality high fat yogurt you can also get this microbe and kimchi
which is a Korean fermented cabbage dish and then sauerkraut is also a fermented
cabbage cheese has this microbe in it kefir and even pickles now the question
is why would this microbe actually help increase your mood well it helps make
certain neurotransmitters like gaba and serotonin and other microbes can make
neurotransmitters like dopamine and even acetylcholine and if you think about
it when someone's on a psychiatric medication
what is that attempting to do that is attempting to manipulate your
neurotransmitters the problem is that the mechanism that they're using has way
too many side effects there really is no side effects of it reestablishing your
normal flora simply because that's supposed to be there
normally replenishing the gut with this microbe can reestablish the normal Gaba
levels serotonin levels as well as b1 and other B vitamins these microbes make
vitamins and one of the most important B vitamins that you need for your mood is
vitamin b1 if you have depression start consuming these foods on a regular basis
or find a good probiotic that has this right here thanks for watching and I put
another video on what you should be eating if you're depressed check it out
it's right here

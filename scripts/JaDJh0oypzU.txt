i want to talk about the number one mistake that doctors make in treating heartburn they
alkalize the stomach with things like ppi's proton pump inhibitors and the number one being nexium
and number two is prilosec did you realize between the year 1992 and 2017
nexium alone just that one ppi produced over 72 billion dollars so these ppis are one of the most
widely sold medications in the world and i think there's about eight of them
and they're used to treat indigestion ulcers gerd gastritis and of course then the doctor will tell
you to you know eat more fiber in the form of whole grains avoid fat and then eat bland foods
like crackers but here's the problem the grains alkalize the stomach and i think the missing link
is not fully understanding the significance and the importance of having a very acidic stomach
your stomach normally should be between one and three that's extremely acidic and within a stomach
like that you should be able to digest pretty much anything but you need that acid in your stomach
to kill pathogens to break down proteins and to help you absorb minerals but if you look up data
on heartburn as far as the cause of it it'll say well you're consuming acidic foods you're eating
a high fat diet too many fried foods spicy foods and gerd and if you look up the cause of gerd it
will say well the cause is acid reflux but they're not really looking deeper than that unfortunately
and then the patient starts taking these ppis and they get side effects here are the side effects
abdominal pain gas constipation osteoporosis sarcopenia that's the loss of muscle mass
myopathies muscle problems probably because they can no longer absorb amino acids anymore
c diff which is a pathogen anxiety because you need these amino acids to make neurotransmitters
sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth fungal overgrowth pneumonia kidney disease but other than
that you're going to be perfectly fine so what is the real cause of heartburn well it is those
things that weaken the stomach acids heartburn most the time comes from a lack of acid okay and
then the body will start overcompensating and it starts producing more and that comes mainly from
your diet too many refined grains too many sugars too many processed foods etc so this is what i
want you to know the weaker a person's digestive system is i'm not just talking about the stomach
i'm talking about any part of the digestive system the more they need to enhance the digestive system
with adding more acids like betaine hydrochloride which is a natural thing apple cider vinegar
to re-establish the ph add purified bile salts which will assist the gallbladder in helping
you digest fats add probiotics to help you digest fiber and also realize that if your system is weak
you're going to have a harder time breaking down raw foods so you're going to have to steam
your vegetables or cook them and even eat less of them until you can reestablish this acidic ph and
ferment your vegetables like in sauerkraut pickles and other vegetables very very important that way
you can lessen the plant chemicals like oxalates phytates lectins and tannins that can just tear
up your intestines and also fattier meat is much easier to digest than leaner meat and i think that
has to do with number one you're able to stimulate more bile production and help more digestion what
stimulates bile is fatty foods so the leaner the protein the less bile production the less you're
going to be able to get help from your gallbladder when you're digesting and also chewing your food a
lot longer is going to help you if you're going to stimulate more digestive enzymes that way
germinating your nuts like soaking them overnight would also help so i just wanted to give you some
tips on helping those people that have a weaker digestive system and also increase
your awareness and the harmful effects of some of these medications in fact when i was in college
i had heartburn so bad and i had no idea what was causing it of course i was eating pure refined
carbohydrates and tons of grains but low fat lean proteins of course i had very little awareness
on health i was taking tums just like candy all day long until i get an ulcer
so that just went on for years and years and years in fact for breakfast i remember eating
a lot of cereal and muffins thinking that was the thing to do but little did i know
it was weakening my system over time so it wasn't until i really understood the significance of
the stomach acid that i started to turn things around and completely get rid of those symptoms
thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

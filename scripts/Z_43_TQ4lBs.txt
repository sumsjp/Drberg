let's talk about the foods that can potentially boost libido both in men and women so we're
talking about foods that have an aphrodisiac effect so i first want to tell you if you're not
sleeping if you have too much chronic stress if you consume a high carb high sugar diet
then none of these are going to work because these will very easily nullify
libido so testosterone is the hormone that tends to increase the libido in both men and women
but of course with women they don't need much because if they have too much testosterone or
other androgens what's going to happen is they're going to get facial hair and they're going to get
a deeper voice and they'll lose their hair on the top of their head and a lot of other issues so
we're just talking about the right balance now anything that increases estrogen too much
will lower testosterone and lower libido and that would be alcohol dairy
too much dairy could potentially give you too much estrogen and of course soy soy oil soy protein
isolates can lower testosterone and then tap water um make sure you get a filter there are
all sorts of chemicals and hormones in tap water including estrogen so that can be a big problem
all right so let's say these are handled right here okay pistachios pistachios are high in this
amino acid called arginine which increases nitric oxide which guess how viagra works by increasing
nitric oxide and so pistachios can help to a certain degree and also selenium can increase
not just fertility but can actually help healthy testosterone levels all right number two oysters
why because out of all the foods out there oysters have the most zinc and zinc is one of the most
powerful minerals to increase testosterone levels also oysters have copper which also can help
testosterone levels as well as selenium all right number three coffee coffee will do two things if
you have too much that can lower testosterone if you have just a little bit that can help
the caffeine and the polyphenols will help support healthy testosterone levels and then
we get this herb called saffron it's very very expensive but they even use it to treat depression
it can increase your mood and it can increase fertility and then we have number five maca root
they call it the peruvian viagra it can increase testosterone number six asparagus in asparagus
you have this natural steroid building block that can actually help you increase your testosterone
levels of course we're not talking about you know the steroids that someone would inject
themselves with as a bodybuilder all right next one truffles so truffles are a type of mushroom
there's been some interesting studies that it can increase testosterone all right number eight beets
can increase nitric oxide like pistachios now if you're on keto make sure you don't do too many
beets because they are a bit higher in sugar but a small amount is going to be totally fine
but again none of these are going to create any effect unless you're sleeping keep your stress
down and you're on a low carb diet and of course exercise also will help too all right thanks for

what is the difference between mct oil and coconut oil now realize mct oil is extracted from coconut
oil with mct oil we're dealing mainly with medium chain triglycerides now another name for medium
chain triglycerides is medium chain fatty acids there are three main categories of fatty acids
you have the medium chain fatty acids or mct fats which is right in the middle part okay then
you have the small chain fatty acids then you have the long chain fatty acids and so with mcto you're
getting just the medium chain fatty acids and with coconut oil you are getting mct fats but only 15
versus a hundred percent on the mct oil and so if you're trying to get the mct fats with coconut oil
you're going to get just a tiny bit of it you're going to get a lot of other stuff um and you're
also going to get the long chain fatty acids like 45 with a very small amount of the medium
chain fatty acids and they also broke down the specific type of fatty acids with each category
it's not that you needed to know that but i just wanted to include that if you were interested
all right so what are the advantages of taking mct oil well number one you're going to get a lot
faster digestion and absorption the mct oils are going to go on very fast versus the coconut oil
takes a lot longer to digest now with the mct fats you're going to get a much faster conversion
into ketones so you're going to get these medium chain triglycerides that are going to all convert
to ketones versus coconut oil you're only going to get 15 of it converting to ketones now mct fats
are really good for people with outer gallbladder or with people that have problems with the
gallbladder or problems with your liver because mct fats don't use bile now with coconut oil it's
great when you're cooking with something because it doesn't smoke when you have the high heat
also coconut oil significantly increases hdl it's great for the skin it can even decrease plaquing
it's good for gingivitis it's good for your immune system so it definitely has other great benefits
now with mct oil it's great to increase energy it's great for brain support okay it's also good
for like i said before gallbladder problems it's excellent if you have insulin resistance
it's good to take if you're starting a ketogenic plan or fasting to help you go longer so you're
not hungry and you can add it to your coffee you can add it to your salad dressing or just put it
right on your salad or just take some with a spoon but just realize that when you first start taking
this you want to start off small and gradually increase it because your body has to get used
to it if you take too much too fast you may have digestive problems and one last point
i want to bring up with mct oil i sell an mct oil product now most of the mct oil products out there
mainly get it from one source so a lot of it is pretty much the same i mean if you look at what
other companies are charging for mct oil they're jacking up the price way too high so definitely
do your research on the comparison of different products out there but you're going to find a
huge difference in some products that are just way too expensive all right thanks for watching

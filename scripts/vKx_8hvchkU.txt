in a study involving 210 people over 24 weeks age garlic was shown to be just as effective
as a 10 law for hypertension i put the link down below check it out now before taking this advice
check with your doctor okay now why would someone take aged garlic because it has less side effects
okay and it was found to be just as effective for hypertension problem with atenolol it has
some side effects like blurred vision cold hands confusion difficulty breathing dizziness excessive
sweating tightness in your chest fatigue and wheezing now why would age garlic work
well mainly the isolated it's effective due to this phytonutrient called allicin now
allicin has a lot of very cool effects one being anti-cancer but the other being anti-hypertensive
okay so it can decrease something called angiotensin ii which can help relax the blood
vessels and reduce hypertension it can increase nitric oxide which can help reduce hypertension
it can decrease inflammation which can lower your blood pressure it can thin your blood reducing the
chance of clotting and with a lot less side effects now when we're talking about garlic
aged garlic can work better than fresh garlic now i'm not telling you not to take fresh garlic
but if you're going to do fresh garlic definitely crush it and wait at least 15 minutes before
consuming it because you want to release more of the allicin compound but overall aged garlic has
more allicin more phytonutrients more antioxidants than fresh garlic it was found to inhibit
advanced glycation end products by 56.4 percent compared to using fresh garlic
there's only a reduction of 33.5 percent now what are these advanced glycation end products
basically there are these things that combine a sugar to a protein and it makes the protein
unavailable and this protein that's unavailable to your body kind of clogs everything up
it's involved in a lot of chronic health problems when you're eating junk food and you're eating a
lot of sugar so garlic especially aged garlic has some pretty powerful anti-glycation effects

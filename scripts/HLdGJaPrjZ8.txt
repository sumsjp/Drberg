all right so i know some of you are going to laugh when i tell you this technique
but hear me out walking backwards can help your not just knee pain
but your back pain in a big way now there's other terms for this called retro walking and
there's some other terms but the point is this when you're walking you are developing certain
muscles especially the psoas muscle which is in the in the abdomen area the quads some of the
shoulder muscles usually you're leaning forward like this when you're walking and so it kind of
throws your body out of balance if you do a lot of walking or running when you do reverse walking
you strengthen your glutes your hamstrings which is in the back part of the legs
the front part of the lower leg which is called the anterior tibialis some of the core muscles
and you're also activating different parts of your brain and neurology so there's a lot of benefits
of walking backwards you're going to notice that your knee pain especially if it's on the
front part of your knee is going to diminish and your back is going to feel better because you're
strengthening the glutes and the hamstrings so it kind of throws the body back into a balance
you may also notice that your posture is better and even your coordination is better but here's
the thing okay before you do this check with your doctor because the last thing i want to do is
have someone start running backwards and trip and then blame it on me so i am not going to
be responsible for that you want to go really slow at first walk on a flat surface do it in a
place that there's no big rocks that you can trip over or anything you can trip over maybe you want
to start on a treadmill so you can actually hold yourself and go slow and work up to this
you're going to feel like you just had a workout just from a small distance it's quite interesting
but you're going to definitely feel better on your knee and your back and you're going to
be standing more erect and of course if you're out doing this in public don't mention my name

have you noticed that your child's a little clumsy or not coordinated so in this video
i want to talk about the potential for a nutritional deficiency the reason may not
be something they're just normally born with but there's an actual underlying
nutritional deficiency so let's talk about this topic there is a condition called ataxia
ataxia comes from the greek word meaning lack of order so ataxia is a condition where the left
side of the body is not coordinated with the right there's gait abnormalities with walking
coordinated movements muscle movements and the inability to judge distances so let's say you're
going to shoot a football and you completely overshoot or undershoot now that could be
a lack of training in that sport or it could be maybe a subclinical version of ataxia now if you
look at the underlying causes for ataxia there's all sorts of things from brain tumor to cancer
to head injury but there's some other interesting causes as well
and one big interesting cause would be a vitamin b1 deficiency i mean if you think about a severe
case of b1 deficiency called beriberi one big effect is destruction of neurons in your brain
because the vitamin b1 is involved in so many things in the body including brain function
myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves digestion cardiovascular function and impairment to certain
parts of your brain now before i talk more about b1 i want to talk about other causes of ataxia
alcohol is one trigger certain drugs will cause ataxia lithium can cause ataxia a buildup of
mercury can cause ataxia a severe b12 deficiency can cause it having gluten sensitivity can cause
ataxia in fact there's a condition called gluten ataxia which i'm going to do a separate video
on where gluten the protein in certain grains can actually destroy neurons in your brain so there's
many things that can cause ataxia but what's not talked about very often is the relationship
between vitamin b1 deficiency and ataxia and the primary way which a child would become deficient
in vitamin b1 would be consuming too much refined rice too much refined grain and too much
sugar not to mention gluten as well vitamin b1 is in the bran which is the fiber part
of the grain i'm talking about rice as well in fact a very severe b1 deficiency is called
beriberi and that was originally discovered by certain communities consuming too much
milled or refined polished rice i mean how many children are living on refined carbohydrates in
sugar i mean it's probably the vast majority now if you consume whole grains with the bran
it's filled with phytates and that can block zinc another deficiency that shows up in a very
large population of children what i'm saying is if your child is not as coordinated as they should be
start to get them off these refined grains and sugar
and give them some b1 and see if it doesn't clear up before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

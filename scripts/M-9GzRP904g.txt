so let's talk about hot flashes I've done quite a few videos and hot flashes
from different angles so just to give you the basics we have this little gland
in your brain called the hypothalamus and there's a certain part of the
hypothalamus that is controlling the release of the egg from the ovaries
every month in your cycle so it controls the menstrual cycle and it works through
this pituitary gland which is kind of like the middle map what happens is when
you start menstruating let's say you're I don't know 12 13 years old and every
month you're releasing an egg and you're leasing an egg and roughly about 400
eggs you have okay so when you exhaust 400 roughly you should be around 52
years old and then your ovaries should stop working because you're probably not
planning on getting pregnant and so you lose the ovarian function and with that
comes a loss of certain hormones when you lose the ovary and it's hormones
thank goodness you have a backup organ called the adrenals the adrenals make
the same hormones as the ovaries just not in the same amounts the same
quantities during menopause certain things can happen hot flashes night
sweats anxiety depression stress muscle loss bone breakdown all these things can
happen so there's various things that you can do to improve this whole thing
typically the first thing I would tell people to do is to strengthen the back
up organ the adrenals and there's a there's a whole bunch of things you can
do especially to make sure you're sleeping make sure your stress is low
because we want to reduce cortisol okay and I'll put some links down below for
information on that and that may just solve the whole thing
the major storage site for vitamin E is the pituitary so when you lose this
cycle okay many times you can drop your vitamin E levels and vitamin E is needed
for all these sex hormones so one remedy for hot flashes that's pretty effective
is to take a very high quality vitamin E complex including all the tocopherols
and all of the tocotrienols together as one complex now the
other thing that works for hot flashes is taking iodine from sea kelp why
because this helps estrogen dominance now this is kind of strange because as
you age estrogen should decrease it does but the other opposing hormone called
progesterone really takes a nosedive so we have this relative severe
progesterone deficiency with a moderate amount of deficiency with estrogen and
if we look at that ratio it will give you an estrogen dominance and so there's
estrogen that's not up being a post or countered it creates problems in this
circuitry right here not to mention if you have extra body fat that body fat
can then make more estrogen to after menopause and give you even more
estrogen so taking iodine can really work if you have an estrogen dominant
situation but there's some other things that also work for estrogen dominance so
let's talk about deliver now the big purpose of the liver is to detoxify
chemicals poison heavy metals and excess hormones it removes hormones if there's
an excessive amount of them as an estrogen dominance it will also remove
excess amounts of cortisol there's too much but it can only do that if it's
working and the problem is when you reach age 50 too many times the liver is
either fatty or it has problems and it's just not working efficiently so another
solution that really really is effective is to support the liver if you have hot
flashes night sweats and issues because if we can get the estrogen to a normal
level you can actually resolve the hot flashes and be able to sleep at night so
there's a couple things you can do that are pretty effective you can take
cruciferous in a concentrated form or even cruciferous vegetables you know
kale broccoli radish arugula things like that or dim
which is a concentrated cruciferous you can get this in a supplement like one
pill is equivalent to two pounds of broccoli so it's a real good helpful
compound to detoxify the liver but there's another really amazing remedy
called calcium D blue car eight your body makes a little of this but if the
liver is not working you might need more you can get this as a supplement I don't
have a brand name to recommend you can just look in different products and read
the reviews but what this compound does it's very effective at helping detoxify
estrogen and also ammonia if you if you consume too much protein one study it
shows that it decreases estrogen by 23% and it will decrease the receptors for
estrogen by nearly 50% right there it's going to pull you out of this estrogen
dominant situation it also increases the liver circulation with very minimal side
effects if any so I just wanted to create this video to give you some
options to look at if you have hot flashes and try different things thanks
for watching with another amazing recipe no grains no sugar

hi guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about chronic postnasal drip okay there's
two types one type it's all year round it's not related to seasons necessarily and then the other
version is like seasonal we have this post nasal drip that's basically an allergy let's talk about
this one first in this situation there's a there's a very stubborn resilient fungus or mole growing
in your sinuses okay and that's creating this mucus one of the only things I know that kills
this thing well there's two things one is garlic I'm going to put a link down below of how to use
the garlic nose nettie flesh but this is a really good one too it's oregano oil you can either take
the couple drops and put it in a shot glass with water and drink it through the day or better yet
you can just can take the pearls these are this oil in a pearl and consume those through the day
and this is my favorite it's actually get a neti pot well you could take some either take a pearl
and take a little bit of the oil and put it in the water and heat it up and let the vapors go up into
the sinuses but remember it's very very strong so just go light at first but but this will be very
very good to actually kill off that the colonies of fungus and mold up into the sinuses so that's
what you're going to do of course the other two things make sure that you don't feed the fungus
or mold what it likes to consume which is sugar and milk sugar - like milk and sugar avoid those
two things okay and try to avoid antibiotics if at all possible so that's what you do for that and
then we have the seasonal allergies okay this is a situation where you have high levels of histamine
and that's where you get all the mucus and runny nose and that whole thing there is a natural
remedy for that and it's called it's a type of vitamin C and is a synthetic calcium ascorbate
okay you can take it in like a gram several times a day and you mix it with water I would get
the one with bioflavonoids okay this is the only time one of the only times that I would recommend
taking a synthetic vitamin C because you need large amounts dismantle the histamines it breaks
down histamine it speeds up the immune system to help clear out mucus so you can consume that
you'll feel like within you know like a couple minutes after you'll start feeling like a draining
and clearing up of the mucus so that's a really good remedy to take a few grams through the day
spread out with the bioflavonoids so you can get calcium ascorbate okay alright thanks for watching

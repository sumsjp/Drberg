let's talk about fodmaps in relationship to ibd and ibs now what do these acronyms
stand for let's start with fodmaps okay so that stands for fermentable which basically describes
the gut bacteria digesting carbohydrates and producing gas okay that's fermentable
then we oligosaccharides oligo means few and saccharides describe sugars then we
get disaccharides that means two sugars connected then we have monosaccharides which is one sugar
and then we have polyols and these are basically scientifically sounding names for carbohydrates
specifically sugar and fiber and all of these are a bit more difficult to digest all right now let's
switch over to ibs that's irritable bowel syndrome and then we have ibd which is inflammatory bowel
disease now the difference between ibs and ibd is this an ibs there's no ulcers there's no
lesions it only affects the colon not the small intestine so basically you have inflammation in
your large intestine all right ibd is irritable about disease it's a group of bowel diseases that
cause inflammation in different parts of the gi system okay both ibs and ibd are triggered
by the same thing gluten which is the protein in wheat and other grains refined sugars
grains lactose that's milk sugar certain fibers in a lot of things like vegetables legumes and
omega-6 fatty acids that would be things like soy corn canola especially the oils and then if
you have these conditions you'll have abdominal pain diarrhea bloating and gas so what happens
in the gut when you actually consume these foods is you get gas and the gas stretches and expands
the colon and ibd or ibs are very sensitive to this stretching because you have inflammation now
let me just circle back to the fodmaps for a second illegal saccharides that would be
like the grains that would be garlic onions legumes an example of disaccharides would be
the dairy okay so as you know a lot of people are real sensitive to dairy right
and then monosaccharides would be like fructose and that could be like in high fructose corn
syrup or fruit and then polyols would be like the artificial sweeteners like sorbitol mannitol but
these two compounds sorbitol and mannitol are also in to a certain degree in fruit
and even vegetables so the whole concept of fodmaps is to consume foods low in fodmaps okay
now i listed all of those in the description below so you can see what i'm going to talk about
because you'd also want to avoid the high five map foods okay now here's one little extra point
i want to bring up many people consume the low fodmap vegetables and other foods and they still
have a lot of gi problems in that case i would recommend not consuming any vegetables or legumes
or fruits and do carnivore for a couple months and you'll find that your gut can heal and you'll feel
much much better i just wanted to point that out but just make sure you do the healthy version
of a carnivore diet so you're not just eating animal protein you're eating fish
seafood eggs things like that hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

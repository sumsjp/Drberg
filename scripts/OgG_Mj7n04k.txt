hi guys so this is a true story someone asked this question keto doesn't
work because i did it for a month it did help
me but when i went back to my normal eating
my normal diet after a month the hypoglycemia came
back so this is one of those frustrating things because obviously they missed
something or i did not do a good job of explaining it enough
but let's just talk about this okay so when you have hypoglycemia that's low
blood sugars what's causing the low blood sugars
is something you ate that's triggering insulin that's
pushing your blood sugars down so when you have hypoglycemia
low blood sugar and then you think oh i have a low blood sugar i need to consume
sugar right to get it back to normal the problem is
you're just going to activate insulin again
and that's going to bring it back back down so
you will never in a million years correct hypoglycemia
by consuming more carbohydrates so what you're missing is the understanding
of this hormone right here secondly you did the program for one month it's
not long enough if you have hypoglycemia you have very
severe insulin resistance that's been probably
going on for many many years it could take several years before you
can even get into a stabilized position and then when you go back to carbs
you're just gonna put it right back this is a good analogy uh i started
drinking a lot i became an alcoholic okay i got sick so then i actually
stopped drinking and i felt better but then i went back
to drinking and now i'm sick again so that's the same situation as what we're
talking about right here your normal diet okay
is not normal keto and IF is designed to be a lifestyle
change a long-term diet this is a normal diet right here
this is not a normal diet right here in summary
get back on the wagon continue to do keto and IF
and just make it part of your lifestyle before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto

not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to

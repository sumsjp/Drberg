now it's interesting because when people are first introduced to fasting
they might think starvation anti-survival but it's actually frequent eating that equals anti-survival
if we take a look at many wild animals they're not eating all day long i mean a lion can
basically 90 pounds of meat in one feeding yet can go weeks without food bears go an entire
winter without eating and of course when you domesticate an animal and you feed your pets too
frequent you give them treats they get fat and in the wild the only fat animals like penguins seals
whales basically have a fat layer around them to survive in the cold waters but they don't have the
visceral fat the fat around the organs like humans have but humans are very similar to animals as
regard to fasting it was only within the last 10,000 years where we had the agricultural revolution
that men start getting into trouble with chronic diseases i mean nowadays you actually have stores
that are available 24-7 you have stores called 7-eleven they're open seven days a week providing
you with quick energy foods people actually have several refrigerators and freezers and cupboards
that are completely stuck with food that you will never run out so we have a massive temptation
we have people that have low willpower and on top of that our bodies are running on
glucose not fat fuel so we have this constant blood sugar problem constant craving for carbs
constant hungry throughout the day so it's really a deadly combination of the available food
and craving for that available food but from an evolutionary standpoint our bodies
were designed not to eat so frequently we have way more hormones involved with releasing fuel
fat burning than we do for storing fuel we have glucagon growth hormone adrenaline
cortisol thyroid hormones somatostatin acth all these hormones are designed with releasing energy
between meals when you're fasting we only really have one hormone that's involved with
storing extra fuel this means that our bodies were designed to not eat
so frequently eating too frequently goes against the very programming of our genetics so the
benefit of fasting is huge i'm going to put a link down below of an interesting video i just released

the macadamia nut one of my favorite nuts on keto why well per cup it has a great amount of fat
it has a low amount of carb and actually somewhat low protein and that's actually
good when you're doing the ketogenic diet because i'm always trying to find
things to eat that are fattier that don't necessarily have too much protein because i'm
usually going to do animal fat for my protein but then i need to add some fat to increase the ratios
to have a little more fat than protein so this is just a nut that has the most fat of any nuts
okay monounsaturated fats 79 grams that's huge okay monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated
these are the ones that create the oxidation the artery problems the inflammation
these don't okay so these this is pro-inflammatory this is not and this
only has like two grams so this is a really good ratio it has 16 grams of saturated fat
let me just put that down right here net carb of seven grams so we're allowed 30 to 50 grams so
we're just dealing with seven grams for one cup that's pretty good all right protein is 11 grams
one thing about macadamia nuts i've noticed that um you want to really make sure you buy
fresh because sometimes um i've purchased them in the past and they're they're
probably been sitting on the shelf for a very long time they're kind of rancid even though
they have a very long shelf life so you know you just want to make make note of that
also realize that macadamia nuts are toxic to dogs just like xylitol is it can make them weak they
can also develop what's called hind limb paralysis okay so don't let your dogs consume this nut
number one very high in fat low in carb love it number two increase in omega
7 fats okay which has an effect of increasing your hdl and decreasing your ldl it can also help
stabilize glucose improve insulin sensitivity so it's going to help your blood sugars
and even decrease inflammation also these nuts are high in b1 i mean it has massive amounts of b1
copper good amounts of manganese magnesium and iron and b6 and many other nutrients so
a really good thing would be to have a little handful of macadamia nuts right after a meal
just to help you feel more satisfied hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

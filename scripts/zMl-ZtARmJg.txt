now in my show last week someone had a question about having a high pulse rate every time she
started keto her pulse rate would go up and then she would get off keto it would come back
down and she want to know what is behind that so let's talk about that now when you do keto
you're lowering your carbohydrates but going on a keto diet doesn't necessarily require you to
increase other nutrients it's really just about lowering your carbs so as long as you lower your
carbs you produce ketones and you're on the ketogenic diet but there's a version of the
ketogenic diet which i always recommend called healthy keto and what that means is this you're
doing low carb but you're also making sure you're eating foods to include all the nutrients that
your body requires one of the interesting things that happens when you go low carb
is that you are no longer holding on to a lot of your glucose the glucose that's stored
glycogen and this especially occurs when you do fasting so if you're combining keto with fasting
because just within a day you can lose a lot of your glycogen which is store glucose in your liver
and what you need to know is that glycogen is a sponge that holds a lot of fluid you see when you
store fat as out of position you're not storing any fluid at all it's only when you store glucose
so you get on the ketogenic diet so you're dumping all this fluid guess what you're also going to
lose potassium magnesium your electrolytes so unless you're putting these electrolytes back
into the diet you could end up with a higher pulse rate because magnesium and especially potassium
have a function of keeping your pulse rate regulated and at a lower amount and this is also
why when someone starts to increase more refined carbohydrates their pulse rate goes up because
it takes potassium to store these carbohydrates as glycogen so the more glycogen you have you
can lock up some of this potassium so both a high carbohydrate diet can cause a potassium deficiency
and a low carbohydrate diet could also cause a potassium deficiency if you're not consuming
enough so very simply start consuming a lot more vegetables or take potassium as a supplement
now there's one other nutrient deficiency that can create a high pulse rate and that is low
vitamin b1 thiamine so if by taking potassium you still have a high pulse rate then add some b1
or nutritional yeast and that should handle it before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

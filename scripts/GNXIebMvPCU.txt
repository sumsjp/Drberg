so we're going to talk about why cod liver oil
can help someone with eczema now what is this skin condition
it's a condition where you have this red scaly flaky
rash on your skin it's another name for this condition being
atopic dermatitis and then you have psoriasis which is in the same family
they're all related but let's talk about why
cod liver oil is one of the best remedies
for pretty much any skin problem you have
fish oils are high in omega-3 fatty acids we're talking about dha and epa
but cod liver oil has two additional things
vitamin a and vitamin d so if we start with vitamin a deficiencies one of the
symptoms is follicular hyperkeratosis now what is
that that's a condition where you have these
little red or brown dots by your hair follicles it could be on your arm
or your back and let me just flash the picture up so you can see what that
looks like i just want to show you the relationship between a vitamin a
deficiency and what it can do for your skin there's
another condition called cirrhosis also it looks like a
very dried out skin appearance with these little
wrinkles around these scales vitamin a has everything to do with skin
integrity and then we get vitamin d now psoriasis has this appearance as well
with some more plaquing but psoriasis is an autoimmune
condition and vitamin d is the best remedy for
any autoimmune condition now why because vitamin d is an anti-inflammatory
it acts like cortisol in the body without the side effects
and cortisol is an anti-inflammatory it's used in a lot of skin issues
vitamin d in higher amounts is really good for psoriasis and pretty much any
type of dermatitis including this right here atopic
dermatitis which basically is eczema right there cod liver oil has
vitamin a and vitamin d and cod liver oil has
omega-3 fatty acids dha and epa these are
part of essential fatty acids and if you look up essential fatty acid
deficiency guess what one of the big symptoms
is dermatitis which is scaly dry skin by taking cod of oil you have
the combination of omega-3 dha and epa you have vitamin d and
vitamin a all in one if you're going to take cod liver oil
it's very very important to reduce your omega-6 fatty acids
if you're not familiar with what these are
i put a link down below but it's merely a matter of increasing the omega-3
and decreasing the omega-6 for your skin and i want to bring up one point about a
lot of people that do keto they focus on these fats right here
coconut oil and butter in their diet and cooking
which is great and hopefully they're reducing the other
oils even safflower oil or sunflower oil and
the other cooking oils but here's the thing coconut oil
has zero omega-3 fatty acids and butter has only tiny tiny
traces of omega-3 fatty acids so you're not going to get your omega-3
from coconut or butter you're going to have to get it
from fish sardines like salmon or just cod liver oil

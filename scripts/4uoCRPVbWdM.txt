now your resting pulse rate can give you some idea on how long you actually have to live now
there are other better indicators that will predict mortality like the coronary artery
calcification test if you haven't seen that video i put a link down below but your resting
pulse rate can give you some good information to predict your mortality to a certain degree
and i'm not just talking about cardiovascular deaths i'm talking about deaths from all causes
so based on a meta-analysis which i'll put the data down below mortality increased by 9
for every 10 beats per minute of resting heart rate now what does that actually mean
it means that if your pulse rate is low let's say it's 45 beats per minute you have a low risk of
dying and if your pulse rate is higher let's say it's 90 beats per minute you have a significantly
higher risk of dying from something so the goal is to monitor your arresting pulse rate just to kind
of give you an idea where you're at and also to do things to to bring it down well-trained athletes
have very low pulse rates i'm talking like 40 45 50. that's all really really low and of course
people with cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease arrhythmias high blood pressure typically
have a higher resting pulse rate which puts them more at risk now i do want to make a note here
if you are on a medication that is bringing your pulse rate down
that's not what you want to go by you want to go by a resting heart rate without any help doing any
manipulation of your heart rate that will give you the true number another study i want to make note
um found that postmenopausal women with a pulse rate of 76 beats per minute if you compare that to
women with lower pulse rate at a 26 increase risk of heart attacks okay so anyway it's it's
one indicator it's not the whole picture but it's something to look at and it's a very cheap test to
do because you just basically need to measure your pulse you can even use your two fingers
and look at your watch and see how many beats within one minute it comes out to so what controls
your pulse rate something called the vagal tone the vagus nerve which is a very long nerve
and it comes out of your brain stem and it goes into a lot of different organs but it goes right
to the heart as well and the blood vessels of the heart and the things that control the rhythm of
the heart and so this vagus nerve is under the parasympathetic control parasympathetic
has to do with rest and digest it's an active type wave in the body that pushes things down and helps
recover things for example let's say you exercise really really hard for a minute okay and you
checked your pulse rate before and then right at the end of the exercise so it's going to be high
and then you kept checking your pulse rate after a minute and then two minutes and three minutes
the faster that pulse rate comes down the faster the recovery the stronger the vagal tone or vagus
nerve or parasympathetic nervous system that is pushing that wave down and the same thing
in a resting state your parasympathetic nervous system is supposed to keep your pulse rate nice
and low and that is your recovery system so there are various things that you can do to strengthen
your vagal tone or your parasympathetics number one exercise consistent regular exercise
with a catch the catch is this you must be able to recover because if you over
train you're going to end up with a lower recovery so you need to make sure that you don't over train
next thing is sleep yeah sleep recently i've been doing an experiment with my body
by just sleeping more i'm sleeping like nine hours and i'm liking it a lot i've been sleeping for six
hours for years you know with this idea that i don't need much sleep i can just take a nap
but then i compared it to sleeping longer i mean nine hours is excessive i'll probably end up going
to eight hours but wow do i feel better with nine hours of sleep incredible and i have more mental
cognitive function i'm in a better mood so you might want to actually try that one too but more
sleep is going to help your recovery especially of the heart all right the next one and this might
be a big shocker for most of you fasting okay it's not a big shocker all right next one is
low carb okay when you combine a low carb diet with fasting you strengthen the parasympathetic
you take someone out of the sympathetic flutter fight mode and put them more into a calming
recovery state and by the way when you're on a low carb you're eating less sugar when you eat
refined sugar that depletes you of the next two things which have to do with keeping your pulse
rate in check and that would be having enough potassium a potassium deficiency okay can cause
your pulse rate to go higher and one cause of a potassium deficiency is consuming a lot of refined
sugar and refined grains okay so potassium is a real key mineral to help push down that pulse
rate so that means getting enough potassium from your diet whether it's from supplement or
a lot of salad vitamin b1 is the next thing and uh if you don't have enough b1 your pulse rate
can go up and it just so happens when you eat refined sugar that will deplete you of
b b1 people that do more carbohydrates require more b1 diabetics with higher blood sugar require
a lot more b1 or they get a lot more damage to the eyes the kidneys the heart and the brain
vitamin d is a great thing to help lower your pulse rate and your blood pressure if you just had
a vitamin d deficiency that could be the reason why your pulse rate is high and the reason why
your blood pressure is high too and of course the last thing is keeping your stress as low as
possible easier said than done but i wanted to bring that up so anyway i just wanted to
give you some data on your resting pulse rate and definitely monitor it and do things to
keep it on the low side hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

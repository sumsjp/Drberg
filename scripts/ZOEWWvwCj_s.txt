i want to talk about vitiligo vitiligo that's how it's pronounced what is it
it's a deep pigmentation problem you're losing your pigment in certain areas of the body the
cells in control of adding pigments to the skin called melanocytes have stopped working correctly
now this condition is associated with autoimmune conditions so
a lot of times people with vitiligo have other autoimmune conditions but there's still
a lot of unknowns about whether it is an autoimmune condition or not what we do know
about vitiligo is there's a huge amount of free radical damage okay there's a lot of something
called ross it's creating oxidation free radical damage and hydrogen peroxide okay now it just so
happens that these two trace minerals zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful
antioxidant super oxide dismutase okay so zinc and copper are needed to make this antioxidant also if
a problem has a vitamin d receptor problem it's called a polymorphism for the vitamin d receptor
they are four times more at risk of getting vitiligo now one treatment they use for vitiligo
would be using certain light therapy and we do know there's an association with light or even
the sun and vitamin d and lastly there's a very interesting pilot study which i'm going
to put a link down below that showed that when a person took 35 000 ius of vitamin d3
there is significant improvements in this condition 14 out of 16 patients had a 25 to 75
percent re-pigmentation that's huge i did another video on vitiligo but i didn't talk
about the dosage recommended for these three supplements so this is what i would recommend
if you have this condition i would recommend taking a hundred milligrams of zinc per day
i would take 35 000 ius of vitamin d3 every single day and i would take 1500
micrograms not milligrams of copper every single day to support this enzyme
and also to help overcome any barriers of vitamin d absorption vitamin d acts like cortisol in the
body without the side effects and one of the treatments for vitiligo is to take prednisone or
cortisone cream why not take vitamin d instead and hopefully improve this condition without the side
effects and as a last note if you haven't seen my other videos on autoimmune conditions in general
because vitiligo is associated with autoimmune conditions i would highly recommend doing not
just intermittent fasting but periodic prolonged fasting this is essential to help your immune
system regenerate all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

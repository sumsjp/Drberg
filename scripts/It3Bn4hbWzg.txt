hello dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about dry burning eyes all right in other
videos I've talked about dry eyes being a vitamin A deficiency well there's other causes as well one
being high amounts of sugar okay like in diabetes or prediabetes or even insulin resistance now
if you want to look this up just look up ocular dryness so what happens in over 50% of diabetics
is when you get the symptom of dry eyes diabetics also experience retinopathy so it's a problem with
the retina cataracts glaucoma macular edema these are all issues with the eye so there's a huge
connection between high sugar and eye problems you can also have foreign body sensation which is this
the feeling with just something in the eye when there's nothing in the eye now I had this really
bad in my late 20s like two years ago I'm just kidding I'm 52 but the point is that it was so
bad I flew around the country to try to get help by all these guru doctors I went to even Bernard
Jenson I went to a seminar on a weekend I waited the whole weekend stood in line to ask him what
is this and I just went like that and I show the blood-red shot dried eyes and he looked at me he
said I don't know but little did I know it was actually insulin resistance as a pre-diabetic
situation okay so why why the connection what happens with high sugar well the glands stop
in the tear gland stops producing tears number two you get micro vascular damage that means very very
small vascular arterial damage to the nerve on the cornea and then the cornea is on the outer part of
the eye and it's innervated by nerves there's blood vessels that can keep the nerve alive so
what happens is high insulin disrupts the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea and
that affects the tears it dries up the eye it can it's ulcers irritation vision problems you name it
so that's really the mechanism make sense now what do you do about it very simple there's five things
now you've probably been watching my videos so you already know I'm going to say but if you have
never watched my videos you need to watch some of the videos because it's really five simple things
that you need to do number one cut the sugar out number two moderate amount of protein number three
seven cups of vegetables before higher amounts of fat and number five three meals no snacks and
then down to two meals it's called intermittent fasting now I know you've heard this over and
over and over but the more that I researched insulin resistance the more on finding it's
connected to more and more problems so the reason why I'm emphasizing it is it's so widespread that
if you were to focus on that you would get rid of the majority of your problems alright thanks for

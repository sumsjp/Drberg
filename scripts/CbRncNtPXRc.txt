hey guys dr. Berg here I have a question do you like food too much is do
you think about it all the time are you constantly seeking out junk food well
here's the point there's two types of people people that are eating for health
and people are eating for pleasure okay so I used to be over here in fact I
would just be obsessed with sugar in junk foods that's all I would think
about and I think most of that was a physical blood sugar issue if you have
cravings like I did it's almost impossible to eat for health I would go
to the grocery store buy some health food celery but buy the junk food but I
wouldn't eat the celery and it would go bad right so once you get rid of
cravings and I put a link down below of how to completely get rid of cravings it
allows you to step back and not have that body impulse so you can control
what's going on because some people waste so many people waste so much time
thinking about food and food is just material to help you nourish the body I
mean the purpose of food is to give you nourishment yes it could be pleasurable
but when you start letting food control you that's when it gets out of out of
hand okay so what we want to do is get you back in control over your own body
because you're in charge and not be at the effect of constantly having to go
off your program and eat the wrong foods all right
so watch that video down below get rid of your cravings and and post your
comments below I'll see you in the next video

so in this video i want to talk about the relationship between
zinc and your liver zinc is probably one of the most important
minerals for the liver and here's why when you look at the symptoms from a
zinc deficiency they're identical to the symptoms
of a liver problem and i'm talking about a liver that's dysfunctional like if
it's inflamed or there's scar tissue as in cirrhosis
when people have a liver problem they usually get loss of appetite the
loss of body hair altered taste and smell now it could be
because you're deficient in zinc testicular
atrophy your immune system is impaired you have
decreased ability to detoxify drugs from your body you can get ascites
you have this protruded stomach because the liver is leaking fluid
into a sac around the stomach a deficiency of zinc can increase your
risk for liver cancer inflammation in the liver
and a lot of skin problems the question is is it the chicken of the egg
does a zinc deficiency cause the liver to create these symptoms or is it the
liver damage that's creating these symptoms
as well as creating a zinc deficiency well that's very hard to tell because
we do know in an isolated situation the zinc deficiency for example
will create low testosterone and testicular atrophy
but if the liver is damaged you're not going to be able to get rid of estrogen
and you're going to get high levels of estrogen which is indirectly going to
cause a low testosterone situation what we do
know is all these symptoms right here could
be a zinc deficiency or it could be a
problem with your liver and by getting more zinc in your diet or
taking it in the supplement form you can reduce these symptoms right here
and even sometimes prevent them as well as protect the
liver if you're not familiar with what foods
are high in zinc shellfish is at the top of the list beef
liver beef in general lamb other meats
seeds nuts dairy products eggs there is zinc in whole wheat but
the problem is the bran in wheat products prevents the
absorption of zinc because it has something called
phytates so of course to get the zinc you want to avoid
all grains as well as sugar because when you consume
sugar you deplete zinc unfortunately a lot of people have a zinc deficiency and
they don't know it we don't retain zinc very well
if you're not consuming zinc from the diet chances are you're going to be
somewhat deficient and it's going to start on a gradient
and you may not even notice a full-blown deficiency until later because some of
the subclinical or subtle signs of a zinc
deficiency could be like fatigue and weakness and
lethargy that you may associate with something else
if you have any liver problem or any attention that you potentially could
have a liver problem make sure you have enough zinc in your
diet because that's very very important if not the most important mineral
to support a healthy liver

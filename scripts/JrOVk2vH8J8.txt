hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about popcorn okay now a lot
of people love popcorn in fact I love popcorn in fact I used to work at a theater in making
the popcorn that was last year no I'm just kidding it was like five thirty five years
ago but anyway 95% popcorn is GMO so that's one of the problems with popcorn popcorn is
highly glycemic it turns into sugar pretty fast it's not good if you want to lose weight but
the microwave popcorn is the worst because it has a chemical in the butter flavoring called
diacetyl and it's been linked to a lot of bad problems so I'll put a link down below so you
want to avoid microwaved popcorn okay now some of you are very very upset that I'm talking
about these things and you you're not going to give up popcorn so for those of you that
want to do popcorn on a infrequent basis I want to give you an alternative especially if you're
not trying to lose weight you know just don't do this it's frequent as maybe you were doing
the regular popcorn but you can take another grain called sorghum okay you can get this
anywhere you get online and you can pop it just like popcorn sorghum is gluten-free non-gmo it
has the lowest glycemic index of all the grains okay but you can just compete yourself cook it
in coconut oil and use grass-fed butter okay in sea salt the butter will buffer some of the
glycemic index but it's a lot better than corn as far as turning in the sugar so that's just a
quick tip but again I'm not telling everyone can start consuming a lot of popcorn because
I'm going to get some emails saying them now I'm not losing weight because I'm eating this
every single day it's just your alternative every so often alright thanks for watching

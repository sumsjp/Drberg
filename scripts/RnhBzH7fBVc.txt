let's talk about the nine most common
low carb myths okay
you hear this all the time and i just
want to cover each one of them the first
one is that low carb diets
are a fad
okay now a fad is some intense and
widely shared enthusiasm for something
that is short-lived so the question is
why would it be short-lived if you're
benefiting on a low-carb diet
you're going to stick with it why would
you stop it
and
why is it so bad to be enthusiastic
about something that works
yes there are a lot of people that are
intensely enthusiastic about
keto and low carb diets and imminent
fasting because they feel so much better
so the low carb diets are absolutely
positively not a fad
some people would want you to believe
that but it's absolutely growing and
growing growing it's not going to be
short-lived simply because it works
next one it's okay for weight loss but
not for long-term health
now this is completely
ridiculous why would something work
short term and not work in the long run
now the argument that certain people
will use
is that they'll take the evidence of or
the studies of traditional or classical
keto
for epilepsy where they have low quality
ingredients you have all these different
side effects like kidney stones and gout
and high cholesterol and bad breath
well we're not recommending
that version we are recommending the
healthy low carb or keto version of the
ketogenic diet all right next one number
three all that fat is going to make you
get a heart attack
absolutely positively not true first of
all
um i never met anyone that is consuming
all the bacon grease from the bacon they
fry up the bacon and they toss out the
grease and they leave the crispy bacon
okay
most people don't eat a lot of butter
okay on one sitting now what's
interesting about butter is i used to
crave butter as a child
i didn't know that i needed a lot of
butter for the vitamin k2
and i was very very deficient in fact i
remember wanting to consume a whole
pound of butter so my parents wouldn't
do that because they at the time had
this idea that fat was bad
but if you crave butter you probably
need something in the butter but the
point is that we're recommending healthy
fats fats that normally come with
protein and no fat is not unhealthy
especially if you're not adding
the carbohydrates
to the fat
so when you add the carbohydrates to the
fat that becomes a problem but we're
doing low carbohydrates okay
all right number four it's not
sustainable
this is hilarious
low carb diets get rid of your cravings
low carb diets
make you so you're not hungry anymore
guess what that's very sustainable when
you start adding in the carbs and the
frequent eating
and even a low calorie diet
that's not sustainable but keto and low
carb is very sustainable number five
it's not healthy to omit a food group
well first of all that is completely
made up by the food manufacturing
companies that sell certain foods that
really shouldn't be in our diet in the
first place there's no such thing as
essential
sugar okay or essential refined
carbohydrates
so it's extremely healthy to omit
certain food groups all right number six
you don't want to cut your carbs because
you're going to be cutting down your
vegetables well whoever said that
doesn't understand that we don't
count
vegetables in our equation we want you
to consume lots of vegetables as in
seven to ten cups
per day so that's what we want and we're
not cutting down on vegetables and you
can also have some berries
number seven your brain needs carbs if
you don't have carbs you're going to be
tired now whoever's telling you that is
a compl
you know what
i'm not going to go there
your brain can very easily run on
ketones it loves ketones
the carbohydrates
are the things that destroy the brain
and cause alzheimer's okay when you
reduce carbs your bo your body
automatically starts making ketones and
your brain thrives on ketones you'll
have better mental endurance
it helps your cognitive function if
there's damage in the brain
ketones will bypass that mechanism and
feed the brain cells directly i'm really
talking about those people who are
telling you that your brain needs carbs
they have usually have brain damage
because they've been consuming too many
carbohydrates a low carb diet is not
good for a diabetic because the
rationale is you're going to end up with
low blood sugar hypoglycemia
that is
complete and utter
insanity think about what diabetes is
it's a condition
of high sugar right
so
we're trying to lower it guess what's
going to happen when you go into low
carb your blood sugar is going to come
down
it's going to decrease the need for
medication okay you work with your
doctor you take less medication guess
what
now
less medication your blood sugar
goes normal
okay it's not going to go hypo it's
gonna go normal and you're gonna feel
much better
and number nine a low carb diet is
really a high protein diet and that's
damaging for the kidneys again
absolutely not true
a low carb diet as in healthy keto is
moderate amount of protein
three to six ounces maybe a little bit
more but it's not unlimited protein all
right there you have it the nine
low-carb myths and now i want you to
check out the myths of intermittent
fasting it's right on this page right

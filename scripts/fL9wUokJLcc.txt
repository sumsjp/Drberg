if you're drinking a lot of tea you should be taking vitamin b1 now i'm not necessarily
talking about herb teas i'm talking about black tea like earl grey tea english breakfast tea
english afternoon tea and irish breakfast tea and there's quite a few others as well but the
question is why does t deplete you of b1 because black tea has large amounts of tannins okay
that's a chemical that inhibits the absorption of b1 and as a side note uh green tea is
actually low in tannins so that's totally fine but black tea is the one you have to
watch out for because if you're consuming a lot of this tea through the day you can end
up with a b1 deficiency the first symptom of a b1 deficiency is nervous energy you may feel
tense you can't relax kind of edgy and all you need to do is just take some b1 i would highly
recommend getting your b1 from nutritional yeast or some other natural source not a synthetic
b1 now other things can also deplete you of thymine or b1 that would be red wine grapes
coffee sulphites which actually is in dry fruit and wine and it's used as a preservative consuming
fruit that's not ripe yet caffeine alcohol and sugar all will deplete you of vitamin b1
now probably out of all these factors sugar is probably at the top the list as far as depleting
you of vitamin b1 and as an extra point about this caffeine also has the ability to inhibit vitamin d
and iron all right so i just wanted to get right to the point give you this data
and give you a solution hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would

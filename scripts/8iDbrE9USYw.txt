let's talk about the difference between normal hair loss versus pathological hair loss okay
now you have hundreds of thousands of hairs growing on your head at any one given time and
the life cycle of a hair is between two and five years in a normal situation an average
person will lose between 50 to 100 strands of hair every single day so the way that you
would figure this out is you just rub your fingers through your hair with a gentle tug
and you should see anywhere between one and ten hairs in your hand and that is
normal but if you keep doing the same spot over and over and it keeps coming out
there's several reasons for this the biggest reason is there's some type of hormonal change
going on let's say you just gave birth or you are going through menopause this means that
your estrogen is high and your progesterone is low also if you have high levels of a hormone called
dht which is a powerful form of testosterone that can cause hair loss and that condition is called
alopecia and then if your thyroid is low that can also cause hair loss most hypothyroid conditions
are autoimmune and that would be hashimoto's and so that's not really a true thyroid problem it's
an immune problem i put some links down below for more information on that topic now if your
cortisol is too high because your stress is too high that can also cause hair loss also you can
lose your hair with certain medications especially birth control pills which again is the added
estrogen anti-depression medication as well as anti-anxiety medication can also cause hair loss
as well as taking insulin if you're diabetic that can lead to hair loss now if you have an
autoimmune condition called lupus that's one cause and another big cause of hair
loss is nutrient deficiencies so if you're low in vitamin d b12 vitamin c vitamin a
especially zinc which is very common low in biotin which normally comes because
there's some problem in your gut let's say you've got antibiotics for example then that's going to
kill off the microbes that actually make biotin and that can lead to hair loss i have a video
on that i list it down below and also if you're low on selenium which is a mineral that helps
you convert t4 to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone so low selenium can cause a
conversion problem with your thyroid and that can lead to hair loss if you have not seen some of my
other videos on hair loss i've done quite a few i listed them down below check them out hey before

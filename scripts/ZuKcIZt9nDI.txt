if you had the pick between a stroke or a heart attack which one would you rather have now of
course you wouldn't want either but if you had to pick one which one would you rather have but go
ahead and tell me in the comments down below i'm very curious a stroke is basically either a clot
or plaquing that has dislodged somewhere in your body either in the carotid arteries through here
or the heart and it's gone up into your brain and it's stopping blood flow now the heart attack we
have a clot or a plaque that's stopping blood flow in the heart muscle so in reality a stroke
and a heart attack is really the exact same thing but in different locations in the body now for me
i would much rather have a heart attack than a stroke because having half of your body being
paralyzed and then having your spouse drag you around clean you bathe you take you everywhere
oh my gosh that would be such a burden on your spouse and to be trapped in a body where half of
your body is non-functional would be literally torture now with a heart attack which has a 12
mortality versus a stroke which has a 28 mortality we have become really good at keeping people alive
so when people have a heart attack there's really great emergency care that can recover a person
but the number one cause of death is a heart attack and with a stroke that's the fifth cause
of death now they use this acronym for a stroke so f would be your face is drooping on one side
you're losing muscle control and a would stand for your arm on one side being weak or even paralyzed
and then we have s for speech difficulty you're splurring you can't really articulate as well
and then you have tea for time there's no time for waste
if someone has a stroke you want to call 9-1-1 get them into the hospital so they can quickly
give you a certain medication to dissolve the clot usually you have up to six hours but the
sooner the better now what's really bizarre about a heart attack is 48
of the us population has a heart problem and many times they don't even know it all right
so you can get all these tests done and you can get your arteries scoped and you should
you should get a test called the cac it stands for coronary artery calcification test or skin
it's a quick test to measure how much calcium is in the artery and it's one of the best predictors
of heart attacks and obviously if there's calcium there's plaquing and some of that plaque can
get dislodged and travel up to your brain but the underlying mechanism the root cause for both
of these problems is exactly the same because they both originate in the heart well sometimes
a stroke can originate from problems in your carotid arteries through your in your neck through
here but most of the time it actually comes from your heart you have this piece of plaque that
dislodges from the heart goes up to the brain so the mechanism is this you have inflammation in the
inside of your arteries which is then creating a compensatory or compensating reaction where your
body is going to try to heal with a band-aid the body's band-aid is calcium cholesterol
and certain proteins like fibrous tissue and that inflammation if you've been watching my videos
is either coming from the over consumption of the bad carbs refined carbohydrates and sugar
or too many omega-6 fatty acids which is in pretty much all the foods like the soy oil the corn oil
the canola oil which is the majority of your salad dressing and deep fried foods and the list goes on
and on and on and of course we switched over to these omega-6 fatty acids because we thought that
saturated fats were bad for you when in fact they are not bad for you as long as you keep your carbs
low now let's say for example you don't want to go get a test and you want other clues
to know if you have inflammation in your arteries number one just do this right now
stand up and look down at your toes if you happen to see something obstructing your view
called your belly okay your belly sticking out chances are you have inflammation in your arteries
because belly fat is a symptom of too much insulin and too much blood glucose and both
of those are like steel wool or sandpaper for the inside of your arteries number two
look in the mirror at your face do you have a swollen face look around the eyes are they puffy
are your cheeks puffy do you have fat in your neck it's a really good indication that you
have too much insulin too much blood glucose and that means that your arteries are also inflamed
all right number three are you a carbo junkie do you crave carbs do you eat chips late at night do
you always have to have a dessert do you always have the fries when you order a hamburger do you
basically do carbs if you do chances are you have inflammation in the arteries now there are three
things i'm going to recommend number one i'm going to recommend you get some vitamin e immediately
the type of vitamin e you need to get is called tocatrinos okay take about 300 milligrams every
single day and that's going to help reduce the oxidation or the free radicals that's going on
in the inside of your arteries vitamin e is the absolute best nutrient for the heart number two
you want to lower your carbs okay that's called the ketogenic plan and number three and this is
actually just as important as number two you want to do intermittent fasting you want to stop the
snacking you want to skip your breakfast because that will instantly lower the amount of insulin
that's being pumped through your body which i bet anything you've never had that tested there's a
great test to do it's called homa ir and they usually are focused on the blood sugars but they
don't check the fasting insulin which is usually high way before you have high blood glucose
in fact it's the thing in the background that's pushing your blood sugars down so when you get
your blood sugars checked they appear to be normal which in fact the only reason that
they're normal is because the insulin is so high pushing your blood sugar down so anyway comment
down below and tell me which condition you would rather have if you're forced to have either so if

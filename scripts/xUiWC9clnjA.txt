let's talk about epilepsy in the ketogenic diet in 1923 dr russell wilder or it could be wilder i'm
not sure was working in the mayo clinic and he observed or read about people in history
not having seizures when they fasted so he was curious about that he wanted to find a way that
he could mimic fasting because eventually a person is going to have to eat and when they start eating
the seizures could come back so what he found is when you put someone on a low carb diet
you can actually reduce their seizures by 50 percent okay which is pretty significant and 15
of that group completely got rid of their seizures 100 percent so that began the classic keto
diet for epilepsy and it's definitely evolved into various ratios of fat to protein and carb
so you could do a four to one ratio where you have four times as much fat to protein and carb
or three to one or two to one or even one to one now the more ratio of fat to protein and carb
the more you're going to get into ketosis and the less ratio the less you're going to
get into ketosis and so one of the reasons why they have different ratios is because as you
lessen the fat increasing protein and carb it makes it easier for the patient there's
better compliance and they also use the modified atkins diet which you're not calorie counting
you're not being that strict when you go to a restaurant and it allows for more protein
you're not measuring anything it just makes it a little bit easier now they're not actually
sure why the ketogenic diet works for seizures but there is some theories one is that it improves the
stability of your synapses between your neurons number two ketones have anti-convulsant effects
number three it decreases brain inflammation it could be a combination of all three of these
things i do know that the brain prefers ketones over glucose because it runs more efficiently
now some of the problems that a patient could experience going on this diet is that they can
develop a lot of constipation issues some pretty severe keto fatigue bad breath higher cholesterol
kidney stones which is actually not that common but it potentially can occur now my opinion on
why those side effects occur is that the classic keto doesn't necessarily focus on the quality
of ingredients okay and so they're mainly focused on the macros they have a powdered drink that is
literally you know soy oil maltodextrin casein to me that is definitely not healthy and if someone
were to consume that it might taste okay but to put that in your body you might notice quite a
few side effects and they generally recommend like synthetic vitamins and things like that
what i would recommend if someone has epilepsy and they're going to do keto and they want to do
the classic keto diet or any of these right here i would highly recommend tweaking the ingredients to
make them healthier i would definitely shoot for like organic grass-fed wild caught pasture-raised
eggs things like that but there's some other things that i would recommend too i would highly
recommend that they add intermittent fasting because currently they don't and so instead of
three meals a day i would do minimally two meals a day now if there's a small child that could be
a problem and you might have to have larger meals but the fact that you're adding fasting
with this ketogenic plan but i think that's going to take your results to a whole new level i would
also avoid vegetable oils because if you look at the classic ketogenic diet they're allowing
soy oil corn oil which is inflammatory so it's going to create digestive issues eventually and it
could majorly inhibit your results the other thing i would recommend is i would majorly increase the
amount of greens like green salads now the thing that you have to realize that the carbs from salad
are very very small the calories from salad are almost insignificant there's so much
fiber and there's so little sugar that that would be perfect on the classic ketogenic plan and even
probably work within this four to one ratio right here and of course i would definitely recommend
the olive oil being the best oil even in larger amounts versus any other oil that you would get
on salad dressing that's pretty low level now the salad and the vegetables are going to offset
the acidity from the ketones because if you're doing four to one you're eating fat you're going
to majorly induce a state of ketosis and so the lower the carbs the lower the protein the higher
the fat the more the ketones but you're going to also get a lot of acidity so you're going to
need to offset that with vegetables and salad so i would recommend doing a good portion that will not
throw you out of ketosis and i think it would would really solve a lot of the complications
especially even the mineral problem that people have because when you actually start ketosis you
lose a lot of water and you lose electrolytes so you'd want to add in electrolytes for sure
potassium citrate which will counter any potential risk for kidney stones and then the electrolytes
would give you the magnesium and so would the salad as well and don't forget sea salt one
to one and a half teaspoons a day now if you're doing this diet for a small child maybe you
do less than one teaspoon but the sea salt is important a good high quality sea salt himalayan
sea salt is good or some other red salts that will help because what's going to happen is as you
induce ketosis you're going to lose a lot of fluid and with that comes a loss of sodium and that can
actually even make the person feel fatigued right off the bat so this is a real simple
alternative to solve that problem number four if you're doing a lot of fats especially this
ratio right here i would recommend adding in purified bile salts to handle some of that
fat it's going to help you digest it you're going to lessen the side effect of nausea and bloating
and even high cholesterol because bile which is produced by the liver stored in the gallbladder
helps to regulate cholesterol it helps to break down fats so if you're doing that much fat it
might really help to do this right here number four instead of synthetic vitamins do a whole food
brand vitamin something that's higher quality not the synthetic ones i already mentioned the
electrolytes as well as the sea salt now for those of you that have epilepsy or you have a child that
has epilepsy and you want a healthier version of the classic keto i put a link down below
so you can download some examples of some good meals that you can use to help get you in ketosis
but to do it in a healthy way hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what
about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

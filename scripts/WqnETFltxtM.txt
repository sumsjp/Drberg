hey guys dr. Berg here this video is for wrestlers only okay I'm gonna talk
about how to cut weight very fast but do it in a healthy way I was a wrestler in
high school and college and I'm the example of how not to do it I would eat
the wrong foods I would start off undefeated in the beginning the season
and then end up being so weak I was always cutting weight starving my body
and you can really screw up your metabolism big-time so let's talk about
how to do it healthily the biggest danger in losing weight especially
before a meet you have to weigh in you have to lose like 5 to 7 to 10 pounds in
like a day or two what happens is you're only gonna lose fluids okay that's it
and the problem with losing fluid is all the electrolytes that come with it so
you end up with the severe potassium deficiency what that's gonna do is going
to put your heart at risk for a heart attack there have been many wrestlers
that have died of heart attacks when you combine a heat work working out you know
the sauna losing a lot of weight losing a lot of fluid and then a heart attack
okay so you don't want to do that so when you're losing weight and you're
working out the day before a match get an electrolyte powder that doesn't have
any sugar in it okay and I'll tell you why in a second so you want a lot of
potassium you want at least a thousand milligrams of potassium per serving size
because here's the thing potassium is one of the most important minerals for
the heart for energy okay to keep your energy high and we need about 4700
milligrams every single day but you might say well I eat bananas right well
banana is 300 milligrams you need 4700 that's like 7 to 10 cups of vegetables
no one does that most people eat all this protein and they have no vegetables
so we need the vegetables for your strength and for your potassium and for
the other minerals very very important if I had to go back in time I would have
had these big salads it would have been incredible I would have maintained way
better energy so that's number one consume more salads you want to start
cutting out the carbohydrates okay because that's the thing not the fat the
carbs that's what keeps you from being really really lean if you need to lose
weight or cut weight the thing that you need to cut is the carbs that would be
any hidden sugar let me explain juice orange juice
alcohol bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes muffins those
have to go I would even avoid fruit okay maybe a
little bit of berry let's say you wanted to get your salad in a you get some kale
get it from the grocery store freeze it put about a cup of berries fill up with
water blend it up you can actually drink your 10 cups or 7 cups of vegetables
right there before an evening and so when you wake up you're just like all
recharged with potassium so that way you can get the least amount of carbs from
the like a little bit of berry but you're not doing like fruit or bananas
things like that now as far as protein goes I don't recommend protein powders
because if you have too much protein powder it's really hard on the liver and
it does spike the hormone that keeps you from losing weight which is insulin if
you have too much I'd rather you do actual meats chicken fish beef things
like that if you're doing a hamburger do without the bun hotdog without the bun
try to go grass-fed but you need about 8 ounces of protein with each meal I like
to do eggs too like 4 eggs would be great don't do just the the whites do
the whole egg because the the next part is you need fat why because without the
fat you put a lot of stress on the organs and we need all the essential
like vitamin A vitamin D those aren't that comes from fat so I would recommend
avocados I would do peanut butter actual butter and definitely cod liver oil and
that way you get the nutrients from the bat soluble nutrients from the fat and
also one of the things if you were gonna do a meal and not be hungry in between
the meal adding fat is going to be the best thing to consume because we want to
do a version if you want to cut weight you don't want to do six small meals a
day you want to do three meals a day and maybe if you really need
to cut more do two meals a day but I think he's gonna do three if you're
working out that much but just make sure you don't snack in between that's called
in a minute fasting you will lose way more weight doing three big meals than
five small meals because every time you eat you spike insulin so how do you go
from one meal to the next by adding more fat you're gonna feel very satisfied so
peanut butter nuts avocado things like that and I'll put a
link down below there's also these called keto bombs that you can make
their little cookies with fat but you can have and you'll be able to be very
satisfied so you're not hungry between the meals but your body will actually
start burning it's called ketones and it's more efficient it's burning fat and
it's a much better fuel source for athletes you'll have more endurance and
you'll have the unfair advantage to your opponent because they don't know about
this so I would highly recommend it the other thing the other nutrient that you
need to get is the B vitamins but you don't want to get the synthetic version
you want to go to health the store and get what's called nutritional yeast that
has all the B vitamins take a couple tablespoons maybe even four mix it with
water drink it down because the B vitamins will give you a lot of energy
as well okay so then we have talked about three meals and the last thing I
would recommend is do and not over a train the biggest mistake I made was
working out twice I would work out during practice and then work out at
night when I got home at nine o'clock big mistake I never recovered so it
would break down my muscles and I would never recover so only work out once try
to take the weekends off and not train on the weekends so your body can recover
all the benefit from your workouts occur in the recovery phase when you're not
working out or when you're sleeping and it's it's very important to sleep more
as well so we got electrolytes make sure you have that make sure you do when
you're drinking fluids put that in all your fluid it's because so that way you
have the potassium cut the carbs three meals 8 ounce of protein with each meal
huge huge salads or you do the calcic a healthy fats avocado collard oil egg
yolks nutritional yeast and don't overtrain
so these are the things of the most important go ahead and do it and put

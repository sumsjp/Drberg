what emotion triggers adrenaline can you guess
fear fear triggers adrenaline so does exercise excitement
physical threat and hypoglycemia low blood sugar can all trigger adrenaline now let's
take a look at what adrenaline does it increases your heart rate sweating vasodilation of both the
lung tissue so you can breathe better as well as the heart the coronary artery vasodilates
when there's adrenaline getting more oxygen and blood to the heart muscle tissue this is one of
the reasons why you probably have seen movies where they've injected someone into the heart
with adrenaline to revive them adrenaline makes your body stronger more alert because it's part
of the flight or fight mechanism you're being chased by a tiger right it releases glucose from
your liver and your muscles for quick energy and it triggers this other hormone right here
which relates to something called the hpa axis the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal axis
this is a little different mechanism where you're increasing cortisol which is the other
stress hormone so both adrenaline and cortisol are preparing the body for a stress state
the difference is adrenaline is is what within seconds cortisol takes a few minutes to kick in
cortisol is more long-lasting adrenaline is more short-lived now i'll never forget when
i was in wrestling i wrestled in 9th grade 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade in the first year
of college until i fractured my neck but in high school i wrestled at 185 pounds
which by the way that's actually my weight right now but there's only one more weight
class above this which is heavyweight so when we had a meet i would literally have to wait for
all these wrestlers to wrestle before it was my opportunity and so there was a lot of excitement
there was a lot of fear going on i remember trying to relax and rest underneath the bleachers before
the match because i literally had to wait probably i don't know an hour and a half before i wrestled
and so i was laying there and i felt my heart rate beating through my chest just boom boom boom boom
i was sweating i had a lot of energy flowing through my body so i was not about to take a nap
i was not about to feel calm i was basically in an adrenaline mode for about an hour and a half
and so what happened that drained my energy so by the time i was ready to wrestle i was
completely exhausted but somehow i pushed through it so short-term adrenaline is good
chronic exposure to too much adrenaline is very very bad because it burns you out it can burn out
the adrenals it can affect the heart it can affect your mood you can actually have a lower tolerance
for stress it can actually prevent you from going into a relaxing sleep if there's a little too much
adrenaline flowing through your body here's the thing with adrenaline adrenaline is made by the
inside of your adrenals called the adrenal medulla and this adrenaline which is a neurotransmitter
it's like a hormone but it travels through the nervous system is part of the sympathetic nervous
system it's kind of like the on switch to stress the off switch which is called the parasympathetic
is not in the adrenals so the unique thing about the adrenals it's 100% sympathetic nervous system
and there's no parasympathetic innervation in the inside of the adrenal in other words there's no
off switch and so if you chronically stimulate the adrenals with any of these over a period of time
the adrenals tend to stay on and they don't turn off that well and so here you are you can't sleep
you can't relax you feel stress all the time and then that's going to activate more cortisol and
then you get belly fat so the question is what can you do about it this is really not a nutritional
problem this is a stress problem so you need to disconnect from the stress or somehow handle the
stress whatever that stress is if it's certain groups of people or a person you need to handle
that that includes turning off the tv so you're not watching the news every night changing your
environment sleeping more there's some really good important nutritional things you can do to help
but without handling this right here these really won't create a big impact but vitamin b1 is at the
top of the list if you take b1 or nutritional yeast you're going to feel a sense of relief
vitamin d vitally important and vitamin c because your adrenals need vitamin c
both adrenaline and cortisol without vitamin c your adrenal glands do not work but let me come
back to this little point right here hypoglycemia and what causes hypoglycemia what has the capacity
to push your blood sugars down and the answer to that is insulin and what triggers that you
guessed it a high carbohydrate diet being on a high carbohydrate diet keeps your body in flight
or fight mode activating adrenaline and creating a situation where it's going to be really hard
to lose weight so just by changing your diet going on a low carb diet guess what can happen you can
help to restore normal levels of adrenaline and this is why when people do the keto diet
they feel calmer they feel less stressed if you're new to my channel i put a link down below
of exactly what you should be eating hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how
to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate

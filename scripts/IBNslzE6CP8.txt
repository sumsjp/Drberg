so recently i was doing some research on the drugs that deplete
vitamin d i just found some interesting things i want to share with you
um corticosteroids like prednisone normally are used as an
anti-inflammatory right well here's the thing vitamin d is one
of the best anti-inflammatories problem is when you take cortical
steroids you're depleting your vitamin d creating more inflammation and need for
more corticosteroids number two antibiotics
certain antibiotics block your absorption of vitamin
d and vitamin d is needed to strengthen the junctions of the cells in your colon
so without vitamin d you create leaky gut
so when you take antibiotics block vitamin d
and now we're not going to protect the integrity of the
gut barrier increasing our chance of getting autoimmune diseases
and allergies and things like that now when someone takes an antibiotic for
tb for example that creates a vitamin d deficiency but
one of the common treatments that they used for
tb before they had antibiotics was cod liver oil and sunshine vitamin d
because they found that it actually helped this condition and all those
antibiotics that are taken for bronchial infections and respiratory infections
which then block vitamin d increase your susceptibility of getting another
infection in the bronchial area because you're low in vitamin d so you
have a lot of vitamin d receptors in the upper and lower respiratory areas
in your sinuses and your lungs and they're there because of the
extensive immune protection and the very reason why you even get an
infection and you need antibiotics is because you're vitamin d
deficient now antidepressants block vitamin d one of the most
therapeutic things for vitamin d is to help you with depression
so here you are taking a drug for depression or anxiety
and it's creating a vitamin d deficiency thereby making you dependent on that
drug as soon as you try to get off of it you
you can't all right number four phenol barbitol
this is used as an anti-anxiety and for seizures
well guess what vitamin d does it helps reduce stress
it helps anxiety and it decreases the risk of
seizures so again here's the medication blocks your
vitamin d create a vitamin d deficiency and now we make it worse okay dilatin is
also used for seizures same thing it blocks vitamin d all right
number six cholesteroamine this is a medication
that blocks bile if someone has too much bile and
it also blocks cholesterol so cholesterol
is needed to make bile and vitamin d and this medication definitely blocks
the ability to make vitamin d so you're going to be vitamin d
deficient if you're on this medication number seven we have ulcer medications a
big cause of ulcers is the microbe h pylori there's some
great research that showed that vitamin d produced a
77.2 eradication of h pylori which is going to help the
person's ulcer so i just found it interesting that the
reason you would need these medications in the first place
is your vitamin d deficient the problem is when you take them
you create a vitamin d deficiency so it's totally logical
so if you have any symptoms you may want to try taking some vitamin d

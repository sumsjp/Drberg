now i've been getting quite a few questions related to kidney stones so i wanted to give
you some additional information that might be helpful if you are a stone former now if you've
never had a kidney stone or not concerned about it you probably are not going to be interested
in this video but for those people who have a kidney stone right now or had a kidney stone
this information is very valuable but there's some really great data which i'm going to put
some links down below that shows that a vitamin a deficiency can greatly increase your risk of
getting a bladder stone and a kidney stone and in the study that i reference taking vitamin a can
decrease your risk of bladder stones and kidney stones but i want to talk about why that might
work now primarily i'm talking about the calcium oxalate stone which is the most common
kidney stone so here's the data when you are deficient in vitamin a several things can occur
number one you can have a low amount of creatinine and at this point the only thing you need to know
about that is that it's a protein in the urine that could come from the breakdown of muscle but
that's a whole different topic number two lower amounts of something called glycoaminoglycans now
what the heck is that well glyco comes from the word sugar amino amino acid or protein so
it's this compound between a sugar and a protein and apparently that compound is one of the most
potent inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystals developing in your kidney which is interesting
and this occurs when you're deficient in vitamin a
number three lower amounts of phosphates number four higher amounts of calcium accumulating in the
kidney number five higher amounts of oxalates in the kidney number six higher amounts of uric acid
in the kidney so now you can see there's a huge connection between not having enough vitamin a
and developing all these factors that could lead to a kidney stone now another point about this
is that chondroitin sulfate is a type of a glycoaminoglycan and there's a good amount
of research that demonstrates that chondroitin sulfate can reduce your risk of kidney stones
and now we know why so in summary if you want to decrease the risk of kidney stones
it might be a really good idea to start taking vitamin a now i'm not talking about the vitamin
a and vegetables that's a precursor i'm talking about taking the active form of vitamin a called
retinol one of the best sources would be the cod liver oil you can also get it from beef kidney
and of course if you're going to try to find a beef kidney supplement make sure it's grass-fed
but i would also recommend in addition to taking vitamin a take chondroitin sulfate since
that might give you the edge that you need to really prevent kidney stones thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

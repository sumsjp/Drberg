hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the cruciferous detox effect okay
so just check this out see this book right here this is called toxicology what in toxicology is
the study of poisons look at how sick this thing is okay let me show you something so
this is called the basic science of poisons these are all the different chemicals that a person is
exposed to pesticides herbicides and it shows you the the effects it has on the body the disease's
it creates where it gets acute its cumulated in the kidney or the liver or the respiratory tract
or the skin okay so this is interesting it says that most chemicals that produce systemic toxicity
do not cause a similar degree of toxicity in all organs instead they usually elicit their
major toxicity in only one or two organs the target organ of toxicity is often not the site
of the highest concentration of the chemical for example lead is concentrated in the bone DDT is
concentrated in adipose tissue interesting so now check this out biotransformation of the
antibiotics what does that mean it's a fancy term for the elimination of chemicals on the
body so your body has the ability through the liver into the enzymes to get rid of poisons
okay and the unique thing that you need to know about is that these poisons are fat soluble now
they're not water soluble so they get stuck in the fat cell and that is the obstacle to their
elimination because LeBeau trophic which means chemicals that get stuck in the lipids or fats the
trophic compounds can be easy readily reabsorbed consequently the elimination of xenobiotics as
chemicals often depends on their conversion to water-soluble chemicals by a process known as bio
transformation so our body basically has enzymes to break down fat soluble chemicals into water
seidel chemicals and this happens in the liver so check out this next part you got a liver right
livers on the right side the liver has the ability to detoxify can calls and everyday we're exposed
to pesticides herbicides chemicals GMO foods don't get me started on that one and the enzymes in the
liver basically go from phase 1 to phase 2 and they work together to take these really dangerous
poisons and turn them into harmless water soluble particles so that's what your liver does but the
problem is chronic exposure to these chemicals causes the speeding up of phase 1 okay what
happens when you when you don't balance these and this goes too much phase 2 gets overwhelmed and
you get a backup of toxins throughout the body so you cannot you no longer can detoxify you actually
get sick and this these toxins can spill off into the thyroid into the uterus into the grass cause
cancer so if these were working together you can actually kind of get rid of a lot of poisons that
you're exposed to so what cruciferous vegetables will do they enhance this process what they'll do
they actually inhibit phase one so they will slow down an overactive phase once and speed up a Phase
two to allow this process not to be overwhelmed but to speed up the elimination of these chemicals
now like I said before a lot of these chemicals that people are exposed to have a delayed effect
for 20 30 40 years so what affected you way back you know when your kid is now starting to affect
you now and that's why it's hard to connect the cause and effect relationship and that's
why it's so important to consume kale arugula bok choy Brussels sprouts cabbage cauliflower
collard greens radish on a regular basis so I suggest that you start consuming these if you
want a more convenient way to get all of these I have two things one is the cruciferous some of
you are already using this this has a blend of all the cruciferous in an organic form and the
other form is a new product that I have called estrogen balance I like this one a little bit
more if you're female because it has an additional thing called dim now what is dim well two capsules
of dim two capsules of this is equal to 2 pounds of cruciferous so dim is a highly concentrated
cruciferous phytochemical that allows this process to happen a lot quicker okay and you
would start out taking one of these per day and you would get used to it then you would add two
you would need to go past two but anything that you have an estrogen dominance because all these
chemicals mimic estrogen in the environment so you're talking like if you have heavy periods
fibrocystic breast fibroids cystic acne painful long periods menopause symptoms hot flashes night
sweats this is really good to balance the estrogen so it gets rid of the bad estrogen it improves as
a good estrogen it's not going to take all that jujin out of your body is just going to convert it
into the right level and help this detoxification process as well so it has properties it has
vitamin E it has kale it has cabbage a lot of cruciferous but it also has the dim tumeric and
a couple other things to support the adrenals so it's like it's an upgraded version of my ovarian
formula but with a lot of enhancements okay so if you're interested in either one of these you can
click the link below and start checking it out get some more information but anyway I wanted
to thank you for watching this I hope you learn something new and I will see you in the next video

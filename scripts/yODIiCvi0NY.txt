so recently i ate some sardines and i was sitting down there and i was looking at the
label and i happened to notice that they put soy oil they were using soy oil and i assumed
it was olive oil obviously when i bought it i didn't check the label and so it just prompted
this video because you never want to buy sardines in soy oil you want to get it either in water or
in olive oil the question is why would you want to do that because you have these incredible omega-3
fatty acids right and now you're going to nullify them by adding the omega-6 fatty acids in there
so the benefits of omega-3 are huge i mean you have anti-inflammatory it supports the brain it's
great for the heart and omega-6 fatty acids are the complete opposite especially when you get into
soy oil now soy oil is america's number one oil in other words it's the most popular oil used in our
food supply and it's second in the entire world so we're consuming a tremendous amount of soy oil
it's in fast food it's in most of the restaurants out there if you're getting anything fried
it's in animal feeds some interesting studies i'll put some links down below
one is by the journal of endocrinology the other is by uc riverside research team in 2015.
and this is what they showed they showed that soy oil induced obesity and diabetes more than
fructose it also induced insulin resistance and a fatty liver now to be totally transparent this
was done in rats okay not humans so if you have a pet rat that's getting a little bit too fat you
know becoming obese that's developing diabetes developing insulin resistance or a fatty liver
make sure you do not feed them soy oil now the study further went on to talk about the effects
on the hypothalamus it actually lowered oxytocin which is a hormone both in men
and women and so they found it affected over a hundred genes in your brain now soy oil because
it's been processed so badly is a very powerful oxidizer it's very estrogenic it creates a lot
of inflammation especially in your arteries and on top of everything else it's gmo which means it has
traces of glyphosate which is an herbicide and i've done a lot of videos on that topic so the
summary of this video is that if you buy sardines read the label and make sure it's either in water
or olive oil hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

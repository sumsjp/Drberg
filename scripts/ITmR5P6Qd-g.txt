you know every so often i'll hear people that say you know i don't eat sugar very often
maybe just on the weekends but it's it's not very frequent well this video is for that individual i
found a interesting uh research paper from the university of alberta canada where they tested
a short-term increase in sugar consumption and they found some interesting things that
happened the big thing is there was a significant increase in the risk of inflammatory bowel disease
so basically sugar creates more inflammation but why would it create inflammation in the gut well
your good bacteria prefer fiber as their fuel and fiber is a carbohydrate but it just is not
affected by insulin and the bad bacteria prefers sugar this is why when you consume a lot of
sugar you're going to get a yeast infection and then you stop eating sugar and the yeast or the
candida infection goes away and so when you're feeding these pathogens you're going to trigger
all sorts of immune reactions within your own body because now the good bacteria is fighting the bad
bacteria and you have this inflammatory condition and so when we don't have the right ratios from
good to bad we get a lot of gut inflammation and we also have gut permeability issues it's
called leaky gut which then can lead to things like autoimmune diseases but the point of this
video is just to increase awareness on it doesn't take that much sugar to create a problem whether
it's not being able to lose weight or fatigue or gut inflammation i mean if i remember back
when i was literally living on sugar on a daily basis wow did i have a lot of gut issues i had
bloating i had a serious irritable bowel syndrome and i would do all these cleanses and detoxes but
i never actually went on a low carb diet i took every single vitamin without any real results
but it really wasn't until i gave up sugar for real which by the way took
me a long time but i eventually did it and man did it create a huge effect on my body
so if you're not consistently giving up sugar you may want to try it for a longer period of
time just to prove to yourself that it creates a significant effect on your health so if you're

now is there any way to tell if you potentially could have a blood clot in this video i'm going
to discuss the seven different indicators that you possibly may have a blood clot now just because
you have any of these symptoms doesn't mean you have one but it's just good to understand how to
read your body and understand what these symptoms could be related to now the symptoms are directly
dependent on where the blood clots are you can have blood clots in your lung heart your leg
your brain and your pelvis these clots could be anywhere where there is a artery or a vein all
right number one leg cramps or tightness okay you could have this like throbbing
crampy tightness in your lower leg coming from something called deep vein thrombosis all right
number two shortness of breath because the clots are in your lung or in your heart you just get out
of breath very easily especially if you're doing any distance or inclines all right number three a
sudden increase or decrease in blood pressure number four an increase in pulse rate for no
reason it just doesn't come down number five swelling in the leg the foot or ankle or your arm
or your hand on one side usually all right number six excessive sweating and number seven discolored
skin it could be red or pale now there's other symptoms too like fatigue but these are the seven
most common symptoms so if you're getting any persistency with these symptoms it might be a
good idea just to get it checked out now i also want to add a couple really important nutrients
to help naturally keep your blood on the thin side but it's not actually thinning the blood it's just
preventing clots in general vitamin e specifically tocotrienols is a very good form of vitamin e
that can actually prevent clots second thing to take on a regular basis would be garlic
garlic naturally keeps the blood from clotting pierce a tin is a good remedy to keep the blood
from clotting as well turmeric is another one that's very very effective cayenne pepper
really good at preventing clots but here's the thing that you really need to know people that
are diabetic have a much higher risk of getting clots simply because they have higher levels of
sugar in their blood so people that have insulin resistance people that are pre-diabetic people
that are consuming a lot of sugar or doing a high carb diet are at a much higher risk of getting
clots so if you're concerned about that definitely get on the keto and intermittent fasting plan

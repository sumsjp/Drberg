now some of the symptoms from a vitamin d deficiency are very similar
to a calcium deficiency probably because you can cause a calcium deficiency if you don't
have enough vitamin d so i want to go to the list to see if you might need more calcium or
vitamin d first of all when you have low calcium you could have
similar symptoms to having peripheral neuropathy like like a diabetic would have numbness and
tingling in the fingers and the toes muscle spasm charlie horse you can have achy muscles very
similar to a vitamin d deficiency because vitamin d directs where calcium goes does it go into the
muscle or not and so if you're low in vitamin d you're going to have a lot of muscle aches
but definitely in your lower back okay your lower back is going to be very very weak
achy painful you're also going to have bone pain it could be anywhere in your body also with
vitamin d you're going to have more inflammation throughout the body but you're not going to
necessarily have that with low calcium now with a calcium deficiency you can have confusion
spasm in the throat you might have a hoarseness or a chronic cough that is low calcium you can also
be very very stiff you can also have tetane which is kind of a quivering of the muscle you can also
have these red spots like little bruising spots throughout the body as well now with low vitamin d
that can affect your mood you can feel sad depressed anxiety with low vitamin d you can
have high blood pressure also with low vitamin d you might have a hard time going to sleep
like you're really tired but your head cannot go to sleep that means you need calcium now with low
vitamin d it's going to affect your immune system you're going to be more susceptible to getting
sick and another way to look at this is from your diet are you avoiding all dairy we get a lot of
calcium from dairy but you also can get calcium from dark leafy green vegetables so if you're not
consuming any dairy let's say you have an allergy and if you don't like vegetables right there
you're probably going to be low on calcium also calcium is high in the fish trout it's also high
in clams and if you have high blood pressure and you're taking those calcium channel blockers
that can actually create a calcium deficiency as well so these are just little clues to kind
of narrow in on what you might be deficient in now i've done a lot more videos on vitamin d
than calcium but the reason why most people are deficient in vitamin d is they don't get enough
sun because it's almost impossible to get your vitamin d from from your diet you could
potentially do it if you consume a lot of fatty fish salmon things like that but rarely do people
do that but it mainly relates to the sun if you're overweight if you're older if your skin is darker
you're going to have more of a vitamin d deficiency now another point i want to bring up
calcium calcium is also influenced by magnesium if you have too much or too little magnesium you
can have a calcium deficiency so it's not just calcium in your diet okay it could be
your low vitamin d so you have to look at all these factors when you're trying to identify
um why you might have a certain symptom now the last point i want to bring up is your ph
if you're too alkaline you're not going to be able to absorb calcium so you may have high
levels of calcium but it's unavailable to you as well one last thing if you're low on vitamin k2
calcium can't be transported out of the joints it can't be transported out of the blood but in
this video i just wanted to differentiate this calcium from vitamin d deficiencies hey before

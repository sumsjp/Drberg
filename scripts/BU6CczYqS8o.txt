let's talk about what's behind a swollen face and puffy eyes now you may have this problem or you
may know people who have this problem and it's so easy to fix if you understand this one thing
there's two sources of fuel in the body there's glucose and then there's fat slash ketones well
actually that would be three but let's just keep the fat and ketones together since ketones are
made from fat so those are the two fuel sources and you store glucose as glycogen so glycogen
is the main storage of glucose and you store fat as adipose tissue storing glucose as glycogen is
extremely limited okay you only store a very small amount of it but with fat it has no limit it's
unlimited some people can gain weight over five six seven hundred pounds over a thousand pounds
and it just keeps going there's no limit the amount of fat that you can store but with glycogen
it's very very limited to around i would say 1700 calories now the question is why is it so limited
well it's because of this one thing it's extremely hydrated in order for your body to store
glucose as glycogen it requires a tremendous amount of water it will store a little more than
three times its weight in fluid so we're dealing with something that's extremely
waterlogged and there's just not enough space to store that much hydrated waterlogged material so
the way the body will handle that is that it'll take the excess glucose that comes from the diet
and very efficiently converts it over to fat so if you're consuming excess glucose in the diet
you're going to have more fat and you're going to have a lot more fluid and it shows up in the face
as a swollen face and especially around the eyes as puffy eyes in fact i had this problem
in some of the earlier videos i did when i wasn't doing intermittent fasting or the ketogenic diet
but the good news is if you have the right information it's very easy to
fix all you have to do is eliminate the excess amount of glucose in the diet now
this is where the confusion comes in what is considered excess and what is considered normal
if you take a look at the amount of glucose that normally should be in your blood when you test
your blood and measure your blood glucose and it says 80 milligrams per deciliter that's normal
that means you only have one tiny little teaspoon in the entire amount of blood in your body
so it's not very much our bodies are only designed to have a very tiny amount of sugar and that sugar
can be easily created from non-carbohydrate sources you do not need to consume sugar
to keep your blood sugars at 80. but the average person in America consumes 31 teaspoons of sugar
every single day so you can see the problem there's a lot of people walking around with
a swollen fat face with puffy eyes if you're new to my channel and you would like to know exactly

so today we're going to talk about the most common nutrient deficiency in irritable bowel disease now
this would include crohn's and ulcerative colitis now in both of these conditions you have a massive
amount of inflammation going on in your gut and you're also getting an overreaction of the immune
system and the more inflammation that occurs in your gut the less you're going to absorb nutrients
so if we take a look at all of the nutrients and identify the ones that are the most
deficient at the top of the list we have iron and iron deficiency which is going to create
anemia and that occurs because there's usually bleeding in your loss of blood
as well as the inflammation that prevents the absorption of iron one of the best sources of iron
is not the inorganic minerals that you get from the one a day vitamins that you're going to get
at the cvs drugstore but from animal products like organ meats beef has a lot of iron
and it's a type of iron that's easily absorbed but also spirulina is another good source of
iron so i always recommend getting your iron from actual food and you got to be careful because you
can actually overdo with iron iron is one of those minerals that is very difficult to get rid of
so it's very easy to develop in excess especially in men because with women they menstruate but
men they don't so men can actually build up a toxic accumulation of iron and that can create
cirrhosis of the liver so 80% of everyone with ibd irritable bowel disease has a iron
deficiency so that is the most common deficiency the second most common deficiency is vitamin d
70% of everyone with ibd has a vitamin d deficiency that's not surprising because the vast population
has a major deficiency of vitamin d now compounded by the fact that people don't
go outside very much they're overweight so they can't absorb as much and as they age it's more
difficult to absorb vitamin d but not to mention all that inflammation in your gut is preventing
the absorption of vitamin d vitamin d helps you absorb about 20 times more calcium than you would
if you didn't have vitamin d so you desperately need vitamin d for calcium also vitamin d is
needed to regenerate and repair the lining of your small intestine so without vitamin d
you have this situation where you have all this inflammation but you can't heal so it's a catch-22
the inflammation blocks vitamin d and the lack of vitamin d blocks inflammation and the repair
of the colon one of the most powerful effects of vitamin d is in its anti-inflammatory function
so without vitamin d you just stay inflamed so if you have ibd i would start taking
at least as a minimum 10,000 iu's of vitamin d3 and i would also recommend getting out in the sun
let the sun also give you a good amount of vitamin d all right the third category of deficiency would
be b12 in folate now both b12 and folate are made by microbes and they also come from food but when
you have inflammation your gut you have a altered microbiome which is going to limit your ability
to produce and absorb b12 as well as folate so with those two conditions you can have fatigue
a certain type of anemia and many other issues and the last category deficiencies would be
a deficiency of vitamin k1 and vitamin k2 vitamin k1 has everything to do with clotting
preventing bleeding and k2 has everything to do with making your bones really strong
and keeping the calcium out of the arteries and out of the joints and where it should belong in
the bones so if you have ibd make sure that you're getting these supplements so if you're

this is interesting zinc has the ability to starve off deadly bacteria we're talking about
streptococcus pneumonia and this was published in the journal of nature chemical biology now
normally this bacteria streptococcus pneumonia lives a part of our friendly bacteria as a normal
bacteria it's not pathogenic unless certain conditions occur but it lives in our sinuses
it lives in our throat and it's perfectly friendly until it becomes pathogenic especially when you're
zinc deficient and you're going through stress so when your immune system is compromised when you're
nutritionally deficient when you're stressed out when you have hiv tha t's when this microbe
flips over to become pathogenic and this is wild but this bacteria actually kills a million people
a year from pneumonia and meningitis a million people and you're going to find out just with a
little bit of zinc it could be totally prevented okay now what does zinc do to this bacteria
well this bacteria is dependent on another mineral called manganese manganese allows
for transportation okay it's dependent on this little transporter like a little car
so zinc goes in there and locks up the key so manganese cannot get in there anymore making
this transporter unavailable for this bacteria not to mention other things that zinc will do to
bacteria but this is a very powerful one so it's very very important that people get enough zinc in
their diet a zinc deficiency is probably one of the top nutritional deficiencies on this planet
primarily because of how much cereal that we consume because grains have phytic acid that block
zinc so you would want to avoid things with phytic acid i put a link down below of a video that i
just did on that also on the diet to get zinc you need red meat or shellfish or fish if you're a
vegan chances are you're going to be deficient in zinc due to the quantities of phytic acid
now if you also have gut inflammation or any type of gut issues you're going to have a difficult
time absorbing zinc and so it's just amazing to me of how this trace mineral needed in very
trace amounts very small amounts can create so much health and can prevent so much destruction
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system
it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here
what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

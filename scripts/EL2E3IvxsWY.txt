so diabetes and alcohol is a very bad combination let me explain why all it takes is very small
amounts of alcohol to really throw off your blood sugars in a big way especially if that alcohol is
sugary wine or cocktails or beer or margaritas so if you're a pre-diabetic alcohol can push you
faster to being a diabetic because it affects the cells of the pancreas the beta cells and so
you you'll start to lose function of those cells and so when there's a loss of function of insulin
there's no more regulation of blood sugar so the blood sugar goes up not to mention when
you're drinking alcohol you're depleting your b1 b1 is vitally important to prevent
lactic acidosis which can occur if you're diabetic people that take metformin most of the time have
a b1 deficiency because that's one of the side effects and one of the risk factors for metformin
is lactic acidosis where your body ph is too acidic because you're not able to metabolize
sugar that well the higher the sugars either from your blood sugars or within the diet
the more b1 that you need and so if there's not enough b1 in your bloodstream your body is going
to start pulling from the reserves and you'll eventually be deficient the other point is that
a lot of times alcohol is created from corn which is gmo or rice
or beet sugar which is gmo as well and that adds more chemicals to that product
when you drink alcohol the stored sugar called glycogen in your liver is not going to be as
available to you so you're not going to be able to tap into that stored sugar so the requirement for
medication is going to go higher and higher higher because your blood sugars are not going to be as
regulated also you lose the ability to detoxify alcohol if you're a diabetic so you get those
toxicities that can occur and then with the pancreas you could have increase or decrease
insulin depending on where you're at here's the moral of story avoid alcohol now if you're
slightly addicted and you can't do that right off the bat only drink with your meals okay
number three avoid the sugary drinks number four take b-1 in the form of nutritional yeast
this will be very beneficial you'll like it and you'll feel much better and number five kombucha
tea is a great alternative or substitute for alcohol you might want to try it it has similar
texture to beer or champagne it's carbonated and it can help you feel
like you're slightly drunk or should i say relaxed all right thanks for watching hey before

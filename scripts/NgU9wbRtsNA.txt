pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder
pmdd that's the topic for today and for
those of you that have it it can be
devastating but i'm going to tell you
even though this is a major problem for
people
if you understand what's going on it is
so
freaking easy to get rid of all right
what is pmdd
it's a severe form of pms
you have bloating headache breast
tenderness
and anxiety depression
and a lot of other symptoms now the
medical profession
is treating this
sometimes like a mental disorder it's in
the dsm 5 which is the diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders
which to me is just a bunch of
descriptive
terms for symptoms
of
pms and pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder
sounds very very scientific but the
whole goal is to get someone to manage
it then you have these support groups
right i used to when i was in practice i
did all these different
seminars at different support groups the
fibromyalgia support group the chronic
fatigue syndrome support group the
arthritis support group the peripheral
neuropathy support group and i always
hated going to these groups because
it was really weird you would do a
demonstration on someone you get
instant results and you would think
everyone would just
line up and want help
but it was very strange a lot of these
people in this group
got very upset
when you got rid of their problem i
don't know if that ever happened to you
when you try to help someone and they
actually might get upset when you try to
help them
so i always made it a policy that i'm
only going to help people that want help
and if you're watching this video
obviously you click the button and you
want help but then you go research on
kindle to find these books on
pmdd and they're just filled with
information but no really good
information that's going to correct
things it's all on how to live with the
problem more comfortably but the
question is how do we correct this so
what's going on well you have a hormonal
imbalance situation
usually you have this estrogen dominant
situation but it's really not an
estrogen dominant problem
estrogen is low but progesterone is
severely low giving you the appearance
of an estrogen dominant because of the
ratios both estrogen and progesterone
work reciprocally just like potassium
and magnesium so if you have too little
of one the other one's going to appear
to be
more dominant
so here's what you need to do number one
you need to avoid all dairy
milk
cheese
yogurt
completely eliminate this because that
can actually throw up your hormones
all right number two you need to start
consuming cruciferous
vegetables cruciferous vegetables have a
lot of phytoestrogens in them which help
to
regulate your estrogens so if you're
lacking some of the good estrogens it'll
give you more of that if you have too
much of the bad estrogen it will
lower that or you can take a product
called dim which is a concentrated
version of a certain phytonutrient in
cruciferous vegetables all right number
three sea kelp
sea kelp is awesome for
estrogen problems it's really magical
for things like fibrocystic breast
problem or breast tenderness but the
iodine in seek help helps to regulate
imbalances in
estrogen
all right and number four this is a must
vitamin d but it's not going to work if
you take 2 000 international units of
vitamin d you need to take at least
10 000 to 20 000 iu's of vitamin d every
day vitamin d is a great
anti-inflammatory
but it's also going to help regulate
calcium and that's going to help as well
so go ahead and apply these four things
and then comment down below on how fast
you're able to get rid of this problem

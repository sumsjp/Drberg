now herbs come from plants and plants have a lot of chemicals that can influence your body
including your hormones and so there are various herbal teas that you should avoid if you're
pregnant okay so this video is for pregnancy let's start with hibiscus tea it has certain
phytonutrients that can delay puberty if consumed in excess it could potentially cause a miscarriage
it can actually stimulate menstruation so avoid this tea if you are pregnant all right number two
nettle tea this has the potential to stimulate contractions of the uterus so this tea might
be good to take if you're just about ready to give birth and you want to
increase the contractions but not before number three all caffeinated teas this includes black
green white matcha chai why because there is some risk it could potentially increase the
risk of early pregnancy or even a miscarriage at 100 milligrams of caffeine the risk goes up by 2.4
times so i would keep your caffeinated beverages very very low of course this also includes coffee
next one is fennel tea fennel tea can increase your estrogen so you might want to avoid that
all right and then we have fennel greek tea well that's a tea that they use to induce labor so you
definitely want to avoid that one unless you're ready to deliver that baby and then we have
licorice tea you have to be careful with licorice tea because it can increase cortisol and cortisol
is a hormone that you don't want to have increase too much because it's a stress hormone during
pregnancy hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune

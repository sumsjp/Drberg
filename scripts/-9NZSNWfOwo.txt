you know there are a lot of people taking uh an aspirin today and there's some interesting
information that i'm going to share with you when you evaluate something you're always comparing
two or more things right if i were to tell you for example your blood sugars
are 250 right and you didn't know what normal was you would say well okay was that that sounds
good 250 i'm good with that but to really evaluate blood sugars you need to know what normal is right
so normal should be something like 80. 250 would be off the charts that would be diabetes if you
had a business and one of your statistics was success stories and one of your staff came in
and said hey we got 10 success stories this week you'd go oh that's great until you find out that
last week you had a hundred that's really bad right so when you're evaluating something you're
always comparing it to something if i were to tell you this amazing benefit of taking
this baby aspirin every single day would be the reduction of a cardiovascular event by 17 percent
you would be like wow that's amazing let me take that aspirin but if we then gave you all the data
the risks as well that might change your mind in three major credible studies which i'll put
the links down below this is what they found benefits 17 lower risk of cardiovascular events
but they also found a couple risks number one they found a 47 percent higher risk of gi bleeding in
your intestinal tract which by the way can then increase your risk of dying from internal bleeding
by 5 to 30 percent and on top of that they found a 37 percent increased risk of developing
intracranial hemorrhaging okay that's bleeding inside your skull so this is just another
really good example of the importance of having all the data that is correct when
you're evaluating something and so many times when you're researching things they don't really give
you the whole picture you have to dig and try to find this data and now i want to give you
some additional data some data on natural cox-2 inhibitors which basically will help reduce your
inflammation data on olive oil which can reduce inflammation without the side effects we have
olive oil turmeric ginger and green tea if you're new to my channel getting on a healthy keto diet
and doing intermittent fasting is another very very no-brainer to help you drop inflammation
systemically through the entire body hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

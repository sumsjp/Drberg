let's talk about the seven natural remedies for gout what is gout well gout is a sudden
sharp pain usually in your big toe formed by uric acid crystals because there's excessive
amount of uric acid forming as crystals in the joint of your big toe but it could
actually occur in other joints as well so what's happening is the uric acid is being formed from
purines which are certain compounds in organ meats especially liver and kidney
gain like deer meat fish seafood sugar yeast even nutritional yeast some people are if you're
sensitive to that that can actually increase the risk of getting gout also in certain lentils and
black eyed peas but for the most part vegetables are very low on purine so if you're sensitive
to gout you want to increase your vegetables and your diet and cut down some of the things that can
trigger the gout but these crystals aren't the real thing that's causing the pain
it's not that there's sharp little razor blade crystals that's you know irritating the the toe
joint what's happening is your white blood cells consider the crystals a pathogen so it's attacking
it so it's really your own immune system that's causing inflammation so what can you do about
it well number one you can reduce these foods number two you can tweak the ph of your body to
make it slightly more alkaline because these crystals develop in more of an acidic medium
so one thing you could do is take something that's alkaline potassium citrate that would
help lemon juice even though it's acid becomes alkaline in your body after it's oxidized so
lemon juice is actually very good now even though apple cider vinegar is an acid it seems to help
reduce uric acid crystals now what i think that's really happening and that's just a guess is the
apple cider vinegar is acidifying the body and improving the immune system to a certain degree
vitamin c has been known to decrease gout pain ginger is a very powerful natural remedy for uric
acid also turmeric is good stinging nettle root is another good anti-inflammatory i like this a lot
for any type of inflammatory condition in the body and of course like i said potassium citrate these
are the seven things that i would recommend if you have gout before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

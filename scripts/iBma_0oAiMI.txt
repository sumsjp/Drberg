Hi guys I'm back to do a video comparing hydroxychloroquine to remdesivir
which is another drug that they've just got done studying and I want to just
compare the two so there's been a big mistake by the World Health Organization
when they sent the study to various publications so The Lancet medical
journal was rushing to publish a study right away because of the success of
this drug and they accidentally sent the wrong study they sent a Chinese trial
which by the way was randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled with
237 patients the problem with publishing the wrong study using this drug by the
way there was not an association with statistically significant clinical
benefits with this medication whoops so they republished the correct study
that they wanted to show which involved over a thousand patients and it was
randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial but it only
really showed a moderate improvement in recovery time from 15 days of recovery
to 11 days of recovery it's like a 30% improvement but really nothing else and
of course this drug is not going to be cheap it's seven hundred and fifty
percent more than the flu vaccine so you see this in the media they're really
excited they finally found a drug that is somewhat workable it's a good start
as they completely ignore the hydroxychloroquine in fact the media
tends to filter out and showing in the studies that don't work or actually make
it worse when and actually they're just really bogus studies they were based on
a survey it's not a credible study but unless you read it you're not gonna find
that out and by the way as a side note hydroxychloroquine does decrease the
risk of thrombosis and if you haven't seen my video on the relationship
between clotting and the COVID-19 virus check it out just another benefit
of this drug however there is a new study I'm going to put all these links
down below of a French virologist who tested hydroxychloroquine and an
antibiotic that showed that ninety one point seven percent of all the patients
that were tested for COVID-19 in 10 days did not test
positive for the virus this is incredible this should be on the front
page of that is not this drug right here the mortality rate or death rate was 0.5
percent with no cardiac toxicities and this is an extremely inexpensive drug I
think it's like $1 a treatment obviously the drugs that are really cheap don't
get a lot of attention now I'm glad you stayed this far because I'm going to
show you an amazing story and Africa related to this drug that I think you'll
enjoy it's not just the Western world that has the scientific know-how to beat
the virus in Senegal a laboratory is used it's aids and Ebola experience to
develop a $1 COVID-19 testing kit al-jazeera's nicholas hawk has more
senegal is doing what most countries counts testing everyone symptoms are not
entering a health center for the novel coronavirus it has no shortage of
testing kit thanks to this lab at the STG beste researchers are developing a
$1 quick diagnostic kit originally made to test for dengue fever patients drop
blood or saliva onto the devices and wait for a blood line to appear like a
pregnancy test explains researcher a Medusa
there is no need for a highly equipped lab it's a simple test that can be done
anywhere the idea is to rapidly produce two to
four million kids not just for us but for African countries so that we can
detect it and isolate patients quickly the sick are administered a cheap
anti-malarial drug called chloroquine commonly found in sub-saharan Africa
where malaria is endemic with only 50 ventilator machines for 16
million people Senegalese engineer are using a 3d printing machine to produce
more while imported ventilators cost $16,000 this one is just $60 Senegal is
counting the cost and it's paying off more than a month into the outbreak the
small West African nation suffered only two deaths with most patients treated
healed Senegal has the largest rate of recovery in patients infected with the
coronavirus in Africa the third in the world ahead of countries like the United
States and France and while it has a tiny health budget compared to those
countries it has a wealth of experience in dealing with infectious diseases and
outbreaks amazing isn't it inexpensive great success rate put your comments

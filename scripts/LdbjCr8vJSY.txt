so there's a real interesting book that i'm reading now called hooked
by michael moss fascinating and he talks about your brain on processed foods and he does this
interesting comparison between alcohol tobacco and drugs versus an addiction to cheeseburger
fries or ice cream which is interesting because the speed at which the sugar
touches your tongue and connects to the reward circuitry of your brain is about 600 milliseconds
that's a little more than a half of a second and that's 20 times faster than if you were to smoke a
cigarette and have nicotine enter the brain and so this book is about really how much more addicting
these processed foods are compared to alcohol smoking or even drugs which is actually you would
think those are much more addictive and he gets into some interesting data with food companies and
how they have suppressed a lot of the research was with sugar and how they have influenced various
laws to prevent being sued by any side effects that occur from consuming processed foods
and another thing that's interesting is that in the 70s food companies started buying up the diet
industry so for example heinz the company heinz bought weight watchers i'm not sure who owns
it now the company unilever which makes those klondike bars and they even own ben and jerry's
they bought slim fast for 2.3 billion dollars and of course slimfast right now also sells their
keto version so you can have the sugar version or the keto version depending on who you are nestle
bought jenny craig so it's interesting that the companies that are making processed foods are
also the companies that are helping you lose weight and so the other thing i want to talk
about is how they actually diagnose an addiction slash substance use disorder there are actually 11
criteria that are used okay i'm going to go through this number one hazardous use
is the substance dangerous to yourself or others can you overdose on it number two
social or interpersonal problems related to use relationship problems or conflict with others all
right number three neglected major roles uh you have failed to meet your responsibility at work
school or home because of substance use before withdrawal when you stop using the
substance you experience withdrawal symptoms well that definitely shows up with sugar
tolerance you have built up the tolerance to the substance so you have to use it more to get the
same effect that's definitely related to processed foods and sugar number six use larger amounts or
use the substance for longer amounts of time number seven repeated attempts to control use or
quit you've tried to cut back or quit entirely but have not been successful all right number eight
much time spent using you spend a lot of time using the substance or eating the processed food
well people spend a lot of time eating right and snacking number nine physical or psychological
problems related to use your substance use has led to physical health problems such as liver damage
well that's fatty liver right or lung cancer or psychological issues such as depression or anxiety
well that's definitely related to processed foods number 10 activities given up to use you have
skipped activities or stopped doing activities you once enjoyed in order to use the substance well
you stopped exercising right and number 11 craving you have experienced cravings for the substance
now what's interesting about this they gave you 11 criteria if you meet two or three of the criteria
you have a mild substance abuse disorder four to five is considered moderate and if you meet
six or more criteria you have a severe substance use disorder and so i definitely think that
processed foods and sugar definitely fit in the category of addictions

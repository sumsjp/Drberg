hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about low cortisol now I've done
a lot of videos on high cortisol what it can do in this video we're gonna talk about low cortisol now
cortisol has a lot of good benefits it actually helps you but too much of it or too little of it
you can mess you up so one of the causes of low cortisol would be cortisol resistance and that
means that you had high levels of cortisol over a long period of time or high levels of stress and
the receptors for cortisol started to downgrade and get blocked so now it's just very similar
to insulin resistance in that you can't absorb it anymore so here you have the situation where the
cells don't get the benefit of cortisol despite high levels of cortisol the feedback loops come
right around to the adrenals sensing the course while it starts pumping out more course also you
have situation of high cortisol and low cortisol so now you have the bad effects of belly fat you
know high blood pressure and all those issues and bone loss but then you don't have all the natural
anti-inflammatory effects so you get inflammatory conditions arthritis bursitis tendinitis all the
type of inflammatory things because cortisol is normally an anti-inflammatory okay so you lose
that that's why that we go to a doctor they will give you prednisone or cortisone creams
for the skin rashes and allergies and itching and asthma and arthritis they inject you with
cortisone shots because cortisol has the benefit of getting rid of inflammation low immunity if you
don't have the benefit of course so you can get sick easily you can have problems with autoimmune
problems allergies okay I mean think about what they a lot of times for allergies they'll give
you a cortisone apprentice own asthma asthma if you don't have enough cortisol you you can
have problems with asthma asthmatic i mean a bronco coracoid steroid inhaler they're giving
you cortisone right because they you don't have enough you don't have enough adrenal function
low stress tolerance so your tolerance for stress is pretty crappy so because you don't have enough
course also you get edgy easily low vitamin D level so you don't regulate those properly and
then poor memory so cortisol actually helps the memory if you have normal amounts if you don't
have it you can have issues with memory but other night you're perfectly fine right so one
of the things I use not to cure this thing but just to help support the adrenal glands I have
something called cortisol support formula now this is not for people with high cortisol it's
for people with low cortisol to help support a healthy adrenal has some interesting things that
has three of the ingredients are food based vitamin C complexes they're not synthetic if
you take a lot of synthetic vitamin C you will weaken the adrenals the adrenal -- supports most
of the it's like a vitamin c reserve in the body because you need the vitamin c to not just a make
cortisol but to make adrenal hormone I mean I'm sorry adrenaline and the other hormones
that are produced by the adrenal - like adrenaline noradrenaline all those are called catecholamines
you need vitamin c is a precursor for that so it's three food based vitamin c complexes it
has it's not a vegan product so it has grass-fed adrenal extract it is grass-fed liver extract
which also helps the cortisol regulate itself it has two versions of vitamin b5 which is also good
to help bolster the adrenal it has licorice root trace minerals so it's a it's a real good product
to bring the person up I would take three a day ok so that is something you can do also
too you want to fix this you have to avoid the source so you're going to have to start
looking at what is stressing you out and really focus on that you're gonna have to focus on your
sleep you're going to have to do walking not a high intensity you're gonna have to change your
environment so you're not in stress dates as much whether it's work home or whatever ok so anyway
I put a link down below if you want to check out the course or support and thank you for watching

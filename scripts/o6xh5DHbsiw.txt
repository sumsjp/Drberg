hi guys I have another question why does my urine have a strong stinky odor okay
we're going to talk about that now if you are not on a ketogenic program and
you're not doing intermittent fasting and you have that odor it could be a
urinary tract infection it could be liver damage it could be you're eating
the wrong foods you're not having enough vegetables okay but if you are on a keto
intermittent fasting program it could either be the ketones that are not being
burned coming out initially when you're adapting to ketosis there's this
transitional period of a key to adaptation and in that process you're
going to have more ketones coming out of your urine and sometimes is a bit
stronger than it should be but when you do it a little longer you'll be burning
those ketones because your system is more efficient and chances are you're
not going to be eating as much fat because your body is more efficient so
what's going to happen is you're going to have burn up more ketones and less
odor over time okay now if it's ammonia like
that would be the smell of you ever have one of those CDs that that you would
stick in your car or some type of CD player and you take the plastic off to
smell that plastic kind of ammonia type smells like a chemically type smell now
this usually is too much protein okay so what are you going to do to kind of
counter this kind of nasty smell there's a couple things number one you want to
support the liver with certain types of vegetables for example you want to do
more beet tops in your salad a real good one would be dandelion greens okay you
get them out to help restore you give them in your backyard but just make sure
if you have a dog you know they're it's claim because sometimes they urinate on
those little weeds but this weed the dandelion greens is amazing for liver
rejuvenation okay so you want to have some of those bitter greens for the
liver and that will actually clean up a lot of the odor especially if it's
ammonia or it actually even ketones you want to start to make sure you have
enough fluid so don't go the whole day just with like a
half a cup of fluid make sure you consume you could put electrolytes but
dis drink a little bit more fluid because especially when you're doing
keto it's almost it acts as a diuretic and you get rid of excess waste that way
so it's kind of cleaning but you need to replace some liquids as well and then if
you exercising on top of that you probably need more fluids but my whole
point is don't drink more than you're thirsty for but make sure you're having
enough the other thing is you want to adjust your proteins I don't recommend
doing the Atkins diet which is heavier on the proteins or a high protein diet
it's called moderate protein three to six ounces if you have too much protein
you're definitely definitely going to have more ammonia type smell all right
and lastly chlorophyll is a great deodorizer it's a detoxifier you can get
liquid chlorophyll you can use my wheatgrass this stuff
right here one teaspoon is a whole tray of wheatgrass and it just helps to
purify clean the system so it's high in chlorophyll and it'll actually counter
that bad odor alright thanks for watching hey if you

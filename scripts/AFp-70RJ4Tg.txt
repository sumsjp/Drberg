let's talk about insulin's partner glucagon now glucagon sounds like glucose because it's
involved in the regulation of glucose so let's just talk about what this hormone is
because i don't want to neglect this very important hormone glucagon simply because i'm
emphasizing this insulin in almost you know 50 of my videos but let's take a look at this so insulin
has a job of pushing the blood sugar down okay it takes the sugar out of the blood to regulate
the blood sugar so it gets triggered by a high carb diet and that's what insulin does so it's
constantly pushing things down it's doing other things as well like storing fat and storing
glucose as glycogen but it's helping you regulate blood sugars by lowering it to a normal level
right then you have this hormone glucagon that's pushing it up so it's countering it and both of
these hormones work together to keep your blood sugar at normal so glucagon is kind of like a
counter regulatory hormone to prevent hypoglycemia because if you have massive amount of you know
carbohydrate and massive amounts of insulin that could push this thing way down here to a dangerous
level where your blood sugar there's nothing left and your body can't have that so this is one of
the hormones that will help bring it back up so what does it do it mobilizes glycogen which is
stored sugar okay to glucose in your liver so it's kind of taking all the stored sugar in your liver
and making it available to you to be able to bring this back up so that's one thing it does
number two it activates gluconeogenesis this is the formation of new sugar so it'll turn
amino acids from your diet and fat into sugar or glucose for two reasons number
one to keep this blood sugar up to a normal level but also if you're not eating any sugar
and certain parts of your your body like the red blood cell parts of the eye parts of the
brain parts of the kidney need glucose they can't use ketones they can't use fatty acids
so a certain part of our body needs glucose but don't think you need to consume glucose because
this hormone can turn non-carbohydrate material into glucose okay so your body will make as much
glucose as it needs because of this hormone there's other hormones that will help but this is
one that also helps we'll also enhance lipolysis this is fat burning it'll help to mobilize fat
especially after you've burned up all the sugar and used up all the stored glucose
and you say you're not eating glucagon comes in there and mobilizes the fat tissue and
releases the fatty acids into the tissues to feed them as well as into the liver to make
ketones or your cells can use fatty acids directly okay so now what is insulin is triggered by it's
triggered by carbs higher amounts of amine protein like amino acids so if you eat a
high protein meal okay so that can trigger insulin frequent eating and msg can trigger insulin
glucagon is triggered by low glucose okay low blood sugar as in a ketogenic diet okay it can
also be triggered by amino acids in the blood all right now look at this amino acids protein can be
triggered by this hormone and this hormone but what's the difference between the two hormones
well if you have a high protein meal very large amounts of protein okay you're going to get
more of an insulin spike if you have a moderate amount of protein or adequate amount of protein
then this guy is being triggered but just realize that this will be triggered to some degree with
any type of protein because every time you eat anything you will trigger insulin so this is why
protein is kind of interesting because you have both of these hormones will be triggered the
point is that if you keep your protein moderate it's going to be more of this being triggered and
even if there's some insulin being triggered this hormone will kind of keep it in check
so it doesn't become out of control all right then we have exercise exercise will trigger glucagon
what type of exercise it's the high intensity type or something that's exhausting or something
that's a very high pulse rate type exercise that'll trigger glucagon and also other hormones
like growth hormone so obviously we need both of these mechanisms in place what i would recommend
is stick with the low carb moderate protein routine exercise to keep this in normal avoid
the excess carbs avoid the high protein diets avoid the frequent eating and also the msg so

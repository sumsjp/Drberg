so the other day i was looking through my youtube videos and i was shocked to
find out i had no videos on constipation that i could
find so i decided to do one and this relates
to two situations one is that you develop
constipation after you do the ketogenic diet
versus having constipation years before you do the ketogenic diet
now if you've had constipation your whole life okay that's a different
situation i would highly recommend you go to
a doctor that can evaluate that deeper maybe get some type of scan to look
at your intestines because many times the large
colon is completely dilated and distended to the point where it's
going to take a lot of work and a long time
for people that had long term constipation and they've tried all sorts
of things i'm going to recommend some type of herbal laxative i'll put
some links down below now some people are concerned about
being dependent on herbal laxatives well the danger of having constipation
or auto intoxication with all those toxins being recirculated
is much greater than taking an herb to help you eliminate these toxins
now there's also many other things you can do for constipation but i'm going to
answer that when i deal with this other situation
you just started keto and all of a sudden you got
constipated now i know someone's going to say in the comment section well what
about diarrhea because that's what i had i already did a video on that i put the
link down below so you just did keto you got constipation this is the order
of things that i would take a look at you want to first adjust your vegetables
a lot of people are not used to seven to ten cups of vegetables
it may constipate them why because what is consuming that fiber
is your microbes and you need to kind of build up these microbes
you may not have enough to deal with that much
fiber so you may want to start out with like i don't know
four cups of vegetables slowly go to five six seven
over time so overloading these microbes with too much fiber
could constipate you the other point is too when you
take fiber in it's going to swell up with fluid
if you're not drinking water after you consume the vegetables
there could be a problem with kind of dehydrating your colon
because of the gel effect with fiber it basically
absorbs water it expands and it helps to form the stool
so we want to adjust the quantity either up or down some people
get constipation by consuming a lot of protein with no vegetables
well then you might want to increase the vegetables so first thing is increase
the quantity up or down to see if that handles it
second thing is the type of vegetable if you're consuming a lot of cruciferous
vegetables some people don't do well with that they can't
digest it as well so you might want to switch the type of
vegetables that you consume it could be like like green lettuce
leaves that might be something you could do
or asparagus or celery just change the type
next thing you can do is also switch to fermented vegetables sauerkraut kimchi
many different types and this is much easier to digest
the other thing you can do is you can steam some of your vegetables like maybe
half of them and have half raw that seems to also
help the ability to digest and process that
fiber so this would be number one number two you are not
ready to handle that much fat on the ketogenic plan
because your bile reserves are not sufficient so you have a certain amount
of bile that you've been using to digest food so you switch your
diet to a higher fat diet and now the requirement for bile goes
up because bile helps you break down fat it's like the detergent that dissolves
the fat so you may need to add some purified bile salts after the meal
to assist in the digestion of the fat okay that's the next thing i
would look at and by the way bile salts are a natural lubricant so it'll help
you lubricate the colon and it's actually good for constipation
next thing is you want to add more potassium potassium
helps the smooth muscle of the colon so you may want to take some electrolyte
powder you just want to beef up no pun intended your amount of
potassium okay number four you add a probiotic of
course you'd want to do this this and this with the long-term
constipation too but a good probiotic can help you break down these fibers i
would recommend something that survives the stomach
acidity but adding a probiotic is a very vital
thing that you don't want to forget about
number five add a herbal laxative if you need it
as a temporary thing and number six b1 if you're deficient in b1 you could lack
the necessary neurotransmitters to help activate the
muscles in the colon so b1 naturally helps the peristalsis or
the pumping action of the colon another common thing that a
lot of people do with keto is to do mct oil
mct oil has a natural laxative effect so in the process you may want to use
some of this to help keep things going all right there you

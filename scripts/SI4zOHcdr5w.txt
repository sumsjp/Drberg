I want to talk about the difference between fasting and keto and which one
is better I had this question come up underneath one of the descriptions in my
youtube videos so I'm going to just talk about it so when we talk about keto
we're talking about low-carb now you could do keto with zero carbs you could
do that but most people have just a small amount of carb they might have it
between 20 and 50 grams but when you're doing fasting you're bringing it down to no
carbs because you're not eating anything okay so just for the fact that you have
no carbs means that you're gonna have way more ketones than when you do
actually do keto if you compare them together now with keto you're gonna be
eating at a certain frequency and every time you eat regardless of what you eat
if there's any any significance of calories you're gonna stimulate
something called GIP okay that's in the small intestine that triggers a spike in
insulin so even though you're consuming low carbohydrates you are stimulating
insulin when you eat to a certain degree but over here when you're fasting
there's no GIP stimulated so you're gonna have a lot lower insulin and a lot
more ketones that are generated all right next thing is that when you
actually are in ketones you will stimulate certain genes that will help
you in various ways but when you're fasting you actually enhance even
additional genes that have to do with survival and definitely have to do with
anti-aging and longevity which will help the brain become more focused and the
heart to become more efficient and those ketones that are generated for both will
actually increase more oxygen in the body and less co2 and ketones in general
act as antioxidants now with fasting you're going to get much more autophagy
and that is a condition where your body is recycling old damaged proteins and
turning them into new tissue now with ketosis you are going to get some
autophagy but not nearly as much so just by looking at these two alone you can
see that fasting has a much more powerful impact
on your health than just ketosis now I recommend you combine them together
because they will have a compounded effect the benefits will be enhanced
because doing one will help the other doing this will help that it'll be
easier to do because when you're doing fasting and then you eat if you actually
eat keto less carbs your cravings will be diminished you won't be hungry
as much but if you're doing fasting and doing higher carbohydrates you may find
that number one it's gonna bump you out of ketosis for longer and you're gonna
be actually craving for more carbs so that's one little issue with that so
eating keto makes fasting easier now when you're doing keto and not doing
intermittent fasting you may not see the benefits that you would especially with
weight loss anti-aging cognitive effects especially if you're doing keto
with keto snacks so you're doing three meals with a snack in the morning lunch
and at night you're probably going to really diminish your results so if
you're trying to lose weight and you're doing keto but not IF and you have a
slow metabolism you may find that you're gonna actually stall or plateau sooner
or later so combining both of these will definitely allow you to achieve your
health goals much faster now if you're new to my channel and you're not sure
how to do it I'm gonna recommend doing what's called the healthy version of
keto as well as intermittent fasting and I put a link down below of exactly where
to get that plan so I wanted to say thank you so much
for watching my videos I really really appreciate it
now if you have benefited from my information or videos and want to share
it with the world I would love to have you write up a success story so click the
link down below fill it out and let's let people know the benefits of healthy
keto and intermittent fasting

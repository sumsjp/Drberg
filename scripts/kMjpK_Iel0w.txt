did you realize that there's a third function of your immune system well that's we're going
to talk about today the immune system helps you fight pathogens it also helps you kill cancer
in tumor cells but it's also involved in a third function and that would be wound healing now this
goes beyond inflammation and there's a cell that you have called macrophages and a macrophage means
big cell that eats and it's one of the first lines of defense against uh infections
to comply so it's kind of like a guard that waits for some pathogen to invade the body
and then it will just go after and heat it up there's another phagocyte called neutrophils
now the neutrophils are really like the main front line of defense and then you have the
macrophage that actually will back them up but they both tend to work together
now when you have acute inflammation like let's say a new injury or an infection that would be
the neutrophils that jump in there and do their job but when we get into chronic inflammation then
we're talking about the macrophages because even the macrophages will eat up the dead neutrophils
and they're more involved in the chronic type inflammatory condition so any condition that has
an itis at the end of it like bursitis tendinitis arthritis iliitis and the list goes on and on
and on the macrophage is involved with that so there's so many different conditions that involve
inflammation which basically brings the blood and brings other things to the area for healing
so what happens when you have inflammation in various organs whether it's the liver
the kidneys the tendon the muscles the arteries or the colon that inflammation
can then turn into scar tissue so you have two different things you have the normal healing cycle
then you have something called pathogenic inflammation or pathogenic wound healing
and now you have this tissue that's permanent that doesn't allow oxygen to go into it and it becomes
dysfunctional and the more of that tissue you have the more chronic inflammation you're going to have
and the more free radical damage you're going to have and then you're also going to have
a lack of function in that area so the macrophage is involved with wound healing
whether it's normal or pathogenic every time you work out at the gym and you damage your muscles
the macrophage will come in there and help repair the muscle it brings in certain growth factors for
regeneration and the macrophage which is a white blood cell actually will eat up the damaged tissue
and it will also bring in growth factors and fibrin which actually forms the scar tissue matrix
and it's stimulated with hypoxia or lack of oxygen so that's a trigger to recruit these macrophages
what is the significance of this how am i going to use this information
well the same nutrition that supports the white blood cells for immune protection is the same
nutrition that you would use to support wound healing so let me give you an example
ulcers the remedy for that would be zinc because zinc will stimulate the macrophages
to help heal ulcers okay so that would be one example another example would be vitamin d vitamin
d is essential for your immune system to prevent excessive amounts of over reaction or inflammation
so if you have some type of condition where you have chronic inflammation whether it's in the
nervous system or the joints or wherever so you'd want to take vitamin d to support that macrophage
all right here's another thing you can do there's this transition from inflammation to scar tissue
and it just so happens that tocotrinols which is a very specific type of vitamin e will slow
down that process and really what it's doing it's actually helping support the macrophage in slowing
down the release of that fibrous scar tissue so it basically stops these immune cells from producing
too much excessive amounts of scar tissue now that could be in the lung that can be in your liver
that can be in your arteries that can be in the colon that can actually be high levels of
iron because you have too much you're taking too much iron it could be an infection some type of
microbe that's doing it it can be too much calcium in your body in which case you would need vitamin
k2 to extract it or it could be too much glucose glucose or sugar actually depletes antioxidants
and it destroys the vascular system to different tissues it's a huge oxidizer that then causes a
lot of free radical damage so of course what i'm saying is get on the keto diet if you're
not already on one and then the last thing that really creates a lot of inflammatory condition
would be omega-6 fatty acids the soy oil the canola oil the corn oils all the vegetable oils
create a lot of oxidation which then creates a lot of damage and what's happening inside the
body is you're creating these wounds inside the arteries inside the liver inside your tendons
and the macrophages come in there and try to heal it but if you don't get rid of the trigger
or provide the right nutrients it develops into this excessive chronic inflammatory scar tissue
situation where your body just can't heal so we have tocotrinols zinc vitamin d are essential
but also fasting so fasting is very very powerful to not only slow down inflammation but to help
stimulate your macrophages into cleaning up all the damaged proteins that have developed from the
scar tissue all right guys thanks for watching and if you haven't seen my video on the immune system
i put a link down below check it out before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

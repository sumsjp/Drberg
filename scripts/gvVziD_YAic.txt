hey guys it's dr. Berg here I wanted to create a short video for those people
who cannot for the life of them give up sweets okay so we have to define what an
addiction is versus just a habit you know people that crave sweets a lot of
times don't realize they are addicted they may just say I love sweets but
here's an addiction addiction is something that if I were to tell you
can't have it anymore you would say now I can't live with that I have to have it
so it's a it's a thing where you cannot resist alright so are you addicted okay
you are alright good that's the first thing to acknowledge you have an
addiction a habit is something that maybe you remember it and it's
pleasurable but you don't have to have it
okay so sweets are so addicting even more than drugs it's huge it's
everywhere everywhere you go grocery stores and it's constantly on their mind
so especially if you go on a diet now you're going to want it more because
that's about depriving and telling you you can't have it so that's a bad
strategy so I have a better strategy for you you just need to instead of
depriving yourself we need to substitute something that gives you the exact same
pleasure as the sweets okay but without the sugar okay there are a lot of
different different sweeteners that you can use I create a little book actually
it's a healthy substitute pleasure book that has in here amazing little recipes
candy bars chocolate bars English muffins there's even a bread recipe
cookies healthy granola look at this peanut peanut butter cups more cookies
ice cream and this is made with healthy alternative sugars so there's no sugar
no bad stuff no flour but it gives you the exact same sensation so this allows
you to actually do a program why wouldn't you want to do a program that
would replace it exactly because there's really no good in
at all there's nothing good in sugar at all so when you do this you avoid the
blood sugar spikes and over time the receptors for sugar that have been
downgraded which I mean adapted to how much sugar that a person was eating now
they become upgraded which means that when you eat sugar now it's like too
sweet like right now if I ate sugar I was like I can't stand I don't even like
the sensation of sugar I think what's really wild is when you do this over a
period of time and realize that it's not normal to have cravings it's not normal
to have this incredible desire to like sweet
that's not a normal healthy sensation that that you should like it's going to
blow your mind I mean right now I have no interest in sugar at all and people
look at me like are you crazy you don't like sugar but when I was eating sugar I
wanted it more and more and more I was in I was the worst I was trapped in a
thing where I had to go get Ben and Jerry's ice cream every single night and
I would eat a pint and I did that over and over and over for several years yeah
I did that I was in that trap it is a trap so so it's really simple you just
need to have replacements that are healthy and then you do that over a
period of time might be 2 weeks might be a month might be 2 months what will
happen is that your sugars will love you lose a lot of weight too but your
sensitivity to sugar will go up and all of a sudden things are way too sweet so
then even if you did eat sugar it will be satisfying just a little bit will be
and you'll be fine so this is a good way to get out of the trap the sugar trap
and to do this comfortably so you're not depriving yourself so I highly suggest
getting this book I created a link down there and start using these recipes
because out of all the things that you can eat I think sugar
honestly creates more problems for people than any other thing health-wise
all right I'll see in the next video

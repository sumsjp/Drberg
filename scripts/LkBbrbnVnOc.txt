let's talk about some common unfriendly keto foods and what you would do to swap them out
with some healthier keto friendly foods all right first one is the bun on a burger my favorite is
using the bib butter head lettuce this one's really good roasted portobello mushroom top you
can use that napa chinese cabbage is another good one and then wraps if you're doing some type of
sandwich you can make your own cauliflower wraps okay now karen my wife has an amazing recipe for
that i put the link down below and let's talk a little bit more about that in a bit with another
recipe of course white sugar you can do allulose which i just did a video on this one is one of my
favorites xylitol is another one i use erythritol and monk fruit or erythritol and stevia also work
those are good now as far as a syrup goes if you want to use a substitute for maple syrup they have
xylitol syrup in the past i did recommend some other syrups but i no longer recommend
those because they do affect your blood sugars but pretty safe with the xylitol syrup and then let's
say you want a good swap for a cereal you can buy roasted coconut chips and take slivered almonds
berries you can put some chia seed flax seed maybe even sunflower seeds in there
if you want and then take organic plain whole milk bulgarian yogurt with that that would make a great
cereal now white flour you can use almond flour you can also use coconut flour but it's a little
bit dry i think almond flour is going to be the best option and then we get noodles okay so
spiral cut zucchini is my favorite you can also use spaghetti squash and also shirataki noodles
as well now the next one is lasagna noodles this is the one that is my favorite right here
my wife has this recipe that is to die for it's lasagna it's amazing i put the link down
below i highly suggest if you like lasagna you can make this the noodles in this lasagna is
the same recipe for the cauliflower wrap so i will link down below how to make the wrap
and the entire lasagna dish it's really really good and then we have the potato which you can
substitute for mashed cauliflower you can put a lot of butter in there you could put some garlic
sea salt pepper maybe some sour cream it's really good and for your rice substitute cauliflower
rice i put the link down below how to make that and pizza crust there's many different kinds i
still like the cauliflower slash egg slash cheese crust so this video is just about substitutions
and any time you tell people you can't have something they want it more you have to give
them a substitute here's a good list as a starting point before you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

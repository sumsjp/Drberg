so I had a question what is better as an antiviral using soap to wash your
hands or alcohol let's talk about that this will be a fairly short video so
when we compare using soap and alcohol and I'm talking 60% of it being alcohol
there's some differences here alcohol can definitely help inactivate
many different microbes including viruses okay
but I only recommend using an alcohol gel if you don't have soap available why
because soap is much much more effective simply because a virus has a fat layer
as its envelope and soap is a detergent it's half fat it could be animal fat or
plant fat and half alkaline salts so soap is an interesting combination
between fat soluble and water soluble it works together so you use soap as a
detergent to break down grease fats and other things that are even water soluble
and so what this soap does is it breaks down the fat layer of the virus so not
only does it destroy the virus it also separates it from your hands so in other
words your hand also is a fat layer so adding soap can take this sticky virus
and allow it to be released from your hands whereas alcohol can't do that
alright so that's it for this video thanks for watching

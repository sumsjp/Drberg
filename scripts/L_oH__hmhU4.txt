so you wake up in the middle of night with your heart racing what could that be well the first
thing you want to do is differentiate between is your heart rate really increasing or do you have
palpitations because they can feel very similar and so ideally you'd want to check your pulse
to see if your pulse rate is higher tachycardia is a medical name for a high pulse rate over 100
beats per minute the normal beats per minute should be around 72 but it could be actually
a lot lower if you're in shape or it could be slightly higher or palpitation is a little bit
different it's not necessarily a sustained high pulse rate it the heart is flipping or flopping
or speeding up temporarily or slowing down temporarily but i do have videos
on palpitation slightly different than this i put a link down below but we want to talk about
if you're all of a sudden waking up in the middle of night with a high pulse rate what's going on
let's take a look at all the potential causes of tachycardia well alcohol will do it too much sugar
will do it because sugar depletes potassium potassium is kind of like a governor or a
regulator of your pulse rate and so without potassium you don't have the brakes in the car
so it's all accelerators so the pulse rate will go up in fact i remember right before i got married
we were living in san diego and we were going around trying to find the best wedding cake
and so we were going to different places sampling wedding cakes and then we ended up at an italian
restaurant and had pizza and pasta and wine and right before they're closing i realized
we were the last people left and so the waiter said would you like to sample some of these
these desserts before we toss them out and of course i don't want to waste any food so we
sampled everything and so i was driving home that night with a tremendous amount of carbohydrates
flowing through my bloodstream and right when i went to bed i noticed this large pounding in my
ear it's like boom boom boom boom my pulse rate was not only accelerated but it was loud what
was happening in my blood was all this sugar was depleting the potassium that i had and so there's
nothing left to keep the pulse rate under control so too much sugar will deplete potassium and your
pulse rate will go up and you will not be able to sleep also just having low potassium in general
can increase the pulse rate low magnesium can increase the pulse rate and if you are b1
deficient which by the way is very very common your pulse rate will be a little bit too high
so you'd want to take some nutritional yeast to get that b1 and your pulse rate should come down
stimulants like caffeine from coffee also chocolate and tea will keep the pulse rate
too high an overactive thyroid will keep your pulse rate high i did a video on this and one
of the remedies is actually taking b1 anemia can keep your pulse rate high
so that would be a lack of b12 or a lack of iron number nine this is called this autonomium this
is a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system controls
the pulse rate your heart rate and a lot of other things and too much stress will cause dysfunction
of your autonomic nervous system the best remedy for that would be right here b1 another symptom
of dysautonomia would be if you were to stand up too quickly and feel a little dizzy or disoriented
all right number 10 excessive amount of exercise this happened to me when i worked out twice in a
given day and i just got my pulse rate up too high and it just did not come down too well
so if your recovery is low or you overdo it your pulse rate could be too high being too acid
here's another example one day i drink some kombucha tea i didn't just drink a little bit
hydrate the whole bottle which actually switched my ph to being slightly too acidic and my pulse
rate was just way too high and i couldn't sleep that night so too much acid will increase your
pulse rate and it affects your breathing as well all right number 12 if your blood sugars are too
high or too low your pulse rate can go too high and so if you have any of these obviously it's
pretty self-explanatory what you need to do there are some other things you can do if you
catch yourself in the middle of night with your pulse rate high and you need to go back to sleep
this is what i would recommend there's a simple breathing exercise where you just control your
breathing in and out very slowly at a count of four to five seconds in and four to five seconds
out and so as you're controlling your breath slowly in and slowly out that will actually
start to affect your autonomic nervous system and your pulse rate should come down so it's something
that you can do to help you control the heart all right number two celery maybe you need to get out
of bed and just consume some celery celery has all sorts of great wonderful things vital nutrients
certain types of certain types of minerals that are really calming to the nervous system as well
as the blood pressure and i think the number one cause of a higher pulse rate especially something
that's waking you up out of bed would be that your carbs are just too high so you want to go low carb
and you want to go no sugar now when you initially get on a ketogenic plan you may find your pulse
rate goes up when you're in this transition phase for about three days but if you just
take potassium and a good electrolyte powder and you take uh vitamin b1 through nutritional yeast
that should pretty much prevent that from happening so stress can actually
raise your pulse rate so during the day you want to do long walks to keep the stress
off your body as much as possible i do walking every single day i think yesterday i walked for
an hour it's very therapeutic get in nature and just do the walks that's very good for the heart
and the last thing is to avoid emf i will be doing more videos on this but these are certain
frequencies or energies that emanate from your cell phone electrical wires so if you're sleeping
and your cell phone or ipad is right next to you right by your head or you have a lot of
electrical devices plugged in unplug them before you go to bed put your cell phone on airplane mode
and you're going to find that you'll have less emf what you have to realize is these frequencies have
a serious influence over your own frequencies you have a lot of electrical things going on in the
heart and different fields of energy and so you want to keep these to a minimum all right guys
there we have it now you know exactly what to do before you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

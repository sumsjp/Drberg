so let's talk about the best way to get rid of nausea
what is nausea well it's not a disease it's a symptom it's an uneasiness or a
discomfort that is nonspecific it's very difficult to tell where it's coming from
you just feel nauseous the symptom of nauseousness always has a cause it could
be motion sickness food poisoning chemotherapy low blood sugar certain
medications or drugs kidney stone can cause that symptom as well
being pregnant can definitely cause that in fact a very large percentage of women
who are pregnant experienced that symptom GI problems can definitely make
you nauseous but from my experience the number one cause of nausea is this right
here the gallbladder if someone ever came to my office while I was in
practice and had this complaint I would simply ask them two simple questions
when did it start exactly and they said yesterday I would say okay what time
four o'clock then I would say what happened and they would usually say I
ate something I said what do you eat six doughnuts okay well now we know what
caused that symptom and of course I would just tell them to avoid it and you
would be shocked to find out how they thought that was so amazing that I
figured it out you ate some donuts and you got this symptom but these are the
two questions that you can ask yourself and usually if these are not involved
it's gonna be related to your gallbladder or the bile duct that is
associated with the gallbladder so if you're eating something you shouldn't be
eating you need to avoid that if you're eating something that you should be
eating let's see you're on the keto plan and you're doing a lot of fatty foods
then you just need to decrease it but there's a few things in addition to that
you can do to actually help with this symptom
ginger either in a tea or a supplement is very effective peppermint
a tea or a supplement could help you cayenne pepper and a supplement can help
as well and chamomile tea is another really good one and lastly meadowsweet
tea which happens to have a natural version of the
chemical that's an aspirin but in very very small amounts but this seems to
really help with this symptom as well there you have it and I actually did
create another interesting video on the digestive system that I think you would
find very beneficial if you have this symptom too you can check it out right

i wanted to share with you what to do if
you sprain your ankle especially if you
sprain your ankle in the past and you're
dealing with problems later in life okay
what can you do about this you'd be
surprised on how many people have ankle
pain foot pain knee pain and even low
back pain from an old ankle sprain the
most common type of ankle sprain is
where the outer part or lateral part of
your ankle becomes inverted and so when
you roll your ankle inward you
traumatize the ligaments on the outside
now of course if you fracture the
lateral part of your ankle or one of the
ligaments are completely tore
this technique is not for you this is
for the person who sprained the ankle
and nothing is actually tore now
initially when you sprain your ankle you
should ice it immobilize it but after
about 48 hours you want to definitely
start putting motion into the ankle
because the scar tissue is going to set
in and then you're going to start
developing stiffness there's a lot of
compensation that happens when you
sprain your ankle because when you walk
you have the opposite leg it has to pick
up the slack and it develops all sorts
of problems in your calf on the opposite
side and your your thigh on the opposite
side so here's what you're going to do
and i'm going to demonstrate this on an
actual person number one stretch the
same ankle that you sprained okay into
the opposite direction it was injured so
if you sprained it this way you're gonna
you're gonna be stretching it in the
opposite direction okay number two
you're going to stimulate or massage the
opposite ankle the mirror image so if
you if you injure the ligaments on the
outside of your right ankle you're going
to stimulate through massage the
outside ligaments on the good side okay
on the left ankle if it was in the right
ankle you stimulate the left ankle
exactly where you were injured all right
number three you're going to work on the
opposite calf and outer thigh now what
do i mean
work on i mean massage because of the
compensation especially if this is
chronic and it's an old injury so you're
going to be working on the calf on the
opposite side the muscles all the way
down to the achilles tendon i'll show
you as well as the thigh primarily the
outside of the thigh on the opposite leg
that was basically taking up all the
slack okay so
so this ankle has been strained and it's
been strained for how many years
three years okay so you
you came down and it went this way okay
so this way right here so
the best
thing to do for this ankle
is to do the opposite motion where we're
taking it this way right here we're
going to just take the ankle and do in
the opposite direction like that now
does that give you any relief does that
make it feel a little better yeah
yeah so so what we'll do is we're going
to
if he actually went this way
we go the opposite way so this stretch
right here and you milk it
and it's going to give them the most
relief it's going to send signals to get
more circulation
into the opposite side through here
okay and if you want to get rid of pain
if there's pain in here you're going to
work on the other ankle
on the opposite side where the the
mirror image side so
if it hurts
on the outside here
you work on the
the other ankle on the mirror image and
you'll just press around
the bottom part of that bone those three
ligaments
are and you'll just kind of find the
point that's really tender is it did i
find it yeah yeah i found it so i'm
going to press
on the good ankle right underneath
this um
it's called the distal lateral malleolus
not that you need to know that but right
through in here we come up there and we
just
really work that out
and
stimulate this this is actually going to
force blood flow
into the other side it's going to give
the person a lot of relief so i'm going
to massage that doesn't matter kind of
like any pattern just
whatever you just stimulate it
and the key is finding the exact point
that's very very tender
is that it right there yeah right
through and there i'm not flipping you
off here so now what happened is after
three years of
limping on the leg
on this side this side has taken over
and has
built up a lot of
tension because of the compensation so
you have to work on the calf on this
side so we're going to work on the calf
and massage
the bottom
of the calf and strip it all the way
down
and you're going to work on that
every day and it's going to hurt uh he's
in pain right now i'm going kind of
light but you work out these muscle
spasms
right through and here
all the way down to the achilles tendon
it's going to give the person so much
relief now you know
i'm not even focused on the area that he
had a sprained ankle
i'm focusing on the opposite side
so you don't want to work too much on
the side where he injured himself you
work on the compensation part and then
we go right up to the leg
this muscle right here vastus lateralis
this is the one that's been compensating
for the ankle
so we'd also want to work on this point
right here
and on the outside here and there
probably is going to be some tenderness
through here
right there right
all through here
and uh i can see through his eyes
bulging out this is very tender he's
probably never ever had this
work down through here
and you just work this out you can use a
massage tool
the end of a brush
or
you can roll on a foam roller
to break up these adhesions
all the way down here
and that's going to give him tremendous
relief on the opposite side
so just go ahead and stand up right here
and tell me how
this foot feels now
just kind of see if it feels any
different
lighter yeah a little bit
yeah okay now
i'm going to show you a bonus technique
we're going to adjust his ankles okay so
what you do is you have the ankle right
here
and you have to put your knee
over
right through in here okay
and then what i'm going to do is i'm
going to take my hands
right here
and put it over the knee
and i'm going to lift up
and traction up
okay
and i'm gonna go forward did you feel
that yeah
so you hear these clunking
oh
wow that was a good one
so you do that several times you're
breaking up the adhesions on the ankles
so you lift up and [ __ ] down
let's lift up
down this way
okay and then i can do the other side
right here too
up down
okay
lift up and then [ __ ] down okay that's
how you adjust the ankle
so here we have the outside of the
fibula right through in here and then
the tibia is right here so this is a
stabilizer muscle and you have three
ligaments that come to this bone right
here the calcaneus your heel okay
and so the most
common injuries are the
where this
foot rolls inward the right here okay it
rolls inward and so you stand up tearing
or creating a sprain on these little
ligaments right here it doesn't
necessarily have to be ruptured or tore
but it could be bruised or or
traumatized and then what happens these
heal with scar tissue so it's very very
important to
do this correctly if it becomes a major
problem and it's not healing uh it could
be that this is fractured it could be
that those ligament is completely tore
or tore off the bone so obviously all
those are surgical procedures but if
it's not completely torn if it's just
traumatized you know you want to of
course use ice then you want to stress
in the opposite direction where you
actually have this ankle sprain so if
you sprain it this way you're going to
come outward right here that way you
have no way of traumatizing these ankle
this ligaments again
and you're just kind of you're you're
kind of creating an opposing force on
the opposite side it's going to make the
person feel good it'll increase
circulation and then the other point i
want to mention is that
it's important not to
limp
when you're walking after a sprain a lot
of people set up this
pattern of walking that creates this
asymmetrical
this kind of limping on the opposite
side letting the other
leg support it and so that creates all
sorts of muscle imbalances and and then
eventual knee problem on the opposite
side in the hip problem so if you can
stretch this and keep it in motion and
start to
gradually rehab it
make sure that when you walk you don't
walk with a limp try to walk as normal
as possible and that will set you up for
a really good recovery
now if you have not seen my video on
plantar fasciitis
that would be a good video to check out
right now

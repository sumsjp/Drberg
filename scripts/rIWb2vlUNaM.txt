hi guys we're going to talk about your urine color and what that means okay so
first of all I wanted to make a little disclaimer if you have any of
these conditions I'm not telling you had those for sure they're just clues
I'm not diagnosing you so get with your doctor if you have any issues with this
okay all right so the darker color urine normally urine should be like a straw
yellow if it's too dark it's too concentrated that means you do need to
drink more water okay if it's too clear if it's completely clear there's no
color that means is too diluted you're drinking too much water and when you're
doing that you're diluting the electrolytes and that's weakening the
heart so it's not it's that it's there's false information that states that oh
yeah everyone needs the clear urine that's not true okay bright yellow that
usually happens after consuming too many B vitamins your body is trying to get
rid of it especially since it's always synthetic vitamins it just goes right
through you it's not absorb so it's a good indication that you're taking
synthetic red dark red means you have blood in the urine now you could have a
kidney stone or like me about I'd say about six months ago one day I just
started peeing this red blood coming out and it freaked me out I was like what's
happening here do I have a kidney stone this is weird I'm eating good and
everything well it just happened to go for this this intense jog and it was
completely human and I was sweating and I pushed myself and I'm running hard
longer than I normally do and apparently I found out because I went to get it
checked there's no bacterial infection there's no kidney that pounding up and
down especially in certain high levels of heat even if you're doing marathons
you'll see that the kidneys will just like pound and see the urine is this
filtered blood through the kidneys so you're just taking the kid in your whip
lashing that thing all this Bloods gonna come right through unfiltered and that's
what it was because the next day I completely went away but got me freaked
out there for a second so then we have darker orange or brown that's
litora issue so you need to start going up with your vegetables at that point
and cut out the junk get the junk out of the trunk right pink could be your
eating beets or it could be a little blood yet a little kidney stone in which
case take potassium citrate and then green could be asparagus now if the
urine is foamy that's usually more protein in the urine that should be
there so your kidney is supposed to filter out that protein so it's either
you're consuming too much protein or the kidneys need some support so if that's
the case you might want to you know watch some videos and the kidney above
what what to do about that and then check with your dock as well but protein
usually is not a good thing and it can be serious so you want to get that
checked out but that's more of like a foaming situation but first make sure
that it's you know not something simple like you just ate a lot of protein and
then all of a sudden your body could have that protein so it's spilled off
into the urine all right thanks for watching I'll see you next video hey

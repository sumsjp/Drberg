so i was doing some research recently on the topic of autophagy
and i want to share with some interesting data um one of the biggest
benefits of doing a fast is autophagy
and so there's other benefits to anti-inflammatory
weight loss fat burning anti-aging and the list goes on and on
and it is true when you look at the actual definition of fasting
it's basically the absence of food you're not eating anything
you'll be drinking water but nothing else so let me just first explain
autophagy autophagy is a garbage disposal it is
breaking down stuff that shouldn't be there
things that are toxic and turning all that into brand new
building blocks to make new tissue so it's very anti-aging
and it also helps a lot of different conditions especially inflammatory
conditions neurodegenerative conditions heart
problems alzheimer's parkinson's anything
inflammatory so autophagy is a very therapeutic thing and one of
the biggest triggers is when you do fasting for a period of
time if you're consuming plants that are rich
in phytochemicals that will enhance your autophagy it will
not inhibit your autophagy so we have the
phytochemical curcumin from turmeric which is a spice and then
we have resveratrol which yes it's in red wine
but the wine will definitely block autophagy because of the alcohol
or you can get it from another supplement called knockweed extract
which is very very powerful then you have sulforaphane which is a
very powerful phytonutrient which is in cruciferous vegetables it's
a type of a larger category called glucosinolates there's
probably more research on this phytonutrient than any other
phytonutrients out there when you're consuming raw cruciferous
vegetables you are triggering autophagy if we take the
autophagy benefits from both fasting and phytonutrients
in cruciferous vegetables and add the additional anti-cancer benefits
it's going to help you remove more damaged proteins from the body
one type of protein that is toxic on your body is the accumulation of
misfolded protein or glycated protein which is a
combination of sugar and protein together realize i'm
not talking about your muscle protein or your ligament protein
i'm talking about the tiny biological machines that are doing all the work in
the body most of them are enzymes they're made
out of protein and when they get misfolded or glycated
they accumulate and they clog things up in your brain
they're involved in a lot of neurodegenerative diseases they're
definitely involved in cancer autophagy gets rid of this stuff it
increases stress resistance so your body actually can
tolerate more stress especially if you're going through
chemotherapy for example and you choose to do
chemo let's say with a fast and cruciferous the autophagy effect
will increase the resistance to chemotherapy
even the chemo and the radiation will have a less negative effect on your
cells autophagy also helps you stabilize genes
and by getting rid of the damaged cells you're left with
functional cells which will also decrease your risk for cancer
overall it will extend your life i recommend that you experiment with this
you can do like for example broccoli sprouts
or cauliflower or kale during a fast and just evaluate your results you can
get it as a food or as a food concentrate in a supplement
and lastly i just want to mention when you see the research on fasting
you'll usually also see fasting or calorie restrictive diets right well
cruciferous vegetables have extremely low calories
and their nutrient dense especially with the phytonutrients
i challenge you to experiment with this and type your results down below
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up

so if you have trouble consuming nuts this video is for you whether you're consuming
almonds pecans brazil nuts so a lot of people get this bloating and they're not sure why well
nuts have more phytic acid than even grains or legumes but what is this thing called phytic acid
phytic acid is something that a seed uses to help bind minerals and prevent biochemical reactions
to allow this seed to sprout so phytic acid is kind of a chemical to keep things locked up and
when you consume seeds with phytic acid you are not only creating a problem in the absorption
of calcium iron magnesium zinc copper but also because some of those minerals are used in enzymes
overall when you consume nuts you can't utilize a lot of these enzymes to help you digest them
so it's a situation where you're consuming a food without the enzymes and so it tends to sit
in the stomach create all sorts of bloating create irritation and even inflammation
so the worst nut that has the highest phytic acid is almonds it is 9.4 percent phytic acid
walnuts are six point seven percent phytic acid and brazil nuts are six point three percent now if
you compare these two grains grains are actually a lot less but there's a very simple solution
to phytic acid all you have to do is mimic the normal sprouting process or germination process
that naturally occurs when you plant a seed and to do that you just soak them in water overnight
that will start the process going the phytic acid will be released
this whole binding process between minerals will go away so you can actually absorb these minerals
and now this nut is going to be much easier to digest now the problem is you can have
this silky soggy wet nut so you're gonna have to dry it out and the best way to do that is
either put it in the oven at a very low temperature or a dehydrator for a period of time
until it's dry but what you're going to find is when you germinate nuts and seeds and dry them out
the taste is much better the nutrition is way way better and they're just much easier to digest so

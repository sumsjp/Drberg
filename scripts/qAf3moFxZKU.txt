you know what's really interesting is that heart disease starts when you're really young like i'm
talking seven years old it's incredible they have found lesions in the aorta in virtually a hundred
percent of children between the ages of seven and nine so i wanted to do this video to increase your
awareness on how early this condition actually starts and also to understand the cascade effect
uh from very very early stages into later stages because you don't want to wait until you have
heart attack symptoms you want to understand the mechanism you don't want to wait till you have
calcium building up an artery or some type of clot to then make a change in your life there's
a test a very important test i highly recommend everyone get it it's called a cac test it stands
for coronary artery calcification test and it doesn't take that long it's not very expensive
but it measures calcium in your arteries and it's one of the best predictors of mortality
so definitely get that test and i'll put a link down below for more information
also on a video showing my test results but you want the results to be zero you don't want any
calcium in your arteries because that already tells us that you've had inflammation you had
oxidative stress you had breakdown of the smooth muscle and that's been going on a long time so
let's talk about the cascade of effect and what happens first second third and fourth the very
start of heart disease starts with something called oxidative stress and this is a situation
where you have an imbalance of too much oxidation versus not enough antioxidants to protect you
from the oxidation if that occurs if it's out of balance you have oxidative stress and what
oxidative stress does it's very similar to rusting out your car you're starting to get a breakdown in
the surface and that's what happens in the smooth muscle either on the inner part of the artery
or the next layer deep it's called necrosis okay you're getting a breakdown of those cells
caused by oxidation then the body starts turning on all its different wound healing
mechanisms and you get inflammation and you get the immune system coming in with macrophages
start cleaning up the damage and as part of the band-aid you get micro-calcification tiny amounts
of calcium that are coming in there to act as a kind of a band-aid so the cell walls get thicker
you start getting more calcification you get more fibrosis that's uh the protein that lays down
with cholesterol and that's what makes up plaque so plaque is basically a band-aid so
the most important thing to know of this cascade effect is about oxidation and what really causes
oxidation higher levels of glucose in the blood is probably the the number one cause
of oxidation so you must reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your body okay that's number one
and also the omega-6 fatty acids very inflammatory there's been a big push in the last 20-30 years to
replace the saturated fats with unsaturated fats unfortunately that led to a lot more omega-6 fatty
acids which creates a lot of oxidation in center arteries inside our organs in the eye so number
one as a preventative thing you want to cut those out of your diet number two you want to start
increasing your antioxidants where those come from well plant foods cruciferous other healthy foods
but your own body makes antioxidants it has networks of antioxidants and it needs certain
trace minerals to make these antioxidants like selenium and zinc and so on and so forth
the most important vitamin for the inside of your arteries as an antioxidant is vitamin e
if you have any weakness or a history of having a lot of oxidative foods you should probably start
taking vitamin e in the form of tocotrienols and it works like 50 times stronger than
tocopherols and it can go into your arteries and start to really protect you the next thing
to focus on is fasting fasting helps to heal the inside of the arteries and it can also help build
up the natural antioxidant networks of the body so fasting is one of the best things you can do
to help reverse heart disease and there's another thing you can get ordering on amazon or some other
place it's called edta this is a chelator and it helps to pull out excess calcium from the arteries
i did a video on this very very powerful there's a certain method or way that you would take it
because it's going to pull out other minerals you'd want to put back the minerals that you want
and allow this product to take out the minerals that you don't want but it's a great chelator
it's great for circulation and many other things number five having enough potassium in the diet
very very important because if you're low on potassium which many people are because they don't
eat a lot of salad your body will start to pull in more calcium deposits okay i did a whole video
on that i'll put a link down below but potassium will keep your arteries very elastic very flexible
and they can prevent the buildup of calcium in your arteries and lastly vitamin k2 now this is
rare but it can happen where people can start building up not just calcium in the arteries
but actual bone in the arteries and that's because they're missing vitamin k2 vitamin k2
keeps the calcium in your bone and it keeps the calcium and the calcium formation
from occurring in your arteries all right thanks for watching i will see you in the next video
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

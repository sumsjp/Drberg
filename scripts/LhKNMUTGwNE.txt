so today we're going to talk about the worst type of fasting that you could do
there's actually two different uh patterns i want to touch on
the first one is the alternate day fasting
where you fast for one day and the next day you pretty much eat whatever you
want and there's also a modified version of
that on the day that you're fasting you're actually consuming about 500
calories then you have what's called the five and
two where you're eating whatever you want for five days and then for two days
you're gonna fast but this program also allows you to have about 500 calories in
the days that you're fasting so it's not a true fast and the
question is why are these two patterns of fasting
bad and not recommended well it's because of this
it takes three to seven days for you to get into
ketosis okay i mean like really get into it where you're about 80
to 90 percent burning ketones and doing it one day is just not enough
time to get into ketosis with this one you're pretty much eating
whatever you want for five days and then two days out of the week you're doing
fasting and of course if you're doing 500 calories you're not really fasting
you're just doing a low calorie diet you're not going to be able to generate
enough ketones for your brain to actually feel good
so you're going to be miserable you're going to be hungry
you're definitely going to have cravings to carbs
and you're going to be grouchy all the time and you're probably going to give
up and then say that it didn't work when in
fact it would work if you did maybe 18 and 6
where you're fasting for 18 hours and then you have a six hour
window of eating so let's say at 12 o'clock noon you had
your first meal and then at six o'clock at night you had
your second meal this would give you 18 hours of fasting
and you would really benefit from this because your hunger would go away
you wouldn't crave anything and your mood would be great you would not be
grouching a slightly better fasting pattern if you
can do it which you may need to work up to it would be 20 and four
so you're fasting for 20 hours and you have a four hour window
and this is pretty much what i do my first meal is about three in the
afternoon and the second meal is at about seven
that gives me 20 hours of fasting and this produces
some seriously good benefits especially
getting rid of your hunger in fact even before my first meal
there's absolutely no hunger involved in fact it
feels like i just ate because i'm living off my own fat
i have absolutely zero cravings and i am definitely not grouchy you can
ask my wife there's actually two important takeaways
from this not only knowing this information right
here but also this information right here all
it takes is a small amount of carbs to knock you out of ketosis for a good
amount of time so if you were to consume for example a
sandwich or a glass of wine that amount of
carbohydrate could knock you out of ketosis
for literally 48 hours if you want to avoid being miserable doing your fasting
just avoid these two methods i put up the right method
right here if you want to check it out

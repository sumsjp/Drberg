so it's not the virus that kills you it's actually your own immune system
let's talk about that so the virus doesn't have a metabolism it's not even
alive how can something not alive actually kill you well what happens is
this you have this inactive shell with some DNA material in there that has very
specific instructions to replicate because there's certain things on the
surface of that virus that connect to certain tissues and certain receptors in
your cell like a lock and a key now COVID-19 connects to what's called
the ACE 2 receptor in your cells and then they're able to get into the cell
once they're inside the cell your immune system doesn't see them so their goal is
to get into the cell as fast as possible and start to replicate and it hijacks
your copy machine your machinery your metabolism to replicate so that's
actually creating a lot of damage and then it creates this immune reaction
however that's not what kills you what kills you is this take a look at this we
have two parts of the immune system we have the innate which is the system that
doesn't need to be trained it's the first line of defense and then we have
the special forces called the adapted part of the immune system so if we think
about a worst case scenario you're in intensive care you're on a respirator
you're getting a lot of inflammation going on in lung it's called a cytokine
storm which is a condition where your lungs are on fire there's inflammation
going on there's a lot of oxidation there's a lot of free radical damage and
it's creating a massive destruction which then creates bleeding and fibrosis
and scar tissue where you eventually just stop breathing
also this destructive inflammatory condition is happening on the inside of
your arteries and it can even create blood clots you might want to look at
this as an overreacting immune system but in reality it's really not because
this part of the immune system is only overreacting because part of this system
is not working so you have what's called the T suppressor cells these cells
suppress or regulate the over reaction one of the purposes is to prevent too
much inflammation they basically are the fire department that floods the water to
put out the fire they also prevent autoimmune diseases but this is your car
this would be the brake pad and this is the accelerator so we have this severe
imbalance where we lose this and then we have too much of this and that's really
what's killing people the virus is a trigger and it's definitely causing a
damage in this area but you have to realize that the virus really only kills
people with a weak immune system and it's usually certain metabolic
conditions that are causing a weakness within these specific cells right here
now in the HIV virus that targets what's called the T helper cell this cell is
like the quarterback within the entire immune system and it just will knock
this guy right out and now there's actually no control you have no more
immune system and that's how someone would die other strategies will block
your vitamin D levels and if you don't have enough vitamin D
these cells can't work and you can't put out the fire this is why vitamin D is
very anti-inflammatory not having enough vitamin D can create this imbalance
certain viruses can create this imbalance having a pre-existing health
issue can create this imbalance as well so you put all these things together and
you're really at risk from having problems but you have to realize it's
not the virus itself that is creating this it's a lot of other things that are
going on at the same time now one of the defense mechanisms that your immune
system has is creating a fever because creating a fever decreases the duration
of infections in fact it increases your chances of living because it slows down
the viral replication but if your immune system is weak guess what you may not
even have a fever not having a fever yet having an infection means that your
immune system is broken also having a preexisting health problem you already
are going into this condition with low amounts of antioxidants the problem with
that is that this overreaction is creating so much inflammation so much
oxidation so many free radicals if we don't have the antioxidants to counter
that that's when people start dying this whole video is really about emphasizing
the importance of your immune system because if your immune system is strong
this virus really does not play a big threat especially if you understand how
to strengthen it but if you want information on that I put the video up
right here check it out

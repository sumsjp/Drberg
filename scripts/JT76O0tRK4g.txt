hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're gonna talk about the seven foods that
will help you sleep at night okay not just sleep but actually get to sleep faster right number one
celery why because celery has a certain chemical in it that lowers blood pressure and affects the
central nervous system and it's a calming thing so if you were to consume three celery stalks
it would really relax the body so let's number one number two it's cheese now cheese in general
has a really good source of calcium and calcium relaxes the muscles and the nervous system is
one of the electrolytes very important I like doing cheese versus taking a calcium pill most
people taking calcium carbonate that's the wrong type of calcium next one is Rena purse now what's
unique about peppers it's one of the highest vitamin C foods that you can eat and vitamin
c increases oxygen in your blood and if you're low in vitamin c your tissues don't get oxygen
one of the symptoms is going up by the stairs and getting out of breath really fast that's
a vitamin C deficiency vitamin C deficiency is create fatigue you know this just labored
breathing so this will increase the oxygen it's vitamin C is also good for the adrenals
now number four is outside of integral and this helps oxygen from a pH angle so if your pH is off
typically too alkaline to excessively alkaline and I know some people are going to go wait a
second I thought we're supposed to be alkaline well I'm talking on the scale it's excessively
alkaline especially two things will do it one is a lot of carbs and stress will do it so upset a
vinegar helps to bring you in the right pH it really will help your oxygen levels next one is
molasses I don't recommend molasses if you're trying to lose weight but if you're not trying
to lose weight it's it's amazing substance that has a lot of potassium there's a lot of
magnesium and a lot of calcium and ice let it has a lot of iron so all the key electrolyte
it's and all these minerals are physiological tranquilizers they calm the nervous system next
one is almonds almonds are loaded with magnesium magnesium is a key mineral that not only puts the
heart in rhythm but it helps the muscles in the nervous system relax and the last one is a large
quantity of salads or vegetables every single day now this is something that a lot of times
people have a hard time doing because they're not used to that much vegetable but if you look
at the requirement per tab potassium you need about 4700 milligrams every single day so that
would be in between 7 and 10 cups of vegetables every single day so that's good not that's not
just going to give you potassium it will give you a lot of other minerals including magnesium so
again magnesium potassium our physiological tranquilizers if you don't consume enough
potassium the heart will work harder and you hear that little pounding thing on the pillow at night
when you're trying to sleep that's a potassium deficiency especially if you're doing too much
of the wrong foods like too much protein and on the potassium you're not going to sleep that night
all right so in the next video we're going to talk about the foods to avoid I'll see you then

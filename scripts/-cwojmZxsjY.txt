hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about a huge myth out
there that says that your brain only can run on glucose that's a myth
it is not true if that was true how do you explain the people that cut out
glucose from the diet and they do fine after weeks and weeks and weeks you only
have 72 hours to run your body to run on sugar before it gets tapped out because
glycogen which is stored sugar in your muscle in your liver it only has like a
72 hour window and then it's depleted unless you put it back in so what's
happening with that how do you explain that well it's because your body
converts over to another fuel source when you deplete the glucose okay or
sugar and it actually runs on something called ketones now what is a ketone a
ketone is a fuel source or a fuel a byproduct of consuming more fat or even
protein but you have to keep the sugars out of the diet to do that and keep your
high carbohydrates kind of low and then your body is then switching over to
burning fat okay burning fat is actually a healthier
thing than burning sugar for the brain especially there's been a lot of studies
I'm going to put some of a lemon below that you can see the relationship
between burning your bum going into ketosis which is fat burning and
actually improving dimension or even Alzheimer's yeah because what happens
when your body runs on sugar and you become more of a diabetic or a
pre-diabetic called insulin resistance you can actually develop something
called beta amyloid z' what does that mean
those are something a plaque that accumulates in Alzheimer's patients and
even in dementia it's kind of a plaquing and there's a huge link between that
plaque and insulin so I believe and this is my opinion that Alzheimer's and
dementia niz insulin related it's connected it's not just associated it's
probably cause and effect it's called diabetes type three that would explain a
lot of the diabetics that start having dementia nor pre-diabetics that have
dementia memory loss so what I'm telling you is that when you run your body on
ketones it's a much more efficient fuel source for your
brain better energy for the brain less highs and lows with blood sugars which
is kind of a dirty fuel so when you run your body and sugar you actually get low
blood sugar and you feel kind of irritable and then you get high blood
sugar and you get tired you have to take a nap
but when you're running your body's on budyonny ketones you've become a lot
more energetic now the difference between ketosis and ketoacidosis are two
completely different things ketoacidosis is a is a pathology it's a
disease state from diabetes because of diabetes you lose control with insulin
and you get this pH problem you come very very acidic and you have a lot of
side effects that is very different than just regular ketosis doing it on your
own without diabetes okay because when you eliminate the carbohydrate your body
switches over actually the cells build new machines to switch over to burn
ketones instead of glucose that's a healthy state that is not the same as
ketoacidosis so you have to differentiate those two also people say
well oh you're going to get bad breath you're going to get constipation kidney
stones not if you're consuming enough vegetable okay so we're not just talking
about eating all this fat and protein we're talking about some fat some
protein no carbs or you get vegetable carbs we want a lot of vegetables like
seven to ten cups of vegetable that provides all the potassium that provides
all the magnesium and the minerals to flush out the fat that keeps you clean
that prevents kidney stones it helps constipation so that is like to mop from
my viewpoint one of the best diets that you can do so and then people say well
you well in the medical literature it only says that you can burn glucose is
the only thing the brain runs on well how do you explain this thing called
gluconeogenesis okay glucose meaning glucose neo which means new
genesis which means making so your body has the capacity in the liver to
make new sugars out of protein and out of
okay so in your mind you don't have to just think I have to eat you know to get
my brain having glucose I don't just have to eat sugar you can actually have
protein and or fat to get your glucose in your brain so your your brain can run
on glucose and it can also run on glucose from fat and protein and ketones
so it has a lot of variability just during the survival development over
time your body your brain has the ability to switch over so here's the
thing people also afraid well if I'm eating all this fat I'm going to get
high cholesterol bla bla bla see fat is only bad if you add sugar to it
protein is only bad if you add sugar to it that's when you start having problems
did you realize that your body makes 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every
single day yeah look it up that's like four sticks of butter or 300 strips of
bacon or 14 eggs what happens when you eat more cholesterol foods your body
just makes less if you eat less cholesterol foods your body makes more
and all the sugar that people eat convert over into cholesterol that's
really what causes the problem okay so here's what I recommend don't don't
sweat this whole idea that your brain only needs glucose it could run on other
fuel sources and check out the links below and I will see you in the next
video

hey dr. Berg here in this short video I'm going to talk about a new test
that's being done in many scientific communities using hair analysis and what
they're doing is they're basically measuring a three-month exposure to
stress or cortisol exposure which is basically triggered by stress so you
could get this hair analysis and find out you know at what level of stress
that you are I'm going to be having my tests done as well but it measures three
months of systemic stress full-body stress certain universities are studying
the effect on cortisol in heart disease cardiovascular risk anxiety belly fat
abdominal fat blood sugar problems sleep cycles mineral metabolism collagen so it
affects a lot of things as stress wears out the body so it is one of the best
biomarkers body markers for stress and how your body is adapting to it so if
you're interested in getting a hair analysis I have some kits I can send to
you there's two places in the country actually there's one out of the country
one in the country that you can get this done I found a less expensive one and
I'm going to test it out and then we'll look at the results but I'm going to
show you how to take a hair sample so let's let's do that part next I'm going
to have Roxana help me on that one okay so we're going to show you how to
get a sample of hair if you want to send it out for the cortisol testing and
again you just need a hundred hairs just a little bit and so just don't take too
much off because I just want to send it out and then we'll they're going to
grind up the hair and then analyze it okay so just take a little spot off the
back part just cut off a little bit now I'm going to be the first guinea pig
okay and so that's that way you can what the heck oh my gosh

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about a hidden cause of some stress that
you might have and has to do with watching too much of the news especially before bed
but it's not necessarily just on the news it could be on YouTube it could be in the
newspaper because what happens is the news will fixate your attention on fear so it's
constantly shocking the body watch this watch this danger don't go outside hide under your
bed not good for the adrenal glands because it's constantly triggering adrenal stress
more and more and more so and I know this might be hard to believe but some news stations might
distort the truth just slightly I know it's hard to believe so here's what I want you to
do I want you to do an experiment I want you to for one week just avoid watching the news go into
a park like this and just see how you feel all right thanks for watching hey guys thank you so
much for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video

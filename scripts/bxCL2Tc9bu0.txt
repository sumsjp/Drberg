good morning everyone i am back with a new guest
and today we have dr chris kenobi he's a clinical associate professor
at university of texas southwestern medical center and he actually is a
doctor ophthalmology so he he's an eye physician and eye surgeon so
welcome doc i'm so happy that you're able to make it
thank you dr eric it's great to be here thanks for the opportunity
well you know the reason i bring you on is number one um
i wanted you to speak at our upcoming summit for sure
but your data is fascinating i uh you cover a point that um is just
rarely talked about but it's probably one of the most
important things out there that i think people need to talk you know emphasize
and understand and i know you're going to get into it
and so i have a bunch of questions for you so
i just want to dive right in uh you're a doctor
of the eye so you you basically see things
from a certain viewpoint and i want to know a little bit about
how you got interested in
the diet connection and how that related because you really talk about the
vegetable oils and the impact of vegetable oils on the
your eye but how did you stumble on this well uh yeah first first of all
i definitely stumbled into it and uh to be honest with you and the
audience is that i wouldn't be here today if it weren't
for my own suffering with arthritis that's how it
all started eric uh was i'd suffered with arthritis for
16 years and just in a nutshell i kind of went
partial paleo and in about 10 days my arthritis
improved about 80 that was back in 2011. wow and eric it was
so phenomenally uh life altering to me after all this suffering
i had had and after seeing so many of my physician colleagues to try to help me
and a dietary change which nobody had suggested
made that kind of change for me it just it just uh instilled a desire in me
to want to know more and then the more i started digging into this the more
interested i became and and that just kind of
ballooned and really i guess if you want the rest of the back story
it's that that was 2011 and in 2013 i came across
the research of weston a price and are your is your audience
quite familiar with price's work most of them are
um absolutely so yeah i think so okay so so just very briefly
um weston price uh did phenomenal research in the 1930s
where he evaluated people all over the world on five
continents as they transitioned from native traditional diets over to
westernized diets and westernized diets essentially contained refined white
flours added sugars vegetable oils
trans fats canned goods sweets confectionary
in essence processed foods and price noted how those foods
drove westernized disease that started with
dental decay and then was followed by arthritis and cancers and
all kinds of degenerative disease and so that was 2013 for me eric
and later that year as i continued to study
it just suddenly hit me in late 2013 that after i had understood that
westernized processed foods are driving heart disease cancers strokes
hypertension type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome
obesity autoimmune diseases when i understood
all that finally it hit me and i thought could processed
foods be driving age-related macular degeneration amd
which is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss
and blindness in people over the age of 65
worldwide and uh this is something that you know i had
dealt with in the clinic for 24 years at that point
and in any case so then i followed down that path and i continued
and to investigate that while i was in
practice for about the next year and a half
and in early 2015 i felt i had enough evidence and i was convinced that i was
on the right path although i couldn't bear i knew i had
needed a ton of study and some more you know fundamental
research and i left practice to pursue that
so so a question about where did you personally have
arthritis was it all over your body was it in your back where was it
yeah so it when i was about 34 years old um it you know it started mostly in my
knees and i had a lot of trouble with my knees
in my mid to late 30s and then
and then it i think next it kind of hit my
elbows and then my shoulders and then my neck and then eventually my
fingers my toes pretty soon i was riddled with arthritis and i was 50
years old at in 2011 and
eric i was in severe pain and i i've always been
athletic and i got into where i just it was so hard for me to even just jog
or warm up to lift weights uh it was just i just you know
was on a disastrous path wow it sounds like we go ahead well i was
given uh an immunosuppressant which i took for
one day and the next day i heard about the paleo
diet and started like i said kind of a
makeshift paleo because i wasn't convinced i was
very skeptical everything i'd done for 16 years with my
arthritis was a you know a fail and those but that was
all drugs wow like i said i've probably seen a
dozen of my physician colleagues and um i don't want to make this all
about my arthritis but nevertheless i mean none of them had ever said
one thing about diet it was always a drug an injection
steroids you know all that fascinating i think we have i think we have
something in common because when i was 28 i had the ex
similar thing i started noticing arthritis in my hands
all down my back my spine i told my wife i'm like what the heck is going on
yeah i'm in my 20s and i got arthritis and so i had it a little bit earlier
than you but i know exactly what you're talking about i'm
going everywhere trying to help at that time i lived in san diego
um and i actually stumbled uh price and pottinger had a whole center
there and that's where i got introduced to them
as well which is interesting so i started turning things around but
um getting back to the macula okay what is the macula of the eye
so the macula is the central retina it accounts for about the central 10
degrees of vision and it is responsible for
you being able to see somebody's face to read words on a page to see a stop sign
it's it is your central vision and if that part of the retina
degenerates then your vision will begin to decline
and macular degeneration is probably for ophthalmologists today it's
probably uh second only to cataracts in terms of
what uh ophthalmologists deal with at optometrists too
in westernized countries and so yeah so this disease
um it'll it gradually steals your vision typically and then it can progress to a
wet stage which can be severe and um
let me just tell you that today this year
they estimate that 196 million people are affected with macular
degeneration in the world and of those by some estimates the world
health organizations data would suggest that as of 2006 and
that's the latest data i have for blindness
the bilateral blindness probably around 3.15 million people in the world
bilaterally blind meaning both eyes centrally blind they can't see
their their their they can't see their spouse's face
their grandchildren's face they can't see to drive or
read and if you think about that that is a staggering number of people it may
be more than that so it could be approaching the population of the state
of colorado where i live today in the world all
blind you know from this disease and and you
know when i first investigated this eric what i saw i had to go back and
look at all the history and this i couldn't find anybody who any
research that had done this and what i found
was that in a nutshell that between 1851 when mac
when the when the retina was first visible
uh because of the invention of the ophthalmoscope and then over the next 80
years up until about 1930 there was no more than about 50 cases
of macular degeneration in all the world's literature
and ophthalmologists were using the ophthalmoscope
and recording images and diagrams in the 1850s
and so i go i go through that data but in a nutshell
you know what i found was that this disease was extraordinarily rare
and it changed as our diet changed and the the big picture
here everybody uh if you don't already know
this is that we didn't have any man-made
processed foods in the world with the exception of sugar
up until 1866 approximately so we had very small
quantities of sugar processed foods again being sugar
refined flours vegetable oils and trans fats and in 18
right after the american civil war 1866 is when we first got
vegetable oils we got refined white wheat flour in 1880
because of roller mill technology which is another
refined nutrient deficient food and then in 1911 we got trans fats and if you put
those four foods together that makes up
processed food it's so incredibly simple but those four
things now uh big food manufacturers make 500
some thousand foods out of those today and those
first of all are severely nutrient deficient and then they are toxic
and here's what what i will submit to you
is that almost all of these chronic diseases
are driven by nutrient deficiency and toxicity and they
all come from these foods the foods are nutrient deficient those four processed
foods and then they have toxicity related
primarily to vegetable oils trans fats and and
probably the and the fructose component of sugar if
the dose is right well you know you know i um if you take
a look at each one of those individually i looked at the
consumption i think before 1970 i just looked at 1970 to now
and we have a trend going up with refined grains we have a
trend in going up with sugar but what i didn't understand until i looked at your
stuff is that there is a massive spike i think
it's 4x with vegetable oils i mean that's the thing that
really took off and you know we're all emphasizing avoid
sugar well yeah we know that but there's not enough emphasis about
avoiding the vegetable fats and understanding what they can do
not just to your eye but their whole body they can cause insulin resistance
just like sugar um and i guess these that's the way that
they're processed is just completely and utterly um
barbaric i mean it's like white i mean they're heating it and then they're
there's there's nothing left i mean and they're very inflammatory so
so when you look at when you look at the macula and you're trying to evaluate
what's going on with someone's vision and let's say it's just starting to
become a problem would it and they're just would they
notice like oh i'm not seeing that well and that could be other that could be
maybe the eyeball's not shaped correctly maybe the lens is not correct
or it could be the macula is the symptom of lack of eyesight very similar
to all four of those causes or are they or is it a different thing where you're
the central part of your eye you can't see because the macula
handles so there's blurry in like a little circle when you look or
how would you differentiate macular versus just the shape of the eyeball is
is not right as far as vision goes yeah good question
so first of all you uh may not have any symptoms in the early
stages of macular degeneration in fact you probably won't recognize
anything and the the symptoms of any decrease in
vision you would never be able to distinguish
on your own from cataract or from refractive error you
know being nearsighted or asymmetric or farsighted or whatever
or maybe even glaucoma you're not going to be able to distinguish
anything yourself and you should never rely on your own
perception of your vision you need to see
an ophthalmologist or an optometrist to be evaluated
and have you know have your retina evaluated
everybody should start doing this in their 40s for sure
and every you know two to three years i won't get into all the detail but
people need to have their eyes examined eric in order to
evaluate for that but the symptoms are similar
oh they yeah you the the majority of people that in the early stages of
macular degeneration they're not going to have any clue at all that they have
this disease and of course this would be the best time
i mean of course you want to try to prevent all of these diseases
and the best way to do that the only way to do that is through
diet and um you know but but if you have it already the best
thing to do is is you know see an ophthalmologist
optometrist have a diagnosis and then you would make the same exact
changes to your diet in order to prevent progression of the disease that you
would in order to prevent it it's the same exact exact thing so when
you look at the macula and you're diagnosing
what is what's what are you seeing is it uh
extra blood vessels or is there you can you see like this destruction is there
plaquing like what what's happening in the macula that's
causing this this what does this degeneration look like
well uh you know the best thing would be to
have a uh an image of that but you know because
none of our audience is really going to hardly know what the retina looks like
but you see these little you know whitish yellow dots called
druzen and you see something called pigmentary disturbance
which is is something that is affecting the
retinal pigment epithelium beneath the you know
beneath the retina proper and those that's the first stage and that that's
that's the uh dry macular degeneration and if it progresses eric which about 15
10 to 15 percent of the people that have dry macular degeneration will progress
into the wet stage and this is a stage where the vessels can grow up underneath
the retina leak fluid and bleed and that that is
devastating to the vision and um and the calc can be treated but
i don't know that we should get into that at all but yeah i was just
kind of curious about the effects of um like this vegetable oils is it as an
oxidative inflammatory free radical thing that's
creating that damage or is it similar to diabetes where
you're creating um destruction of the blood
vessels to the eye through the retina itself i
don't know but it just i'm just curious from my own
viewpoint yeah you know um i eric i almost have to
uh giggle when people ask me you know during the
like a podcast or whatever you know what is the
what is the tell me what the um the cause of this is at the molecular
level or tell me what is the mechanism right you know i
was thinking the other day i should say okay let me
summarize 32 500 scientific papers that have been published on this in the last
four decades because that's basically about what there is
i mean there's an extraordinary amount you know of evidence here to try to
you know put into a nutshell but let me just say that here
here's what i would submit as a big picture is is that vegetable oils
are they have four main problems and this is going to apply to
macular degeneration heart disease atherosclerosis
stroke type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome
obesity alzheimer's parkinson's autoimmune okay these the main things
is that vegetable oils are going to are first going to be nutrient deficient
because they don't have any vitamins a d and k2
none in any oil even the really good oils like
a good coconut oil no none of those vitamins right
yeah they're you know this puts you at risk for nutrient deficiencies and
vitamins a d and k 2 create an amazing
synchrony and synergy that drives health and so this is what you know
weston price began to show us back in the 1930s i mean did an incredible job
with this all right so that's the first thing you
don't so when you used to plant and replace the healthy animal fats
lard butter beef tallow you know eggs organ meat fish eggs
all these kinds of things that are that are rich in these
fat soluble vitamins a d and k two we used to plant those
with vegetable oils now you're nutrient deficient that's problem number one
problem number two you're you're going down a pro
oxidative pathway and eric i cannot tell you how important
i have i've learned so much i've learned over the past few
years that tells me this is the most important
thing of all on a mechanistic uh level is the pro-oxidative effect
okay so so that drives oxidation i can come back and
review that in some detail third pro-inflammatory
so the the omega-6 seed oils are pro-inflammatory
gonna lead you down an inflammatory path and then finally
they're toxic and i don't use this term toxic loosely
what i mean is is they are poisonous and they're poisonous
because the seed oils can they contain and or in our own
bodies will produce uh toxic aldehydes for one thing but
these toxic aldehydic end products which are things
like 4-hydroxynonenol which is 4h and e malone dialdehyde or mda
9 and 13 hoed which is hydroxy octadeca dianoic acid carboxyethylpyrol and
acrylene these are just five but there's hundreds of these toxic
aldehydes that are connected with all of these diseases so collectively
those things right there are cytotoxic meaning directly toxic to cells
genotoxic you know toxic to the genes mutagenic carcinogenic
atherogenic atherosclerosis inducing thrombogenic clot inducing and
obesogenic and on top of all that you know we have
if you look at the whole picture you know the
seed oils are driving you know if you look at this big picture
one of the first things they do is they drive they they damage the mitochondria
and the first thing that happens at the mitochondrial level is you become
insulin resistant at the cellular level and this is where i'm seeing insulin
resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction and the mitochondria are the powerhouses
of the cell for those who don't know that's where 90
of our energy is produced and seed oils severely damage the
mitochondria through these oxidative effects and you begin to
lose energy and the cell begins to become dysfunctional
and or dies and now what what i understand and what you know people
understand is that that work on this all the time
is that mitochondrial dysfunction is a part of
all of these chronic diseases it's you know heart disease congestive heart
failure atherosclerosis cancers macular degeneration type 2
diabetes metabolic syndrome if i didn't say it yet
obesity all these disorders are connected through mitochondrial
dysfunction why would they all have this and the reason i'll do is oxidative
stress and where does oxidative stress come
come from primarily seed oils now
what about someone sitting back watching this and says well i don't use
corn oil i don't use vegetable oil i don't use crisco so i'm good like i
they don't have the awareness of how insidious this problem is i mean it's in
i don't know how many foods i i think i read on your website there
is uh an average person consumes seven what 700 calories of this stuff
per day in their diet without even knowing it is
is that am i exaggerating or no no that's exactly right let's see so
it was 80 grams a day uh of the average person in 2010
and that's we did this research and i can go back and get
give you the big picture but in 2010 the average american was consuming 80 grams
of vegetable oil a day well you know oils fats are nine calories of
grams that's 720 calories and that is 32.5
of u.s consumption literally a third of our diet is coming out of factories i
mean ivor cummins calls these factory fats and kate shanahan who
studied studied this for 25 years
you know she says nature doesn't make bad fats
factories do and i think that's a powerful message
because these oils they're not natural you know they're they're uh they're
heated they're chemically treated they're
alkalinized bleached and deodorized all chemically and heated about four or
five times and by the time they hit this bottle and you've got this nice pretty
looking kind of slightly yellow uh um
oil it looks great but that is a that's a that's a bottle of poison and
because it's extremely oxidized it contains all these toxic aldehydes
and when you consume it it will accumulate in your body
but if i go back here eric so if so i i did this analysis this this will be
coming out in our next published paper i'm working on with a
bunch of other ophthalmologists and vision scientists
but but i did an analysis to look at
what our omega-6 linoleic acid that's the main
fatty acid in seed oils what our consumption of that fatty acid
would have been in 1865 before the world had any of these vegetable oils
and it was 2.2 grams so so we got seed oils by 1866
well by 1909 we were already at 4.84 grams
by 1999 we were at 18 grams a day and by 2008
we are at 29 grams a day okay now let me give you the
percentages so in 1865 before the world had any
vegetable oils um our in the us for example that 2.2 grams of
omega-6 linoleic acid that is about one percent
of our caloric consumption by 1909 we're at two
percent of caloric consumption by 1999 we're at
um sorry here i could try to remember the
numbers um
ah i went blank it's uh oh seven percent there we go
i have there seven percent of caloric consumption
and by 2008 11.8 percent just rounded off
12 of caloric consumption okay now like a spike
yeah so people will say well we need you know
little like out there you need omega-6 and omega-3 and you do
they're essential fats you have to have linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid
which is the comparable omega-3 but guess how
much you need 0.5 percent of your diet needs to be
omega-6 linoleic acid point five percent that's the essential half of a
one percent yeah and and so in other words so we
went from um you know what right well let me just
put it to in 2008 we are consuming
24 fold more omega-6 linoleic acid
than what we actually need to be consuming
you know i just if you look at all these you know native
traditional populations which i've done and
i'll go through when we do we do the keto summit i'll hit some of those
but i've i've looked at all these and all of them their omegas okay none of
them have any vegetable oils because if you
have vegetable oils you're already consuming a processed
food diet you're already westernized but all these native traditional
populations who don't have sugars white flowers seed oils or trans
fats all of their own the highest omega 6
like i have found is still under 2 percent the the
the uh the messiah of kenya and tanzania they consume 66 animal fat
which is 33 to 45 saturated fat but they're omega-6
i mean with all that fat 66 of their diet being animal fat
their omega-6 was still 1.7 well the omega-6 in you know westernized
diets all around the world today is around 8
to 12 or higher and what's happening
the whole world is getting overweight obese and sick sicker than dogs
and it's and and this problem is you know i i i was thinking that
the problem is far worse in developed nations but guess what
the the world health organization shows us that
developing nations 69 of the deaths in developing nations
in recent years are from chronic disease these same things heart disease cancers
strokes hypertension type 2 diabetes you know all that and guess what so so
let me give you one more statistic between 1963 and 2003
in developed nations vegetable oils doubled on average uh
kaiser did this work um so 40-year period they doubled in
developed nations but in developing nations
vegetable oils tripled in that same period of time in that 40-year period
and in developing nations their sugar consumption is
really low i mean it's the world health organization says don't consume more
than 10 percent of your calories as sugar i think that's very good
but get you know what they were in developing nations during that period
19 from well from 1964 to 1994 i believe it was
their consumption of sugar in developing nations on average was around
6 to seven percent sugar they're probably it's not sugar
driving i mean why are all those people in developing nations
why are they all getting these diseases at as much or higher rate than we
are right because of vegetable oils vegetable oils have gone everywhere that
you know every just like western price showed in the 30s if you could
find if you could get to a place by roads you know by
a port or roads processed foods were there
you know the big food manufacturers were selling their food and there's just
a few isolated places in the world where people aren't consuming these foods
what is the um i know if it's the usda or whatever
but aren't they recommending that we consume more vegetable oils
than saturated fats that's been the push right
i don't know about the usda eric but i can tell you this
um the so you know sally fallon from the western area price foundation calls
the these organizations the diet dictocrats
and and she's talking about the harvard school of public health and i'm
not you know this is not about harvard it's about the harvard
school of public health and then the nutrition department of
tufts university also in boston the nutrition department of mayo clinic
the american heart association and there's a bunch of others
they're all collectively telling us vegetable oils are healthy
omega-6 is healthy and so people are so confused because i mean
if harvard tells you it's healthy who are you to believe
right and um but you know you this is why this is one of the reasons i think
people like you and me and you know chris masterjohn
and chris cresser and joe mercola you know get into this is
because you know most of us from our own
suffering and you start going i gotta figure this out because
i can't trust the diet dictocrats to tell me what's right
why do they tell us this eric there's only one reason they tell us vegetable
oils are healthy one reason as far as i know and it's
because vegetable oils make your cholesterol go
down so if you believe that cholesterol is the problem in heart
disease you might buy this argument and that is
such a massive fallacy as you know that it's
not about cholesterol it's about uh you know it's not about ldl it's
about oxidized ldl when we talk about and all that where does oxidized ldl
come from it comes from the exact same thing
vegetable oils and sugar possible you know to a lesser degree but vegetable
oils are driving oxidized ldl and
oxidized ldl drives atherosclerosis drives coronary
heart disease and you know ivor cummins has showed us that
you know i mean he's brought our attention to the fact these studies have
shown for example that um the greater your oxidized ldl
the greater your heart disease on a coronary artery calcium scan which
is the gold standard for evaluating heart disease i mean i've
nice i had mine it was zero two probably would have been a lot higher before
and i know you'll get more into this in the summit but um
these vegetables also have a half-life of i think one to two years and
they make up your cell membranes they go into the body
and they um if your body's made of these oils
it's a lot different structurally and it's going to affect you on a whole
different level probably stiffening of the arteries who knows what else
i mean it's just crazy yeah so if okay if you
eat you eat sugar today if i eat a cup of sugar today i can
either store it as glycogen in my liver and muscles or i if there's
if there's if i've consumed enough calories i'm going to convert it
mostly into monounsaturated and saturated fat right
that's what it's going to be stored as but if you consume polyunsaturated fats
your body these omega-6 oils we're talking about
and omega-3 too your body was not it was designed to get these in really
tiny quantities because we weren't designed to ever have vegetable
oils in our diets and so your body stores these omega-6 and omega-3s
preferentially and it doesn't want to burn them bait
oxidize them for fuel i mean that doesn't work well we could
talk about that but anyway so yes you store them and they get stored
in your fat and they get stored in your cellular
membranes and they get stored in your mitochondrial membranes where
they create all this havoc and the thing is is they store at
approximately your as an approximate
level whatever you're consuming in your diet your adipose tissue will be
approximately twice as high in this omega-6 so if you
consume one percent of your diet as omega-6
you'll probably be no more than three to four percent
i said roughly okay you know with your in in your omega-6 in your fat
but if you consume 10 or 12 percent of your diet as omega-6
you will be at about 20 some percent in your fat so stefan gnay
showed this data just brilliant stuff in 19
he looked at 37 studies that looked at the linoleic
acid in our body fat in americans body fat just americans
37 studies and collated all this data graphed it
so 1959 the average linoleic acid omega-6 in americans fat was
uh 9.1 9.1 now remember obesity in 1960 was 13
percent in the u.s 2008 um
linoleic acid in americans fat averaged 21 and a half percent what was obesity
in 2008 i think it was around 32 something like that and um
all of these diseases have tracked accordingly so
so this is what we see is the more of these you consume the more they're
stored in your fat and they stay there okay oh and back to
your your question how long are they in your fat well this is the really bad
news this is where you have to pay for your nutritional sins
and i hate this but the the half-life shown in studies and there's been
multiple studies that have looked at this but the half-life
of these omega-6 fats in your fat is 600 to 680 days you might as well
round it off to around two uh two years now the you know the
in pharmacology what we learn is it takes about five
half-lives to get rid of a substance like a drug from your body
now nobody knows if that's applies exactly to linoleic
acid but as a rough estimate then that means that
it's probably gonna it's gonna take a few years maybe up to even eight or ten
years once you get all these out of your diet
you get your omega-6 really low to get your
omega-6 in your fat down down to really low level like it should be but you know
what in three days of go of getting vegetable
oils out of your diet your inflammation markers will go down
your pro-oxidative status will go down your toxicity from the aldehydes
will go down guess what you'll have far less risk
uh you i believe of heart attack and stroke
in three days wow you know this uh if if you're watching and you're
wondering what oils we're talking about we're
talking about soy corn canola cotton seed
probably some other ones as well like um safflower sunflower
maybe even peanut oil i don't know peanut oil yes
all of those yeah so i'll say them too it's
soybean corn canola cottonseed rapeseed grape seed sunflower safflower
and rice bran those are the biggies there's a few others
and but those are the big ones so you know if you just want to stick
get we got to get the big picture right first and that's just just
get those out of your diet yeah start reading labels too
that's in the salad dressing oh send me mayonnaise you can't find
a salad dressing without it i mean it's difficult so
it's almost impossible and i wouldn't you know even a salad
this is where you know sally fallon says where's the best place to start she says
it's with your salad dressing because they're all made
with these vegetable oils and you probably you and your audience
probably both know this eric but you can't trust olive oil in the united
states 79 of it is adulterated with these
vegetable oils and why is that it's because um even
olive oil and we can talk about olive oil uh i'm
not the biggest fan partly for this reason
but there it's being adulterated so greatly that you you know 80
essentially of the olive oils in the us you can't trust because they're
adulterated with all these cheap just you know horrible oils
and why is that because it's very profitable olive oil good
extra virgin olive oil that's properly prepared and maintained and all that is
expensive the seed oils are dirt cheap
um in 2000 uh as recently as 2014 one on the world's market
one kilogram of the vegetable of these vegetable oils
on average was one u.s dollar oh well come on 80 grams a day
of that you know in the american diet works out to be about
8 cents i think it is and as low as for soybean oil as low as 5.6 cents
so in other words so here's the thing is you can take
let's say you want to make pop tarts as a big food manufacturer
you can take you know 5.6 cents or 8 cents worth of
of these oils you can take two cents worth of refined wheat flour and
two cents worth of sugar and you can make pop-tarts
and sell them for four dollars and so most of the money goes into the
marketing not into the product right the box and so so and and so
getting back to your you know question and statement about these are
in all the foods well guess what everything you almost all the processed
foods you look out you know they're made uh primarily of
these four things you know i mean you just put them together just look at
every label and you find out most of them are going to be made from
refined flours sugars and seed oils it's got any of those oils you know i
wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole and be really
careful about olive oil i wouldn't trust most of it
that's a sad fact i do think that olive oil can be
okay i don't trust it i am and i'm a little bit
skeptical quite frankly about the the polyunsaturated
left fat in even in olive oil for most americans who are already have
a lot of omega-6 in their own fat it's too high i would get it out i
i just cook everything in butter we just stick with
uh pasture-raised butter um to cook everything in i just don't trust
oils quite frankly i don't trust any of them for the
most part i think coconut oil is probably the
safest one on the market um even coconut oil doesn't give you vitamins a
d and k2 not like you know like butter wood
i mean butter a good pasture-raised butter is going to give you all of those
yeah exactly so this brings me to my i'll have a lot of questions but i have
to withhold myself because um we're going to talk you're going to
talk about a lot of this at the summit but there's um
gosh there's well let me just quickly answer you just ask two last questions
okay when you um consume
mineral oil for example i know for a fact that
pulls out of your liver and your body um a lot of fat soluble vitamins because
it's an oil and it just kind of depletes you i know when you
when someone exposes itself to mineral oil they end up with a deficiency of
vitamin a vitamin d etc so my thought was when you mentioned refined oils
just like refined sugar they'll deplete you not just the vitamins but the fat
soluble vitamins so i'm guessing that's probably why because there's
they're like like a vacuum there's no vitamins in there and they're just going
to suck out some of the which is in your liver i
would imagine that's one question well
i'm sorry well first of all i don't know what mineral oil
is i have to people take it as a laxative
yeah but what's it what does it come from i mean does it come from different
sources or what is it coming from eric i think honestly i think it's some type of
it might be some type of petroleum product i i'll have to find out the
exact ingredients but it's a really refined
empty oil that people use as a laxative and i actually don't even know for sure
but i'll have to find out okay i guess i've never thought about it
and this is what you know every once in a while somebody throws a
question at me i just go like a guy asked me about emu
oil the other day and i'm i don't i don't know you know but there's some
principles there that i could get to but i'll have to look in you know about
mineral oil i just don't i don't really know
what its source is or what it's made of uh yeah
and so okay um so i don't really have an answer for that
at all totally fine if i don't know the answer i'll just tell you
i'm i'm trying to learn i learn from people
every day um about about this and i don't care
who i learn it from i'm just i'm just trying to learn like
like you and everybody else right me too uh and then the other question is uh
side question um so you have all these people
that have fatty livers and there's quite a few of them
i mean if you have a gut you have a fatty liver and
they're they're doing the vegetable oils they have insulin resistance they're
doing sugar and um what happens is that um
the vegetable oils really can disrupt the
production of bile in your liver and the release of bile i know that even
when i was in practice for 29 years you the the damage that these vegetable oils
do to your bile ducts in the liver as far as they become bile deficient
they can't release and a lot of that bile starts
backing up into the liver and it starts to create fibrosis and
scar tissue so there's really a lot of um you know
not just gall stones but just the congested
colostasis where you have this uh this stagnant
bile that's just clogging everything up but what's
interesting the treatment for that um is bile salts and what's interesting
about that is that there seems to be a really interesting
connection between taking that improving eye
vision there's a vision component to taking
bio salts that i've looked at and the reason i'm bringing up is because you're
an ophthalmologist i don't know if you've ever
looked at that connection but i noticed when i used to put my patients on
bile salts they would their vision would just
really improve greatly and either the mechanism it triggers the
vitamin a receptor in the eye because i know it's an analog or it just
might help you drain all the liver so you can
start to have the liver function again but
there's an interesting connection between
the vision and your liver in biles i don't know if you ever looked at that or
had experience with that i just wanted to bring it up as a side note
yeah no you well first of all uh here again you've
taken me completely off guard and i'm uh i didn't i don't know that
much about uh the liver disease
uh i do know i mean with regard to bile and bile function and how bile
salts my my first reaction is is that
if we're um vegetable oils are reducing our
ability to first of all absorb vitamin a and they're oh not only that they're
vitamin a deficient but they're affecting our vitamin a
absorption and i'm thinking that you know perhaps
the bile salts then are improving vitamin a
uh absorption perhaps and uh well i'm just i'm honestly just
guessing here eric no that sounds screw it you know
with the with what i do know i may be off base here
and i don't mind saying yeah i mean i may be
uh i may be off base here but um but you know some of my recent work you
know what i for example with the eye and this
applies to the whole body the world is vitamin a deficient
but it's just as rampant if not more so than vit i think
it's more rampant than vitamin d deficiency and
probably everybody who's looked at this at all
realizes that vitamin d deficiency is extraordinary
in this world today and both deficiencies are connected with almost
any chronic disease you can name there are inverse
relationships between vitamin d and vitamin a uh
and virtually every chronic disease there is in other words as the chronic
disease prevalence goes up the vitamin vitamin a and vitamin d
deficient or levels go down in other words more vitamin deficiency
more disease and and then you know k2 comes in
in there as well but k2 is even much harder to
as far as i know to measure and analyze um but but you know vitamin d is easy to
measure and um you know supposedly treat that
and that's another entire topic but i think okay
but anyway i'm thinking that you know this this could go back to
it goes back to vitamin a uh absorption perhaps
yeah that makes that makes sense well anyway i just
really appreciate your attention your time to do this and uh
um for everyone that is on um we're he's gonna be on the the next
summit at the end of august so i hope you guys um can show up
because it's gonna be an amazing presentation and you'll be able to
deliver the full rundown on what you've been studying i'm really excited to to
see that as well so thank you and we'll be seeing you in
august at the end of august and i'll put the
link down below for more information as well as your website and your
information you have a foundation as well as a lot of great data on
macular uh degeneration and i'll put all that
down below as well awesome right yeah just so
if i could say the it's uh i i work for cure amd
foundation it's at cureamd.org we are a 501c3 nonprofit
and uh so nobody in our organization including me
um is compensated for anything we do uh for this our goal is to help people
and to prevent vision loss uh through ancestral diets and uh we're
fortunate we've now reached we think people with macular degeneration over a
million people wow but we want to reach the world so
yeah we will hope i want to thank you eric and thank all of your audience for
watching and help spread the news because you know
this is a grassroots movement we've all got to do we're all in this together
the way i see it we can't do this without
people spreading the news because that's right that that's
that's where it's at well i'm glad i stumbled on you so that's great thank
you so much thank you so much eric

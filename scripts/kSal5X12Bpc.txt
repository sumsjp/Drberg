I had some questions about stomach acid and mineral absorption if apple cider
vinegar was the best thing to take if you want to improve mineral absorption
so I wanted to create a video just on this one topic and yes it can help you
but I need to explain a couple little points about this so normally in your
stomach you have a very very acidic acid called hydrochloric acid the pH should
be between one and three now think about it neutral is seven so every number that
goes below seven you go seven six five four three two one is 10 times as acid
so if we compare six to seven six would be 10 times more acid five would be 10
times more acid than 6 so it compounds so when you get down to these lower
numbers you have a very very acidic acid and this is normal
there's three main things that your stomach acid is supposed to do number
one it's supposed to help you break down protein okay so if you don't have the
acid you can't break down the protein it starts to putrefy
you get undigested protein number two it helps kill pathogens from invading the
body so if you eat food with some microbes guess what that stomach is
there to kill off the pathogens and if you can't kill them off they can invade
the body and you can create all sorts of infections in the colon it's kind of
part of the immune system and number three and this is the topic that we're
discussing now it helps mineral absorption so having
the right amount of acid in your stomach can make minerals more bioavailable if
you don't have enough stomach acid then the absorption of calcium iron magnesium
zinc copper cobalt and other minerals won't be as efficient you also won't
have a hundred percent absorption of folic acid vitamin C vitamin D and
vitamin A so basically we need this strong acid or stomach to actually
absorb these nutrients as we age we lose the strength of this acid and
start having deficiencies of these nutrients so aging is a very common
cause of not having enough strong acid in your stomach other causes are
antacids if you're taking antacids or if you have hypothyroidism or if you have
pernicious anemia which is an autoimmune disease of certain cells in your stomach
or if you have the infection Hpylori that can do it or if you had gastric
bypass which is a surgery that can affect the pH of your stomach
now there's two conditions one is achlorhydria which is zero stomach acid you
have no more stomach acid and then another condition hypochlorhydria
which is a deficiency of that strong acid in your stomach both of these
conditions will affect the absorption of minerals and this can also create a
problem with SIBO which is a condition where your microbes are growing in the
small intestine instead the large intestine and this can affect your
absorption of nutrients because these microbes are eating your nutrients and
starving you of the nutrients now the question is can apple cider vinegar fix
low stomach acid and the answer is it can help absorption of food and has a
lot of other benefits but it doesn't necessarily fix hydrochloric acid itself
it will help the absorption even in the small intestine of nutrients and it
actually can help to inhibit some of the microbes growing in the small intestine
so it has a lot of benefits but to build up hydrochloric acid there's several
other nutrients that you're going to need number one you're gonna have to
find the cause of it for example if it's age well you can't do anything about
that right but if you're taking any antacids you might want to find the cause
of that get with your doctor and see if you can actually reduce that because the
more you're on this it's gonna be very difficult to correct this this
hydrochloric acid is made from chlorides as in hydrochloric acid and sodium and
potassium and zinc and iodine so you want to make sure that you have all of
these in your diet another good remedy
to help build this up would be something called betaine hydrochloride okay so the
chlorides can actually help build up hydrochloric acid but apple cider
vinegar can help in digestion but it's not the main thing to correct a low
hydrochloric acid situation so anyway I just wanted to give you a summary on
answering this question and I've also put some really important videos on
hydrochloric acid on this page thanks for watching

i wanted to find out um what mainstream medicine thought about the relationship between
your diet and ulcers so i looked it up and this is what they said the
diet does not play an important role in causing or preventing ulcers wow
that's interesting then what causes it it said h pylori nsaids which are pain pills stress and
alcohol and the reason why they said that diet does not play an important role is because
before we had medications for ulcers doctors use milk and milk wasn't very effective so therefore
diet doesn't play an important role well i'm going to tell you that is false information
your diet does play a vital role in whether you get an ulcer or not because what they missed
in the causes is the biggest cause which is a zinc deficiency how does a person become deficient in
zinc well just do what i did in college eat a lot of refined grains okay pasta pizza muffins
cereals that's what i did and did i get an ulcer absolutely so these so-called healthy whole grains
actually have a lot of phytates in them that pull the zinc out okay so i got an ulcer and
it was so bad i mean i was up at night i had a lot of problems but of course i did not connect
the dots at that time this persisted for a long time i started taking medication for it
and um just went from bad to worse and what's interesting is one third of people who get
ulcers have absolutely no symptoms whatsoever so what i want to tell you is there's something that
you can do about this okay number one you have to fix your diet if you're new to my channel
click the diet down below what you need to be on okay but for some immediate help just start
taking zinc the type of zinc you need to be taking is zinc carnosine okay i'm not going to get into
brands but just find a good brand that has good reviews number two you need to do intermittent
fasting very important to heal this ulcer number three cabbage juice is a very effective remedy
and number four chlorophyll as in wheatgrass juice powder or other types of chlorophyll
it's great to heal the inside of your digestive tract but the most important thing is the zinc
why because if your body is more deficient in zinc you're going to make more gastric juices
and acid secretions you're going to pump up more pepsin which is an enzyme that can dissolve the
inside of your stomach and also you're not going to make enough mast cells and mast cells help you
regulate the inner lining of your stomach which is all about supporting the integrity of the mucosal
barrier in your stomach not to mention zinc will improve the immunity especially if you're fighting
h pylori hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

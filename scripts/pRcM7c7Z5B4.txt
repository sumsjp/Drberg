hey guys it's dr. Berg here in this video I want to ask you a question
do you realize an average American drinks 50 gallons of poison every single
year yeah check this out table sugar converts to glucose and
fructose two different types of sugar glucose and fructose the difference is
simply the shape of that molecule that's it very very similar but just slightly
different shape but the way the body processes these sugars are completely
different in other words glucose is processed by all of the cells your cells
can metabolize and use that sugar it does affect insulin as well so insulin
comes in and lowers the sugar so your whole body is used to glucose but as far
as fructose goes no not one cell in your body can metabolize fructose so what
happens it ends up in the liver as the last resort and it's treated like a
poison okay so so the body has to get rid of it so what does it do it converts
it into fat deposits around the liver around the heart around the organs and
that's what's really behind the fatty liver so you might think well a fatty
liver only comes from drinking alcohol no it can come from consuming fructose
causes insulin resistance because that's in the liver so it messes up the
receptors for insulin because your body is trying to reject it and block it and
block this poison by downgrading the receptors so it doesn't get in anymore
so that's diabetes so get diabetes bad cholesterol if I deliver high blood
pressure floow2 tension inflammation liver
cirrhosis because the scar tissue and inflammation that occurs so it's really
a bad deal but if you actually listen to even some of the like the American
Dietetic Association they say that there's no difference between fruit and
fructose it's both the same sugar is sugar
that's not true in fruit which our bodies weren't designed to consume very
much anyway maybe seasonal seasonal when they're in when it's ripe but let me ask
you this could you actually consume 10 apples or 20 apples no because the fiber
in the fruit stops the consumption of it plus you have all the enzymes in there
and you have the nutrients as well so it's not the same as just pure fructose
that we're making from high fructose corn syrup
so yes corn is so-called natural but the way that we're consuming it is not
natural it's not meant to drink our corn sugar or our fruit sugar so it creates a
serious situation on the liver and that's actually happened to me as well
growing up I had so much sugar and I'm still paying the price for that so if I
were to go back in time I would have made sure especially all my kids in the
very beginning that no sodas no juice what you should do is you could take a
carbonated water and take liquid flavored stevia
okay put ten drops or five drops in this carbon water it makes the greatest soda
no sugar tastes great your kids won't tell the difference okay that's what you
need to have your kids consume versus the sugar and the sodas and definitely
like if you're going to a fast-food place do not consume that liquid drink
because most of that's high fructose corn syrup 60% of it so it's just it's a
cheap filler it subsidized subsidized by the government so it's just like that's
why they're doing it it makes more profit but it's not good for your liver
but an average person is consuming way way way too much there's also no
negative feedback so when you consume this drink
there's no turn off switch you can do a lot of fructose without being satisfied
so it's highly addictive so here you are something with something that's more
addictive than coke cocaine and you're basically consumed
this thing that's a really dangerous situation because you're going to crave
it and then you're going to drink it and there's no turn off switch so it's
highly addictive the way you're consuming it is not natural but even now
corn is so-called natural not to mention not going to even get into the GMO thing
with corn and soy but the problem is that our bodies do not process fructose
the way we do with glucose and it's a completely toxic poison to our bodies
and we're doing this huge experiment right now where we're putting more and
more into the food supply and people are buying it unknowingly not I mean not
just in the sodas it's in the foods it's in the cereal it's in the yogurt it's in
ice creams it's in a lot of different foods so you have to start reading
labels if it says I four just corn syrup or it says corn syrup which is the same
thing a lot of times because they just switch the definition I would not
consume it at all okay so go ahead and make the switch and start consuming more
the carbonated waters with the liquid stevia and stay away from this sugar
right here so I'll see you in the next video

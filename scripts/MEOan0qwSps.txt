hey guys I want to do a quick video on understanding net carbs in relationship
to a ketogenic diet for those people that are new to it let me just kind of explain what that means
net carbs because normally we recommend 20 to 50 grams per day of carbohydrate but its net carbs
okay not total carbs basically if you take the total carbs minus the fiber and equals the net
carbs that simple fiber typically has really no response with insulin so if there's in the US and
Canada the way they calculate the total carbs they will put in the fiber so you have to deduct it in
other countries in Europe and I think Australia they separate them out so you don't have to do
this calculation whatever you see is the total carb is the net carb but if you live in the US or
Canada you need to deduct the fibers to get the net carb which makes a big difference so let's
take a look let's say for example you have one cup of any one of these foods celery for example the
six celery total carbs is 3 grams right not much fiber is one point six so the net carb
is one point four grams so it's one and a half grams roughly which is so insignificant that's
never going to be an issue tomato 7 grams - 2.2 grams for the fiber equals four point eight grams
a little bit more but not too bad hummus 35 grams of total carbohydrate per cup - 15 grams of fiber
equals 20 grams of net carb of course I doubt if you're going to consume a cup of hummus but you
might but still you you would be within the normal range of definitely carbon you aid in a given day
an egg 0.6 grams of total carbs zero fiber equals 0.6 grams a net carb so it's basically a half a
gram that's hardly its insignificant pineapple 22 grams of total carbohydrates 2.3 grams of
fibre not very much so you've got 19 point 7 grams of net carb so always calculate in the
net carb not the total carb thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report

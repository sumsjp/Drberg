so i have a question for you what color is your phlegm now that's a very weird question
first of all what is phlegm well phlegm is mucus that is originating from your respiratory system
usually something from the lungs not necessarily from your sinuses and then when you cough it up
that's called sputum and your body actually makes about one liter of this phlegm every single day so
there's quite a bit that's being produced and then when you have an infection it can be a lot more
now let's just go through the different colors of phlegm just so you can get a ballpark idea of what
could be going on if the phlegm is white or clear that could indicate more allergies or asthma if
it's dark yellow that usually indicates a mild infection and if it's green it could be more
of a severe infection now if it's darker like like almost black that can be a fungal infection brown
phlegm could be more of a lung disease if it's gray that's usually because the person's a smoker
now if it's pink or red suspect blood and that could come from the nose coming down that could
be because the air is too dry or it could be a vitamin c deficiency where the capillaries are
fragile or it could be even a vitamin d deficiency now there is a rare chance that there could be a
lung cancer involved or it could indicate a tb infection so if it's a bacterial infection
usually it takes between 10 and 14 days if it's a viral infection it could take a little bit longer
but if you wanted to thin this mucus or phlegm and try to extract as much as possible there's three
remedies i'm going to recommend number one zinc at least 50 milligrams number two vitamin d at least
10,000 IUs of vitamin d3 and one of the best herbs to use in this situation is called fenugreek and
this can act as a very powerful expectorant to get rid of this mucus all right thanks for watching so

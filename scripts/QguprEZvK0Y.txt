today I'm going to talk about a very important topic and that is your own
immune system you may not realize this but your immune system is the most
kick-ass military that ever was to help you understand the immune system we're
gonna compare it to the US military and to do that I'm actually gonna bring on a
guest and his name is commander Dave Overcash he's been in the US Navy for 27
years he's retired now his 27 years of service included over 300 landings on
aircraft carriers five deployments to the Middle East
overseas tours in Hawaii Japan and South Korea and serviced at the Pentagon Dave
thanks for coming on thank you dr. Berg it's a pleasure to be here I look
forward to our discussion so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to make this
as simple as possible it's difficult because it's a complex subject but let
me just attempt to do that what is the immune system the immune
system is your defense system it's your military it's there to protect
you you have various barriers you have your skin the outside and you also have
the barrier of your internal skin in fact the internal skin of your body is
quite large in fact it covers 400 square meters that's the size of two tennis
courts so it's a tremendous amount of surface area and you have billions of
immune cells just beneath the surface guarding that wall waiting for an
invader or a pathogen viruses bacteria so that would be a front line of defense
so Dave give me a comparison of that to what the military has the formal
military term for that would be the four line of troops or the forward edge of
the battle space there's gonna be highly trained but not necessarily you know
very specialized troops but very large numbers of them in mechanized units I
might be a term some of your folks would be familiar with but you're those are
your general troops that are gonna be right up along the front that are gonna
be able to detect any movement in your adversaries and be able to be
the first line of defense against whatever comes against them so this
would also compare to something you would see at the airport you have metal
detectors you have all sorts of screening devices to weed out those bad
actors or people that potentially could carry a bomb on a plane when I was in
practice that I would do seminars in governmental agencies so I bought online
these those little credit card knifes right as a box cutter I thought they're
really cool they actually fold up the credit card so uh you know where this is
going I basically bought one put in my wall and I forgot about it and I
actually somehow took a flight and that wasn't even detected but then the next
week it was in my wallet I went to do one of my seminars had the governmental
agency in DC and so as I went through security
I just remembered as he was going in that I had that in my wallet and my
heart started to pound and all of a sudden but the little red light went off
they opened up the wallet and found this credit card knife and they called I
don't know what code code red or something they call people to shut down
the entire building and they pointed to me
and they put me on the wall put me in handcuffs and I said no no no you can
have it you can write so they took me to a room to wait for the FBI to come they
wanted to check me out just to make sure so I'm like I'm just here to do a
seminar what's happening and I mean unfortunately there's a huge line of
people and they're like they couldn't leave they couldn't get in everything
was frozen so I had to wait for some hours and so I'm sitting there handcuffs
and there's two military people guarded to sit there just guarding me and it was
apparently a room that they had some food in it and there was a cake and
they're talking about nutrition and I I just couldn't help myself
to speak up it just wasn't the best time to talk about you know car bhai
so I kind of quickly so then the middle of the FBI came and they just they said
what's your intent I said I just thought it was cool and I got in so they go yeah
this is kind of cool and so they escorted me to the car and
everyone was watching and I had to secure this weapon in the car so I can
go back and do my seminar presentation so this is another example how the
immune system would work it's constantly scanning for pathogens things that are
not itself and a very important part of immune system is to differentiate
between the good guys and the bad guys so the main players on the front line of
defense are the phagocytes okay these are cells that eat bacteria and viruses
and the top professional phagocyte is called a macrophage macrophage means big
cell that eats it's pretty much acts as a garbage disposal it eats up debris but
if there's an invader that macrophage will go in there and take it down and if
there's a lot of invaders it will hold the fort while it recruits back up so
this part of the immune system is called the innate which is part of the immune
system that doesn't need to Train any specialists you're pretty much born with
this these are general soldiers that have a nonspecific defense mechanism so
they can handle little stuff but when things get too crazy your body recruits
more specialists from this system right here this is called the adaptive immune
system or the acquired so then we have the neutrophil now when you get an
infection and you have mucus and pus 70% of that is made out of neutrophils
okay so neutrophils have three weapons they can eat microbes but they also
control chemicals as well as a net over the microbes and so the chemicals of the
use are hydrogen peroxide the active ingredient in Bleach so they use bleach
to kill these microbes as after they pulled them in what's interesting in the
military is there are certain types of chemical warfare that they use so Dave
why don't you give us a comparison on yeah there sure is there's chemical and
biological weapons that they're very effective and neutralizing an adversary
everything related to a chemical kind of attack slows you down and has a an
inordinate impact on you compared to normal conventional weapons I remember
when I went to basic training that was in 1983 I was in the military the army
reserved for five years I was a medic we had to go through this gas chamber and
of course they did not give us really toxic chemicals but they exposed us to
tear gas and that was a major thing for a lot of people including myself I can't
even imagine being exposed to something even stronger than that because that was
pretty strong so the neutrophil will also throw a net like spider-man on the
pathogen with chemicals to dissolve it you know your your example they're kind
of like wrapping up and then adding chemicals what it reminds me of is is
indirect fires that are used in the military where a let's say some troops
are on the ground and they need to call in artillery support or close air
support what they might do is term that that's used as maybe is bracketing you
know they'll call in a fire and they'll see where that bomb lands they'll see
where that show lands and then they'll adjust that fire and then when they get
it on to exactly where they want it they're gonna ask for maximum effect of
the available indirect fires and and then yeah they'll be able to take out
the adversary that way so we have the macrophage the neutrophil these are both
phagocytes then we have something over here called the natural killer cell so
one of the things that this cell does is it releases something called interferon
interferon comes from the word interfere because the function of interferon
interferes with viral reproduction so it stops the production of viruses which is
the virus weapon so it slows down the production of the enemy the leadership
of the and military realized we have to destroy
their means of replicating their capabilities and so the United States
ate their force in World War two based in England went after the entire German
industrial military-industrial complex they bombed every factory you could
possibly imagine destroying plants that produce tanks
plants have produced artillery pieces the plants have produced ball bearings
anything that would produce a mechanized piece of equipment so the idea was wow
we can't get rid of these folks fast enough for this equipment fast enough so
if we can prevent them from producing any more at least there's a finite
number of things that we have to destroy instead of an infinite all right we just
talked about the innate immune system now let's talk about the adaptive immune
system now the adaptive immune system is acquired in other words it learns from
experience in order for that part of the immune system to work correctly you need
to expose it to a pathogen or a germ so if someone lives in a sterilized
environment they never develop their immune system so it's very very
important understand that your immune system grows and becomes stronger
through training going through an infection overcoming it and now having
that memory of it so it's ready for the next time Dave give me an example how
important training is in the military you know our operations manuals people
say are written in blood right so all the mistakes that previous folks used
and either died or or crashed aircraft the lessons learned from those things
are then written in your operations manual so you don't make that same
mistake twice there's a lot of potential for problems
there and they came to pass in the Vietnam War there were three major
aircraft carrier fires hundreds of men were killed in fires that start that on
those aircraft carriers they had a very difficult
and stopping the fires once they began because of all those things that are on
the flight deck not everyone on the aircraft carrier was trained at the time
to fight fires and so they instituted a program where every single person that
goes on to a ship any ship has to go through significant firefighting
experience because they found that the initial wave of firefighters were killed
in trying to fight these fires and then there wasn't anybody trained to really
take out those fires once they began so yeah if you don't train you are damned
to continue having similar accidents over time so this part of the museum are
more specialists they're like the Special Forces they actually have very
specific actions that they are assigned to these guys are more general these
guys are more targeted
give us some examples of the different units or special forces that you have in
the military a lot of times we can't match the pure numbers that maybe the
adversary that we go against has but we need to have better training and so we
have a lot of Special Forces or Special Operations Forces in the military the
Navy SEALs Delta Force you know what we found is that like I think I can think
of a couple examples we what we found that even if our adversary say purchases
a very excellent piece of equipment we could beat that adversary with a lesser
capability if we have trained harder mmm and and that's why maybe we might not be
so afraid of a North Korean pilot with a great piece of equipment because he
doesn't train very much because their economy so poor they don't
have the resources to be able to train a lot and so he may be up there and a
great piece of equipment but he really doesn't know how to operate it he's not
proficient at ador or even say the Iranian Navy purchases a Russian
submarine that's not the same as a Russian submarine crew highly trained
operating a Russian piece of equipment the Iranians are gonna be as good at it
so we found that that training that exposure the more realistic the training
the better one one more example I give you is that in the Marines when they
have target practice they don't use automated targets they actually have
their the Marines will go behind a dirt berm and I believe they still do this
and pull the targets up and down so that they can hear the bullets going overhead
while the other Marines are conducting target practice that acclimates them
were to an environment where they might be in battle which makes them more
likely to be able to succeed when they are in that kind of environment so these
specialized immune cells they're called t-cells
stands for thymus basically get their training in the thymus gland which is
not the thyroid sounds similar and it's actually located lower than the thyroid
so the thyroids here thymus is right above the heart and what's interesting
is only 30% of those t-cells make it through this training the rest die off
so they're very selective and when you're born you have this huge thymus as
you get older it starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and stress will
shrink it a vitamin D deficiency will cause a shrinkage of the thymus gland so
nutrition is very very important keeping your thymus very strong in reality these
pathogens target different weaknesses within your immune system so if you have
a very strong immune system even though it might not be very large it could
handle a huge invasion of viruses or pathogens we have a lot of special
forces or special operations forces in the military some examples would be the
Navy SEALs maybe Green Berets Delta Force US Army Rangers the Air Force has
a group called the pair rescue men or PJs there's a pride the most well-known
that they're the most highly trained the the most specialized forces that we have
for very specific target sets one point I want to make is this when someone gets
an infection they have a cough or runny nose a fever some type of indicator that
there's a battle going on within your body the worst thing to do is to stop
that infection to suppress those symptoms because what's going to happen
is you're stopping the training of your t-cells you're cutting it short and when
you try to suppress the immune system the duration of infection goes longer
and longer so they have to work harder and harder so it's very very important
to enhance the immune system with diet nutrition keeping your stress low than
it is to quickly try to shut down those symptoms all right so we talked about
the three players under the innate there's actually four main players
within the adaptive immune system first one is the killer t-cell
now what these guys do is they have a chemical called perform which punches a
hole through the cell and then they release a chemical that causes the cell
to commit suicide for the greater good of the body so these cells that die for
the greater good to kill out that virus are are considered like hero cells Ujima
where there were a lot of Marines that would jump on grenades that that landed
near them and they're their buddies and they wanted to protect their friends and
a lot of examples also with with folks that are in the Medal of Honor which is
the highest medal of valor that's awarded in the military where they're
wounded they believe that but they're not going to make it and so they would
do something that was extraordinary or out of the ordinary where they would go
off by themselves to create some kind of a diversion that would allow the troops
a left behind to exploit you know the weakness that was made by that movement
but they knew that they were gonna die alright the next player is the T helper
cell so this cell is a very important self there's the main coordinator for
the entire battle going on so it's going to recruit backup it's going to
determine what players are involved what part of your military is gonna be used
at what volume what types of weapon tree Dave give me an example of what you'd
have in the military that compares to that oh absolutely that's that's a
commander at any level give some general direction about how he wants it done and
how often those things are going to happen you have to have somebody at the
top that's directing the overall movement and kind of sees the big
picture now one thing I want to mention about the tea house
CEL is that viruses have strategies to invade and take over the body and our
body has strategy is to kind of go back and forth so we have this battle back
and forth and if we take the HIV virus its strategy is to take down the T
helper cell if it succeeds in doing that because your immune system is weak the
entire immune system won't be able to work and that's why it's called in
immunodeficiency disease
so viruses are very intelligent they're gonna take down like the key player
involved in this battle now they've give me an example of
something in the military that is somewhat similar an individual at the
top is as the center of gravity the desert storm it was Saddam Hussein or
Iraqi Freedom Saddam Hussein and even when we attacked Afghanistan Osama bin
Laden so we're constantly going after the head and believing that if we take
out the head of the organization then the rest of the body or the rest of the
country will fall into disarray and it will there will be a better use of our
resources and make it easier for us to go in and the key to all of it is being
undetected because once an adversary knows what you're trying to do they can
build up their defenses and they can counter whatever it is that you're
trying to do I have a couple examples of some really damaging spies that we've
had over our time one her name was Ana Montes she was a spy for Cuba and the
Defense Intelligence Agency we we found that she did some amazing damage by her
time you know right in the middle of all the greatest intelligence that we had
about Cuba during the Cold War and then another one being Aldrich Ames who was a
KGB spy in the CIA for longest time we had no idea and he was he did some
extremely the damage from his passing of information that he was able to get
undetected was was really significant now one strategy that these viruses have
is they have the ability to go inside the cell and turn off your vitamin D
receptor this means that you can't absorb any more vitamin D apparently
they know the vitamin D is crucial for your immune system it is involved in
every single level and if you don't have enough vitamin D
then you can't turn off these huge what's called cytokine storms which is
an inflammatory condition that's out of control
it's an overactive immune system and that's really what's killing people in
this Cove in 1917 system and the enemy the virus and what their strategies are
so you can actually overcome it so since we're talking a little bit about
strategy there has been a person in history sunsoo that was a military
strategist and he wrote a book called the art of war and I happened to find a
book that was translated from original Mandarin Chinese this guy who was in the
Vietnam War got very interested in this book he spent six years learning
Mandarin Chinese and then translated word-for-word the entire text the
original translation of the title of Sun Tzu's book based on the author's
research was not the art of war it was the technology of war which is very
different technology means more of an exact science of how to do something
versus art implies adding your own creativity I want to give you just one
quote says this following this reasoning supreme skill is not 100 victories in
100 battles supreme skill is subduing the enemy's operations and its forces
without battle so if we take a look at that quote and compare it to the battle
that's going on between your immune system and a virus how would we subdue
the virus's operation well with the COVID-19 we know that that virus pretty much
only attacks someone with a weakened immune system so the obvious strategy
would necessarily only be to avoid the virus forever it would be also to
strengthen the immune system because that virus really can't do anything up
against a really strong immune system all right so let's talk about the next
player the B cells B cells make antibodies so antibodies are created
from an infection so in other words this is where your immune system learn
from being exposed to a very specific pathogen so soon as it gets exposed and
you go through the infection can you recover the next time that
specific microbe invade your body your immune system is ready it will
neutralize that infection so you have immunity you're not gonna have this
massive reaction anymore and one way that the antibodies do this
is they lock on to a pathogen it's like handcuffs and they keep it from going
into the cell so it dries out and it dies another way that it does it is it
tags the pathogen they assist in the killing by identifying who are the bad
guys so then the killer T cells come in there and do the dirty work
so Dave give me an example of something in the military that's equivalent to
that couple examples working as a team with other capabilities is really
critical to your effectiveness so one would be a sniper and the scout or the
spotter that's with him or her so you have one individual who's finding
targets and passing the information or where the targets are to the person who
has the skill to actually shoot the weapon so that's a man that is a very
effective team the scout and the sniper working together another one to be I
think a naval aviation in the Cold War one aircraft might fly out that has a
great sensor suite so they can soak up electronic signals while they're trying
to find an adversary ship or something like that but that aircraft isn't going
to have the weapons that would be needed to take out the actual ship so one
aircraft has the sensors the other one has the weapons and once the first one
finds the adversary then the other one is tasked with eliminating that
adversary all right so the last player and the adaptive immune system is called
the T regulatory cell now this cell is also called the T suppressor cell and
one of the functions of this cell is to differentiate between the bad guys and
the good guys so this is very very very important
because it's there to prevent autoimmune diseases and if this cell doesn't work
correctly your body will start to develop antibodies against its own
tissue and that could be to any tissue so you can have ms lupus Hashimoto's
rheumatoid arthritis where you have these antibodies that are attacking
itself autoimmune conditions is very similar to friendly-fire in the military
Dave can you give us a little example of what could happen in military if you
have a role player or a traitor we are very concerned about those interlopers
or those rogue agents well the military has a lot of things in place to find try
to find spies that kind of rogue element can do extreme damage to an entire
country its highest its greatest secrets on same thing even on that carrier
strike group example one adversary aircraft it's kind of hiding in a strike
force returning to the carrier could wipe out a carrier whether its defenses
are down so it's a critical to find who's or to be able to identify who's
friendly and who's not now another very important thing about the t-regulatory
cells is it has a suppressive action it calms down the immune system it puts out
the fire when you have this hyper inflammatory response it's called the
cytokine storm so really what kills people in certain infections is not
necessarily the viral entity it's these killer cells over here and this cell
because the regulatory cell is deficient we don't have this water hose to put out
the fire so that pretty much completes all the different players in the immune
system Dave do you have anything else you want to add to this there's a saying
that George General George Patton in World War two had and he said that
planning is everything and plans are nothing hmm in other words you can come
up with a plan to fight a battle but it everything is going to change after the
first shot is fired but the importance learning about your adversary
understanding yourself is absolutely everything you can identify how to
prepare you can identify your own weaknesses you can identify your
adversaries weaknesses and your own strengths and their strengths so you
know where to attack you know where to fortify your own weaknesses that's
everything that will help you be prepared to fight an adversary and our
military is doing that all the time against all our adversaries and I would
think that you would probably say that's exactly what your audience needs to be
doing and what we need to be doing ok I just want to say thank you so much for
your service and also for helping me in this presentation and I also want to
mention to you watching you have in your body right now the most amazing kick-ass
military immune system that ever existed and all you have to do is feed it the
right foods take care of it take the vitamin D the vitamin C the zinc and
it will return the favor by protecting you
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no
grains no sugar totally keto
there's no suffering on keto absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system
builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the
recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are
enjoying eating it

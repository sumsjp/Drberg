hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about the worst exercise
for that lower belly fat especially the flabby loose skin and the lower part of
your stomach okay and that would be sit ups and this goes against so many
different philosophies right because think about it when you're doing sit ups
yes you're getting the abdominal muscles contracted but that skin is getting
looser okay so I'm going to show you a better exercise and then as a reverse
sit up okay as you can see in the demonstration to my left you out you
want to actually go backwards you want to tighten up your abdomen muscles and
then you want to stretch backwards okay and you want to do that about 25 times
if you have lower back pain go really really light maybe you start off like
five or seven or maybe ten times and then you rest for a little bit because
sometimes when you're going back you can hurt yourself but typically most people
actually don't have a problem with this okay so you want to do sets of 25 rest
for about 3 or 4 minutes and then do 25 rest for about 3 or 4 minutes and then do 25
more 3 sets every single day what's going to happen is you are going to
stretch that skin okay so it's called the subcutaneous fat underneath there the
loose skin and the collagen and the the tissue on the surface of the abdomen
you're going to stretch that out going back and what's going to happen is it's
going to get toner and toner and toner now what happens with people doing
regular sit ups is they're trying to lose their belly fat and they do mass
amounts of sit-ups so they get the abdomen really really strong and they
start to go like this but they don't reverse it and get the opposite muscle
so they have an imbalance real strong abdomen muscles very weak back and so
they get back pain so this would be a really good exercise for you to do even
if you did sit-ups ok you want to reverse it and you can either lay on
your stomach and arch back up ok but the key is if you're doing a lot of sit-ups
do the opposite stretch but this specific exercise is really good for the
loose skin and the lower part of your stomach that little pooch that it's very
hard to tighten all right I will see you in the next video hey guys thanks for

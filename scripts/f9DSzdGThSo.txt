welcome everyone uh we have another amazing speaker today dr. zsofia clemens from hungary
and she's a neurobiologist the director of the international center for medical
nutritional intervention so welcome doctor how are you i'm fine thank you for the invitation how are
you doing i'm doing very well and uh first of all i want to know exactly what is a neurobiologist
and in addition to that how did you get involved in what you're doing right now did you have a
personal health problem that led you into this or how do you get so involved in what you're doing
um so it's a long story back to 10 years
so the long story short uh yes originally i am a biologist um and
specifically uh i'm a neuroscientist but i have always been working in a clinical setting
um actually in top institutes in hungary for neurology epilepsy psychiatry so
this was the this was my environment but i was always um mostly include involved in doing
research work in clinical settings in patients and then that involved
analyzing brain activity brain electrical activity in epilepsy patients
sleep and how this relates to memory processes sleep related memory consolidation for example
so i i've been around this topic for several years and then i started some research about
vitamin d specifically actually i was involved in the study that was the first of its kind
giving vitamin d3 to epilepsy patients who had uncontrolled seizures before
and also had low vitamin d levels and we looked at how normalizing vitamin d level
changes seizures epileptic seizures so so so this was the the first step towards doing towards
the the nutritional field and then i became involved in other aspects like brain structure
related to vitamin d personality traits related to vitamin d and there were many more around the
vitamin d and then i stepped forward and i i became interested in in nutrition as a whole
and i know that there is there is a lot of interest around vitamins
specifically like vitamin d but i had to realize that the nutritional context
as a whole is is much more important than single nutrients singular vitamins for example
well that's one of the reasons why i brought you on because you're in clinical practice which is
a huge difference between someone just doing research in a lab and never had any experience
they just graduated in their phd and then they they've never worked with actual patients so
until you do that you really have not applied these uh these ideas so yeah that's a huge
makes a huge difference because there are a lot of material around the internet and
it is very easy to set up theories and own ideas and those suggestions but if it is not confirmed
um by clinical data then it may not have a validity that's right i want to dive right into a
very specific topic um intestinal permeability and exactly what that is and maybe you can can we call
that generally speaking leaky gut a problem with like a leaky gut yes absolutely okay
and in the relationship to autoimmune disease since a good portion of our immune system is right
past the border of our intestine um tell us a little bit about um the the link between these two
topics and there's a lot a lot of questions that i have i just want to maybe you can give a little
introduction and then what occurs uh when you have that break in that that's those little junctions
um so the interstellar permeability is a is a membrane related phenomenon
there are membranes all around within the body that are connecting and separating uh species
within the body and there are also others that are separating us from outside the body
and the intestinal membrane is is one of those membranes and actually it is one of the most
important ones because that is the primary barrier between the content of our gut so
actually the foods that we are eating and and the rest of the body so that it is a primary location
and and and a lot of things are determined here if we are eating certain food items that
we are not supposed to eat then a leaky gut and increase intestinal permeability will develop
and if it is already there then there are certain food items that may be the same or
maybe different from the ones that um actually resulted in the leaky gut but these food items can
go across the barrier and they may get into the circulation
and then if this has occurred they may form certain complex with surface molecules of
certain cells within our bodies and if such a complex is created the immune system may start
attacking that complex because the immune system um regards this complex as as as a as a foreign
molecule there's a certain part of your immune system that is actively trying to suppress
autoimmune reactions right there's a it's a t cell that's um trying to prevent that i think
the t helper cells aren't they uh and somehow i know for example in like uh psoriasis there's a
higher amounts of i guess it would be like th17 giving you these cytokines
and this cascade of inflammation and now you're you're in a situation where your own tissue is
attacking cells of the skin yeah so the the the thing is that uh so far you keep eating
those bad food items the whole process will be going on so and and there is no
other cue for this than eliminating certain food items from your diet and then the whole process
can attenuate and um i i'm not a scientist at the molecular level i i cannot tell you whether it is
uh t hat or cells or not or to what extent there are these are involved or not and i guess nobody
else can really tell this because nobody looked at specifically a certain dietary
context so that there may be a very different situation if you are eating a high carb diet and
another one if you are fasting or doing a low carb diet so it is the diet itself that that matters
and you do not have to think about t harper says or you do not have to be an immunologist
phd or whatever right the um the interesting the only point i brought that up is because
there is one nutrient that tends to suppress that reaction which is vitamin d again we come
back to vitamin d which is interesting because it tends to modulate inflammation in your body
question i have as far as the you have a very specific um
uh diet or eating plan which is very beneficial to people with autoimmune
and it's um it's not carnivore but it's a kind of a paleolithic version of keto um explain that
uh it is sorry just going back to the vitamin d point um the thing is that i
don't believe that vitamin d alone is enough to counteract the inflammation process or
psoriasis it is the elimination of certain food items that really matters if you do not eliminate
then then you can have a skyrocketing vitamin d level and it will not help
absolutely and that's the problem with most people they like they don't change their basic eating
they think a pill or a drug is going to do it but that that's like it's kind of an altered sequence
you first have to fix the what you put in the body before you even deal with some of these remedies
yes okay so the other question uh how how this diet differs from the classical ketogenic diet
yes this is your question yes so um it it is only the ratio between meat that protein fat and um
carbohydrate that determines whether you are entering in ketosis or not it this is very simple
actually it is very simple to induce ketosis if you eat the right amount and the right ratio
of these make macronutrients but um creating keto this is not not enough it is not enough
it is enough for something if you are aim if you are aiming at losing weight
improving body composition improving blood sugar hypertension then ketosis alone may be enough
but if you have an autoimmune condition or if you have cancer then ketosis alone will not be enough
i'm not saying may not it will not be enough right
and that's something that that you have to keep in mind that any ketogenic diet will not be enough
if you are struggling with a specific autoimmunity or cancer and this is because
the composition of your diet also matters not just on macronutrient composition
and it is only a diet that is based on meat fat and organ meats that is effective in in combatix
combating such conditions if you are eating a classical version of ketogenic diet let's put
it in this way that is containing vegetable oils and dairy which is the case with the classical
ketogenic diet or there are other mct oil based and then the other ones that all uh are based on
unhealthy vegetable oils and dairy let me let me define the classical for those people that
don't know there's a lot of initial research on using what's called a classical ketogenic diet
for epilepsy in these children where they're they're not looking at the the quality of the
the product so you so you're doing like this mayonnaise and whipping cream and all these
i consider uh bad quality foods and uh even though even though it's uh low carb it's going to be a
problem go ahead yeah yeah exactly and here we come back to the intestinal permeability issue
because such a diet the classical ketogenic diet is not able to normalize intestinal permeability
and if you do not normalize intestinal permeability the whole process will be going on
and and this is not out of theory what i am saying we see this being measured in our patients
in course of their diseases is there any um like there's two there's two things going
on you have the elimination of things that irritate and cause inflammation in the gut
but you also have is there any direct um healing factor of either certain organ meats or saturated
fats on the intestinal lining itself no no these are separate things so so there are there are
certain food items like milk vegetable oil grains nitrates that are creating intestinal permeability
medicines as well or anti-inflammatory drugs have a huge effect they are creating intestinal
permeability their leaky gut and if you have the leaky gut and go on eating grains milk potato and
so on then that will create inflammation in the body that we create an increase in the intestine
in the inflammatory factors so the the the inflammation is is the end result
and you cannot interfere with vitamin d you can only interfere with elimination
so when you when you switch your diet to what you're doing right now
um you're you're eliminating the um the irritation the stimulation of this
this inflammatory process we are eliminating those factors that maintain the leaky gut
and as a result there will be a decrease in the inflammation and the symptoms and eventually
curing disease love it and so can you give my viewers an idea of like examples of types of foods
because you're going to be doing you're not going to be doing low fat protein you want to do high
higher fat proteins what would be some examples of that so um speaking of cancer
you know not this is not aimed at your general audience maybe but specifically
those who have an already existing disease have undergone chemotherapy radiotherapy so
so the possibilities for them are very narrow okay so for these people um there is a core diet
which only includes meat fats and organ meats also autoimmune patients right
also autoimmune patients yes so so they they do not really have another choice
we would love to uh pleasing patients saying then that you can introduce this and that and
um but it wouldn't um be in the interest of the patient
such patients needs is to restore normal intestinal barrier because they do not have time
to lose they they have to do it as quickly as possible yeah and once that's done then and
reach there i used to say they they baseline they they own has baseline and condition is stabilized
there without medications symptoms and so on then can they can think about or we can consider
allowing for introducing um certain food items but this shouldn't be grains this shouldn't be
nitrates and a lot of things shouldn't be and what um like you would probably find some higher
quality grass-fed maybe fatty sausage or liver or other foods that are higher in obviously fat
because it's it's actually i find it's really hard in in the us to find fatty protein now days
at the store it's like you have to go out of your way to because everything is so lean and um yeah
you know this is absolutely a cultural thing this is not a problem in europe you know we
grown up eating crazy bread which is obviously not the best combination of foods
but fat was incorporated heavily in our diet this is not the case in america because
fear has been feared for so long time that you didn't you know came across um
and so this is a cultural thing i think we have a lot of good food items sausages
that are already containing eat fat in a good ratio and or bloody sausage or or many other
traditional food items and and most of these food ensembles are coming from from pig pork um which
in here in central europe is is is more widespread than the beef actually interesting it is also high
higher quality than it is the pork is in the us i can imagine yeah because i uh i actually
consume a lot of pork and i know a lot of people are saying well that pork is dirty well i don't
i don't buy it from the grocery store i do the farmers markets where people that i know
they they they don't feed them certain things but pork is higher in fat it's higher in nutrients
actually b1 i feel better on pork especially pork sausage what um what about the fish in seafood
um so the the diet of pkd core diet is based on meat fat and organs from four-legged animals
okay specifically because it is more complete in nutrients as compared to the fish or any
fish or seafood so there are certain food there are certain minerals that fish is very rich in
but meat fat and organs are containing the entirety of the nutrients and at the same time not
um usually not as polluted um as the fish or the or the seafood fascinating and and uh what um um
when you take your clients you probably have people coming in flying in from around the world
probably and when you see them um they have all sorts of autoimmune issues and um what um what are
some of the barriers that you run into i mean this is a probably a drastic change for a lot of people
are but i'm sure that they're motivated and they're they're like hey listen just tell me what
to do and i'll do it versus the typical person that is you know not very motivated yes they're
they're more motivated than than average patients so they are already familiar of the concept so
and and many are coming from the carnivore society so they are already not eating a lot of food items
um it is only the the the ratio and the food amount that that should be fine-tuned and um
cutting out a few other additional stuff that that may not be that may may not allow for a
perfect recovery but we are in content mostly online specifically in these times oh good how
would you differentiate carnivore versus what you're recommending which is um paleo ketogenic
so the carnivore diet
in most cases not resulting in ketosis so those who are following an undefined carnivore diet
are still running their body on carbohydrates instead of fats despite not eating carbohydrates
tell me about that but explain that yeah so um an average people on a carnivore diet is eating
800 to 1.5 800 grams to 1.5 kilograms of meat or something like that which is a huge amount
that put a lot of pressure on your digestive system because the volume is is too much
um you are not in ketosis you are still producing glucose from the protein that you eat
and overall it is it is an ineffective way of obtaining energy so i want to cl i want
to clarify just for my viewers that even though there's no carbohydrates in protein
if you have excessive amounts the body is going to take a good portion of that and break it down into
glucose yes because there is no other way to obtain energy
you can have energy either from carbohydrates or fat right protein is not good for energy
and we need the energy what you eat is basically for uh covering your energy needs
it is also a very small amount of meat that you have to eat to cover the protein need
okay so um so that's a big difference you have um it's way too much protein and then
let's i'll just let you continue we're going to mention something about the fat
um sorry i didn't get your question uh i i cut you off right in the middle you were talking about
um the difference between carnivore and um what you're recommending
um so so the difference is that if you are following a carnivore diet you are still
running your body on glucose despite the fact that you are not eating carbohydrates at all right
so it is not resulting in ketosis you will not benefit um you will not have the benefits that
are coming from the ketosis alone you will have the benefits of not eating plant food items but
that's only that that's only half of your benefits you also need to be in ketosis because if not this
this this state is not sustainable in the long run and this is what is happening with with patients
initially they they feel relieved from from their symptoms and they start
enjoying having more energy or skin symptoms going away so there are certain benefits for sure but as
time is going on um the negative consequences will prevail over the positive ones you you they will
be running out of energy they will be fatigued they will have digestive issues diarrhea um
a dry skin and and there are many more that develop over a longer period of time interesting
so so bringing down the protein to what what do you normally recommend is actual protein
um so um we used to do um a two week follow-up for patients
because there is no there is no one general suggestion that it is much less than
people used to eat okay and then and then we are in a closed loop with patients on a day by day
feedback they are doing home measurements they are sending their home measurements every day
and then we are giving a suggestion day by day you should be decreasing you should be increasing
so so this is a matter of fine tuning i like that by the end of the two weeks um they will they will
end up having um ideally good amount of food and good ratio and then as far as the fat you have to
raise the fat or else what else are you going to raise so what's the ratio maybe a protein to fat
so speaking of dry matter content it is two to one two for the fat one for the protein and that's
weight that's not calories this is dry matter content okay macronutrients if we translate it
to food that is about 100 grams of meat an average meat that goes along with 35 grams of
added fat so this is the basic ratio because when you're eating protein or or animal
meat in its normal form does it come with the ratio of that much fat or do you have to add
fat you have to add fat right so you can't just you can't just go on what nature is product
because we actually have to put your body into a different but nature is also providing fat it
is just not entrenched in some cultures you know interesting just because you do not see fat itself
at the butcher it doesn't mean that nature is not providing the fat you know right and we're
not talking about avocados even coconut oil we're talking about like talo and um what about ghee
ghee is a form of dairy that is containing milk proteins that
is triggering autoimmune processes even when you clarify it and get rid of the
solid materials yes but because you cannot get rid of all the molecules okay okay not
have a laboratory but it is simply technically not possible so you have to go with vitello
or in in hungary you can do smoked slab which is which is the actual uh
fat coming from the actual fat tissue or the pork and there are a few others you know also you have
something like bacon but the problem with bacon is when you fry it like all the fat goes away
yes you have to eat the fat that goes away right right and so for those people are listening and
that are confused because it may conflict with some other videos that i've done
we're talking about people that are addressing that have
intestinal damage autoimmune other conditions that are going to react with this but
so i just want to clarify that um so can you give us a couple more examples on
like let's say organ meats um would that have enough fat or like maybe a pet pate right
what pate which is uh kind of a yeah if you prepare uh based on your own recipe then it can
contain enough fat of course yeah so so the fat is uh predominantly coming from the visceral fat
of the animal and and for example beef is not containing enough fat if if if you take the
whole animal specifically those breeds um that are designed to be lean that's for sure so so
you have to specifically go for the uh for the fed that is cut of the of the meat that is sold
for for other clients right right um now let's say someone has autoimmune there's a i know there is
a test that's called i guess peg peg400 which um is a lab test that you you drink something it gets
filtered out through the kidneys or the intestines and the kidneys i guess and you can pick up
some data tell me tell me a little bit about that actually um this is this is a this is an old test
you can you can find the references uh in the literature back to 1970s 80s 90s
so it has been used in in in in the medical world or at least somewhere in the medical world but um
later on they they forgot about it uh mainly because they didn't have a solution so anybody
they measured had high intestinal permeability and they asked themselves what can we do we can't
do anything about it so let's stop measuring it so actually the methodology was was given
and we started using the test there is a laboratory in london
the laboratory is called biolab and we first collaborated with this laboratory
we send measurements to them or the samples but then we started doing our own
own measurements and in order to do so we have we have furthered the methodology behind it uh
a critical point of the measurement is clarifying the sample and and and this is uh this is a very
critical point a critical methodological point so we have been working a lot at this point but now
the the methodology is fathered and it is working very well so patients um can actually buy they can
can purchase this test even from the u.s they do not even have to come to hungary or anywhere else
they are getting the test material that is containing the pegging in a small container
they have to drink the small container and then they have to collect the urine across six hours
and then a small sample should be sent back to to our laboratory and then we do the measurement
and and the recovery of the peg in the urine uh the percentage of the recovery will show
uh the extent of the intestinal permeability so basically you have these um compounds that are
going through the body and if there's a hole through your intestine you're going to have
more of them on the other side versus less and you could be able to get feedback on what's happening
in your gut yeah so so normally there should be no uh bad molecules going through the intestine
or at least very minimal and if there is if there are peg molecules crossing the barrier
getting into the circulation being excreted in the urine it means that there is a permeability
and it is not only about having permeability or not having a permeability it is 11 different
size of peg molecules that is to be found in the solution so it it it is giving you um
a resolution across the molecular sizes so at the end we have a we have a certain curve or or
pattern of the recovery percentages for each of the specific molecular ranges that is carrying
information and so far the curve is higher than uh the range that is regarded as normal
it is it it is uh regarded as the patient having a industrial permeability and it is expected
that uh with following the pkd the intestinal permeability curve goes back to the normal range
or actually closer to the low end of the normal range if it is not happening then that there's
still something that is preventing this and and and this is where the the small details may matter
because there are small food items or even medicines or even certain supplements that
can hinder the normalization of the intestinal permeability fascinating i i recently looked
bought and i'm looking through and studying a book that is talking about vaccine-induced autoimmunity
what's your quick summary on the
people getting a vaccine and all of a sudden ending up with a autoimmune condition
yes that's uh that's a big topic and i do think that there is definitely a connection because by
injecting the vaccine right into the body you are bypassing this actual intestinal barrier
in the same way as having very high intestinal permeability uh but but this material is is is
getting into your body into your tissues and if it is already there and that can provoke autoimmunity
and and this is this is something that is frequently uh the case uh with the sudden onset
type one diabetes in children or suddenly crohn's disease epilepsy or many other brain conditions
and the importance is underestimated by the medical community but this is happening
yes there's certain um i this book was written in india so it hasn't reached america uh but
the other other question is um you have vegetable oils like the soy oil the corn
oil the canola the cottonseedle that is permeated through our entire food
chain and which is highly inflammatory because it's omega-6 not to mention the quality and
it oxidizes and it creates a lot of inflammation uh do you think that's a pretty big factor
um it may be that it is not the fatty acid um specifically or the fat specifically uh
but other components that are coming from that specific plant could it be the glyphosate in
the gmo or or other factors no because that that is an additive uh i i'm thinking of
the the lactine content of the plants so any any plant is containing thousands and
ten thousand some different lectins and some of some of them are more dangerous are more
more dangerous for intestinal barrier than others like the soil so is the one
that is heavily triggering industrial permeability
and there are others for example that are coming from the carrot which are not that dangerous or
do not have such a big effect but it is it is the lactin um component or or the ones that
are coming from the night shades that are really bad for okay conditions interesting um what about
um there's a patient that i know a while ago that had um they didn't have any
necessarily problems with autoimmune but all of a sudden they did a colon cleanse and they wiped out
everything in their gut for about i think seven days and they ended up with psoriasis um so
i guess there's certain factors in your your microbes that actually
protect you when you lose those it can create an imbalance um so actually these screens are
are not too healthy i have to tell you they are using these vegetable or fruit-based juices right
and and while they are doing this they are not eating the the right foods
so the combination is what is resulting in a deterioration of the conditions and also if you
have an already existing disease it is very likely that you have certain nutrient deficiencies if you
start doing fasting or juicing which is something very similar then your nutrients will be further
depleted and and you may end up in a in a condition that is worse than the original ones
wow wow this has been awesome go ahead no really there is no no need for overcomplicating things
you just have to follow the right diet and then you do not have to take away anything you you
shouldn't add anything once you are back to the diet that is right uh designed for you
then that is the way to go and people are obsessed with different uh you know techniques and um
approaches that that sound good at the level of the world but that in in reality they they
usually do not work i totally agree well i want to thank you so much for uh giving
me this valuable data and giving everyone else this very amazing new viewpoint i think
what i'm going to do is i want to put some links down below of your your website and how people can
get a hold of you and as well as maybe i'll even put a link down for that test so people can get
more information about that test as well i will send it to you thank you very much oh thank you

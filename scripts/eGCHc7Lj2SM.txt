so i had some questions recently
relating to coming off of a psych drug
how to do it and i highly recommend you
do this
but it has to be done correctly and what
i mean by that
is it has to be done under your doctor's
supervision
why because if you are number one
dependent on a psych drug you've taken
it for a long period of time
and you come off of it too quickly
chances are you're going to have side
effects
okay so you want a very slow
transition off this medication
with supervision number two
if you're taking a natural remedy and
your drug at the same time
because a lot of these drugs work to
block the
recycling of a neurotransmitter so you
end up with more of a neurotransmitter
so if you're also taking something like
st
john's wort at the same time you're also
taking this
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
you can end up with too much of a
certain neurotransmitter and creating
other
problems so get some supervision find a
doctor who's willing to work with you
if your doctor is not willing to work
with you find another doctor that is
willing to work with you
because the longer you're on this
medication the more the neurons are
dependent on this medication so any
alteration can really throw your
your body out of balance however you
should start
with a diet change and i'm talking about
healthy keto
that means nutrient dense type foods
with
low carbs and higher amounts of fats
with intermittent fasting
why because both of those are going to
significantly affect your brain in a
very positive way
it'll lay a foundation so it's going to
be easier to come off this medication
both a low carb diet and intermittent
fasting will not act as a drug it'll act
to
help you improve your mood then if we
add exercise to it
and you add vitamins minerals trace
minerals
essential fats i'm talking about omega-3
fatty acids
all of that is going to significantly
help because that psych drug is also
depleting you of nutrients
and so chances are you're deficient but
i wanted to create this important video
just
just to emphasize the point of a slow
transition
that's supervised by someone that
actually can help you
do this correctly so it's not a sudden
change so you can eventually come off
this drug
because you don't need it anymore
because your body's back into balance
and you did it in a correct way hey
before you go
if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would
love to hear about your success story

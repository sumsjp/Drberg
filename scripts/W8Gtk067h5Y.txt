check this out this pizza is totally
legal totally
healthy and I'm going to show you how to
make it um this is a great recipe the
key is the crust um this the crust is
made with cauliflower and mozzarella
cheese there is no bread there is no bad
things there's no sugar none of that in
there no MSG and um this is an a
cruciferous Pizza you can um have it as
much as you want um and it's actually
very very healthy for you so let me show
you exactly how to make this and just so
you know you can have this as much as
you want it will not cause weight gain
so let's show you how to make
it okay so now the secret to making this
pizza is in the crust and I've made this
12 different times and I've made every
mistake in the book and I'm going to
show you how to do it correctly now the
crust is really very very simple 2 cups
of cauliflower which by the way is a
cruciferous vegetable cuz we can't use
Kale it's going to be too green but
cauliflower is a very healthy anti-aging
has a lot of phytonutrients and then
we're going to use mozzarella cheese
okay so I'm going to do organic you
don't have to do organic I just
recommend if you can find organic that
would be better and two eggs whole eggs
organic eggs or Freer range eggs so 2
cups of cauliflower 2 cups of mozzarella
cheese shaved and two eggs and we're
going to mix it together it's not going
to seem like it's going to make a crust
but just watch and
see so simply we're going to make take
the
cauliflower and a grater you don't need
a food processor and we're going to
grade this cauliflower down very very
simple
okay so now I would take out the big
chunks that didn't really scrape in
there and we're just going to take two
cups of this cauliflower two cups in a
bowl that's
it obviously I made too much
here okay two cups unless you want two
pizzas okay then we're going to just
take this organic shredded mozzarella
cheese you can get fresh mozzarella you
could even use U mozzarella goat cheese
if you want but it just so happens that
I already know that this makes two cups
but I'll just show you right here so we
got one cup right
here okay and then two
cups see
that all right then we just simply take
two eggs really
simple yeah that's is going to work
isn't it okay there we go
all right you can tell that I'm not a
cook all right but it seems to work now
look at this I have two eggs two cups of
mozzarella cheese and two cups of
um of cauliflower and we're just going
to mix this around it's kind of weird
because it just doesn't seem to look
like it's going to make a
crust but it's going
to you'll see
now don't put salt in it because the
mozzarella cheese is already salty
enough and uh I do see some bigger
little chunks here I'll take this out
cuz I don't want that Chunk in
there all right we're just going to mix
it up just like that that's what it
looks like now check this out I'm going
to just show you
something this is what the crust looks
like when we cook
okay look at this it's crispy it's
somewhat hard that's what it's going to
turn into so it melts and it Browns and
you're going to cook it for 15 minutes
so the hardest part about this whole
thing is making it on the parchment
paper Okay so let's talk about how we're
going to put this in here get these
little cheap little pizza tins right
here and then we're going to take
parchment paper if you don't use
parchment paper it's going to be a
little hard to get it off there unless
you put a lot of olive oil underneath it
so the hardest
part is cutting the parchment paper
to this pan here so I'm going to just
attempt to do it right here kind of work
with it a little
bit I'm sure there's a technique to it I
don't
know so didn't quite fit here so I have
to trim it up now because this pizza has
mozzarella cheese it's
somewhat um oily so you don't have to
put any oil on this pan so I'm going to
just show you right here going to take
this thing right
here and we are going to put it right in
the center now just so you know I did
wash my hands so don't worry about
that does drberg wash his hands yes he
does okay so now I'm going to just take
this thing right here and I'm going to
kind of even it up here all right then
I'm going to use my washed hands and
start to press and flatten so the secret
number one is to have the parchment
paper secret number two is to make it
really thin okay now there there are
some
things I've tried like taking some of
the moisture out because it's a little
moist in a microwave or even in the oven
it's not necessary it's really not so
I'm just you can see that I have some
more space over here so I'm going to
just start from the center and just kind
of slowly kind of push it towards the
edge here and flatten this thing right
here okay now I already preheated the
oven to 450° so that's all ready for
us
so
okay now this is what it looks like very
simple we stick in the oven 40 for 15
minutes okay and then it's going to come
out like this right here so let's go
ahead and stick in the oven and I'll
show you the next
step okay so we got the crust cooked at
15 minutes at 40 150° now we're going to
put the sauce on it now take a look um
you can use actual pizza sauce or you
can use um pasta sauce uh spaghetti
sauce
so you just want to make sure that it
doesn't have that Sugar High frous corn
syrup this one's really really good this
has no sugars uh it's a bit expensive
but this would be fine too this has no
added sugars as well so
yeah it's not too bad try to find
someone something with very low sugar
and we're just going to take this and
we're going to put a little tomato sauce
right on the center there um I did make
a mistake of putting too much sauce so
it really depends on your taste so start
off putting just a little bit of sauce
on it and then see if it works so I'm
going to probably put a little bit more
sauce right here and
here roughly a/4 cup so we're just going
to put the sauce smeared around now
we're going to put some
more mozzarella cheese on the on the top
so I'm just going to take some
cheese sprinkle
it not too much just
[Applause]
enough okay so we got the cheese on
there now uh we're going to put
some mushrooms all right I love
mushrooms I'm just going to cut these
little bad boys right
here put some mushrooms on
it okay then we're going to put a tomato
now this is a real tomato you notice
it's not perfect it has a bunch of
little holes in it this is the good
stuff this is what it tastes it actually
tastes really
good okay so we going to just put some
chunks on
there now we're going to use some basil
all right so I've been growing some
basil out here for the pizza so I'm
going to just chop some of this off
right
here okay so with basil I'm just going
to put the whole leaf on it not going to
cut
it but it adds a lot of
Flavor now we got the basil on there now
I'm just you don't have to do this I'm
using uh some
pepperoni cuz my kids like
pepperoni and then we're just going to
put this on there
there we
go okay so I'm going to put a
little a little pepperoni on
there good so let's go ahead and stick
in the oven and let's see what happens

Do you ever feel absent-minded let me show you how to stop it what is being
absent-minded it's basically a lapse of awareness you're forgetful easily
distracted and all of this occurs because your neurons your brain cells
are tired and they're basically starving for energy you see the neurons are
usually dependent on glucose or lactate okay these are fuel sources but what
happens is when you consume those fuels they have a bit of a side effect because
cognitive dysfunction as well as absent-minded good thing that your body
can use another type of fuel and that fuel is called what was that umm let me
think oh that's right ketones that's right
ketones suppress glucose consumption or utilization let me explain if there is
ketones and glucose in your blood okay so here's your blood vessel you have
ketones and glucose glucose will not be utilized by your brain because ketones
prevent glucose from being utilized if there's ketones in your blood now in the
rest of the body it's the exact opposite if you're trying to get into ketosis or
you're taking ketones then you eat some carbohydrate and you have glucose in
your blood ketones will be suppressed and your body will be utilizing the
glucose but if there's ketones and glucose in their blood the body will
prefer ketones but what happens when you have cognitive impairments and you
become absent-minded the actual nerve cells whether it's from any gene or
chronic consumption of glucose you start damaging neurons in certain parts of the
brain the prefrontal cortex hippocampus then you start to what was I just
thinking become absent-minded the simple solution to even bypass a damaged nerve
cell is to start to increase your ketones
the ketones will do a lot of things first of all they're going to feed the
neuron what needs to function ketones also affect
the potassium channels and those channels are intimately involved in the
communication process between neurons now we have way more communication and
by the way don't forget to consume a lot of potassium from your foods or
supplements to make sure you have enough raw material also the mitochondria which
is the energy factory of the cell when it burns ketones there'll be less waste
product when the body burns glucose there's a lot of garbage as residue but
not with ketones it's more efficient you'll be able to extract more energy
from the calories that you're consuming how do you generate ketones well it's
very simple you just lower your carbohydrates below
50 for a lot of people you need to go down to 20 or even less if you're older
and you have a slow metabolism the other thing that's really really important you
want to increase the time of fasting okay so in a minute fasting is very very
important to repair a damaged brain not only will you generate way more ketones
you will also kick in certain genes that stimulate the growth of neurons we get
what's called autophagy autophagy is a state where you're you're cleaning up
all the damaged proteins in the brain and the rest of the body so you're
you're making the body really clean so it can function very very well so
fasting is very very important and you wouldn't want to go at least eighteen
hours of fasting with a six hour eating window combined with lower carbs to
start to turn this thing around but because ketones do suppress glucose
consumption you may want to also take ketones now exogenous ketones are a
bit expensive and less expensive a very efficient way to do it is just by adding
MCT oil now some people actually use MCT oil to supply like half of the dietary
fats you can do that but if you're gonna start MCT oil always go into it slowly
because too much too fast can cause diarrhea or cramping so you start
with one teaspoon and then one tablespoon and then more and more more
gradually over that weeks but if you're absent-minded or you have cognitive
issues you definitely need to do both of these together and if you want to you
know speed things up you can actually add that and even spread it through the
day so you're constantly having ketones in your blood and so your brain will
just pull it right in despite how much glucose you have in your blood now
there's definitely some other things that you need to do to get rid of this
symptom and that's what it is it's a symptom it's not a disease it's a
symptom of a damaged nerve self and the one is sleep okay if you are sleep
deprived I guarantee you will be absent-minded because the effects that
this has on cortisol and stress and blood sugars it literally will destroy
your brain also number two stop thinking so much
it's very common nowadays with the amount of stress that people go through
to be in a state of constant analysis okay or thinking or solving problems
24/7 even when they're sleeping even when they're exercising even when
they're going for a walk in nature they're not even kind of looking out in
nature they're so stuck in their head analyzing everything to death it's very
vital to take at least a small portion of the day one hour a day okay and just
stop thinking go out there in nature and just start getting your attention going
out and it's hard though because your attention is so stuck in this problem
and that problem this problem it's hard to undo it but you need to do it to kind
of reset and get your focus back and then the microbiome and you've got
there's a huge connection between the state of microbes in your gut and your
cognitive function because these microbes actually make amino acids that
then turn into neurotransmitters and so there's this whole freeway channel
between your gut and your brain back and forth definitely make mental now that if
your gut is not work on that take a probiotic get your
diet straightened out and you'll find that your cognitive function will be a
much much better there's quite a few connections between even Alzheimer's and
gut health so I'll put some links down below alright guys so that's a wrap on
this video there's another one on brain physiology that's actually quite
interesting I think you'll like that one I put it right here

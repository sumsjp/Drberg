this video is about the top remedies for a uti updated i had an older video on this topic but i
wanted to update it with some new information a uti stands for urinary tract infection
and this can be in the lower part as in a bladder infection or the upper part which
could be more of a kidney infection now the most common pathogen that's involved with these utis
is e coli now normally in our bodies e coli is not harmful okay it's neutral it lives in
our body and it doesn't create any problem so what would make this e coli unfriendly
and the answer to that would be the environment okay that it lives in so let's go through the
different things that can change the environment for this microbe and there's other microbes too
mainly bacteria that can turn more pathogenic and create this problem number one having high
glucose so if you're diabetic you're at a higher risk than someone that doesn't have diabetes
because all this sugar changes the environment and it feeds a lot of the pathogens especially
funguses yeast and candida okay which can also create a uti so based on that you'd want
to definitely cut out the sugar if you have an uti next point is high estrogen okay now
this can occur when someone's pregnant or they're ovulating there's a higher chance of getting a uti
during ovulation and when you're pregnant because of this estrogen okay so there's definitely a
shift of estrogen that can affect your immune system and also going the other way too because
if your estrogen is lower okay that can alter the um the barrier the like the vaginal flora
the good bacteria that's supposed to protect you and this is why women that are post menopausal
have a higher risk of getting utis as well so estrogen too high or too low can be a problem now
the other thing is antibiotics especially can ally antibiotics kill off not just the good but the bad
and then these pathogenic bacteria get pissed off and then they start to create problems and
inflammation and infection and also funguses and candida because antibiotics don't kill the fungus
and the yeast so they live they just you just kill all the bacteria so now we have this overgrowth
it can create a situation and especially if you have to take frequent antibiotics
and you develop this resistance to antibiotics and then they don't work anymore and now you have utis
very very often so it's not the best long term solution now intercourse can also be a problem
with cross contamination and then catheters can also increase your risk of getting a uti
so let me just tell you some really good remedies that you can use for a uti so the first remnant
is called buchu this is probably one of the best things you can take for uti it's stood the test
of time it's been around for a very very long time it's highly anti-microbial it's anti-at
in other words it prevents the bacteria from attaching it's been shown to decrease the risk of
getting infection in the bladder and the prostate and the urethra and on top of that it's a natural
diuretic okay next one is cranberry this one is also anti-adhesive and it prevents the bacteria
from accumulating on the inside of the bladder and the other ducts and it can also inhibit biofilms
which tend to accumulate in the bladder and the kidney and the connections then you have uva ursi
which can act as a natural diuretic and the next one is juniper which is a great antimicrobial
for the bladder as well as a kidney and the last two things which are not herbal remedies
but they're highly recommended number one doing fasting fasting is probably one of the
most potent things to help your immune system really fast just stop eating for a while maybe
a whole day maybe two days and you will probably see great improvements in your immune system
and then also like i just mentioned previously cut out the carbs go on a low sugar diet because
that's what feeds these pathogens so we want to starve them off especially
if it's a yeast infection a candida infection or a fungal infection all right thanks for watching

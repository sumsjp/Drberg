did you realize that cavities are the
second most common
disease worldwide the number one disease
is the common cold
but cavities come in number two what is
a cavity
well the root word for cavity means
whole there's a hole in your tooth
you're getting
dental decay in other words the bone
is dissolving and it's breaking down
to the point where there's a hole in it
now what's unique about
the teeth is that they're supposed to be
indestructible
and you don't have cells that are
constantly being replaced
on this enamel this outside of this
tooth right here they know this from
looking at fossils
certain skulls the teeth are usually
still there
and they're very indestructible but
there's one thing
that will destroy them and that is a
certain type of
bacteria they've isolated streptococcus
mutants as being the main bacteria that
apparently is causing
these little holes and you have a lot of
friendly bacteria that are living in
your mouth
as you consume sugar and other
carbohydrates that
can ferment what happens is the
population of this bacteria starts going
higher and higher and higher
until it hits a certain tipping point
where it's now dominating
and when it ferments this sugar it
creates an
acid which dissolves or demineralizes
your bone creating a hole when you
consume certain
refined carbohydrates and sugar you're
feeding
this microbe and you're getting the
plaque forming bacteria
which is then causing decay because it's
creating an acid
of course the solution to this is just
to brush your teeth right
and make sure that your toothpaste has
fluoride and
you drink water with fluoride and you're
good to go right
well here's the problem we still have a
problem with cavities in fact
90 of the population has cavities
why well when you look this up they're
really emphasizing
this bacteria and that you have to scrub
and
keep your teeth clean and and make sure
you're exposed to fluoride so you can
kill these microbes but
what about the food what about the the
fuel that they
live on to create this whole thing
they're really not talking about this
this is
omitted information okay the question is
why is this information omitted
recently there was some new information
that gave some
light on this topic and there are
certain documents found
now don't quote me on this but i think
it was in the basement
of harvard university's library but it
could have been
in some other basement but they found
this interesting
document it was actually by the sugar
trade
organization that was funded by the
sugar industry
and this is what the document revealed
that the sugar industry
paid off a key researcher from harvard
university
50 years ago to downplay the
relationship between dietary sugar and
heart disease
and dietary sugar and cavities
and put the blame on dietary fat in fact
this study
back then did not reveal the source
of the funding now we're still left with
this idea
that we just need to keep brushing and
taking her fluoride
to prevent the cavities when it's not
working
in fact there's a condition called
fluorosis
okay in fact if you look this up it'll
say it's a cosmetic problem with the
tooth okay
part of the tooth uh turns like
excessive white it's like a
bleaching effect the truth is that when
you expose a young child
to too much fluoride it can weaken the
teeth it can affect
calcium metabolism in your body and
give this appearance right here but
what's happening is the whole tooth is
becoming weak itself
and apparently it's very very common
where there's 40 to 60 percent of the
children
actually have that condition and it's
actually quite interesting to me of how
much corruption that's still going on
with
so-called science of course you know
science is a sacred cow
it's beyond criticism it's beyond debate
but what about
the massive corruption that's going on
there are so many
scientific concepts that
end up being false 30 to 40 to 50 to 60
years later unfortunately so if you have
kids or your kid watching this
just cut out the sugar okay and you'll
cut out the cavities
very very simple thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing
recipe no brains
no sugar totally keto there's no
suffering in keto absolutely not karen
and it's an immune system builder
absolutely
you have to check this out i think you

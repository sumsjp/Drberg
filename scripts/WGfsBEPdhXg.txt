just had a person who was on my live show and she said that she went off the
program okay and then when she went back on the program I'm talking about keto and
intermittent fasting it didn't work no results and she's frustrated because it
worked before why does it work now well the best way to screw up your metabolism
is to go off the program and then back on the program and off the program and
back on back and forth what you're doing is you're confusing your metabolism your
metabolism is a living dynamic thing that adapts to the environment to the
foods that you eat the number of times you go on and off and you're not
consistent you're gonna have problems now I know this probably doesn't apply
to you but you may have friends or family members that are not consistent
with keto here's what you tell them there are three variables you work with
you got the carbs you got the protein you want to keep the protein at a
moderate amount not too high not too low every one is a little bit different at
the very minimum three ounces to eight ounces depending on your metabolism your
age and how big you are but the other two variables are very
very important the slower the metabolism the lower you need to reduce
your carbs bring it down to 10 grams per day not per meal if you have too much
fat your body will start to turn the dietary fat in to ketones more than
your own fat so let's bring this down not less than 75 grams okay so right
there that's going to help you and then next one is too fast longer these three
actions right here should pretty much handle the problem so whatever fasting
schedule you are on if it's whether you're eating two times a day just bring
it down to once a day if you're at once a day oh man then reduce it to one meal
every other day don't forget to take the supplements in between so you have
enough electrolytes if that doesn't speed things up then we need to add more
sleep and reduce more stress usually reducing
stress will help you sleep more and sleep being more will reduce your stress
so these go hand in hand and to be able to sleep you may need to exercise to
reduce the stress but don't over exercise but these are three really
important variables there's other ones as well be consistent don't go off the
program for very long maybe for one meal or something then get right back on but
stay consistent and that way you can take your body out of confusion so it
can work with you instead of against you thanks for watching

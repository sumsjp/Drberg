let's talk about sleep okay
if you're having problems sleeping it's
very important to find the underlying
cause because if you treat the symptom
you only get so far you have to in fact
keep treating the symptom because you're
not getting rid of the cause it can
camouflage the real reason why you can't
sleep so the more you target the real
cause the better the results there are
various reasons why people can't sleep
number one
they have breathing problems right sleep
apnea there's something about breathing
that actually helps you sleep if you're
not breathing you're not gonna be able
to sleep certain medications certain
drugs can prevent sleep too many
stimulants like caffeine restless leg
syndrome can keep you up at night
because your your body just cannot relax
if you have pain like in back pain that
can keep you up if you have stress which
is probably one of the biggest causes of
why people can't go to sleep that could
keep you up jet lag is another thing
that can keep you from sleeping now you
can also have a hyperthyroid condition
where your engine is constantly
going too fast that can keep you up now
if you over train when you exercise you
can keep the pulse rate really high and
if you ever train right before bed that
can definitely keep you up especially if
your recovery is not good if you're
exposed to blue light okay as in your
cell phones
or little laptops or computers right
before bed that can keep you up now
eating too late at night especially if
you're grazing and you're snacking on
the wrong things and you're stuffed and
you try to go to sleep that can be
another reason why you're not sleeping
now as we get older we also lose
the sleep hormone called melatonin as
well as serotonin a lot of hormones
don't work quite right and that can
start to
cause us to have less sleep now if
someone doesn't exercise okay and let's
say they were an athlete
okay at one time and they really train
their body so their mitochondria are are
plentiful and now they don't exercise to
use up that energy so they have all this
extra energy when they try to go to
sleep and they just can't get into that
deep sleep why because their body is
trained for exercise and they're no
longer exercising if you're deficient in
vitamin d
that can throw off your circadian
rhythms so there's many different
reasons why someone can't sleep and the
key is finding out what reason you're
not sleeping and then correcting that
now i'm going to give you the top things
you can do to help yourself sleep but i
first want to talk about the sleep
remedies that just do not work that
believe it or not a lot of people are
doing
simply because they're
treating this symptom okay they're not
treating the underlying cause and this
is
what happens in medicine is they don't
go deep enough everything's superficial
they just treat the symptom and they
take another drug
for it will last for 24 hours and then
they take another drug but you really
want to get to that root problem so the
first remedy that doesn't work a lot of
people are doing this is basically
alcohol they'll drink some alcohol late
at night to help them wind down
reduce stress and sleep but the problem
is the
it might help you feel like you're more
relaxed but the alcohol itself actually
causes fragmented sleep it doesn't allow
you to go into the deep delta wave sleep
and this is why when you wake up you
don't feel refreshed so alcohol can even
make you more restless it
really throws off your circadian rhythm
it worsens your ability to breathe and
get oxygen late at night so you're
getting less oxygen and it can even
aggravate something like sleep apnea
because it can relax the muscles in the
back of the throat and that can worsen
sleep apnea so as much as it might
appear to help someone sleep
that alcohol before bed is
not helping you sleep all right number
two
over the counter allergy medication
their antihistamines a lot of people
take them for sleep because they can
help you feel drowsy but there actually
is no data that shows that that drug can
improve your sleep in any way shape or
form it might make you feel a little
drowsy but it doesn't improve the
quality of the sleep and it has side
effects like dry mouth which doesn't
help you sleep and a whole bunch of
other side effects which i'm not going
to get into all right and so the next
remedy that doesn't work for sleep is
something called cbd oil which is a
different chemical than thc cbd is a
chemical marijuana called cannabidiol
and a lot of people take it for pain
control they might take it for anxiety
but as far as sleep goes
there's no significant benefits in fact
you can even worsen sleep and this is
why you cannot use a sleep claim for cbd
oil all right prescription sleep
medications
now there's a lot of different
medications and these medications were
not designed to be used uh for a long
period of time they're only designed to
be used maybe a month but a lot of
people take them
chronically for months and months and
months and they wonder why they keep
needing more and more of that medication
to create the same effect there are a
ton of side effects from waking up
feeling very very
groggy
to increasing your risk of having
daytime sleepiness and then increasing
your risk of getting in accidents
there's been side effects of airway
collapse
sleepwalking and the dependency goes up
so you become more and more dependent on
them and that's not good especially
since over time they become less
effective
with more side effects all right and the
next point i want to bring up is these
sleep tracking tools that you would wear
to bed well they don't help you sleep
all they do is they identify if you're
sleeping or not but they don't tell you
what's causing the sleep problem so
that's not a solution um what about
taking
melatonin now melatonin is a hormone
that's made by the pineal gland and the
problem with taking melatonin is that
there's a percentage of people that have
a side effect of getting insomnia so the
very reason you're trying to take it to
sleep might keep you up at night and the
problem is over time you need more and
more of this dosage and also you're
causing your own pineal gland to not
have to work well you have to realize
that melatonin can be gotten another way
and i should just say this melatonin
tends to go down when your cortisol goes
up so the more stress you have the less
melatonin you're gonna have
so it's not always about increasing
melatonin it's about decreasing cortisol
or stress which i'm going to give you
some tips on but
if you want to increase your melatonin
there's a much better way typically
melatonin is called a darkness hormone
because it's increased when it gets dark
out okay so if you're by your bed and
you have uh on your cell phone like an
hour before bed and you're looking into
this blue light or
on some computer the blue light will
definitely inhibit melatonin okay
but if you wanted to increase your
melatonin you can also do it with
being exposed to the sun a certain part
of the sun's waves are called infrared
okay an infrared which is different than
the ultraviolet
can help you recharge your melatonin and
so being outside being exposed to the
sun
looking at the sun rise or the sunset or
even sitting in front of a fireplace
will give you this infrared type light
that will recharge your melatonin you
can even get infrared from a candle or
an incandescent light but the point is
that infrared can recharge melatonin and
so that's a very very safe way of
increasing melatonin but taking
melatonin tends to cause your own body's
production to go way way down and now
you're dependent on that and many many
many people when they take melatonin
feel groggy when they wake up it doesn't
give you a really refreshed
feeling
so it's best to get your melatonin
naturally all right the next point i
want to bring up about sleep is if you
have sleep apnea okay you can't breathe
that usually comes from um insulin
resistance okay
you need to get on keto and do
intermittent fasting and that is going
to help you because the insulin
resistance problem um which then
increases your insulin causes the back
part of your your sinuses and your
throat to thicken and that's going to
obstruct air
so many people when they get on keto and
do intermittent fasting they can
now breathe better they don't need that
machine that puts air into you
the other key thing to do for sleep
apnea is to take more vitamin d three
and you want to take it right before bed
in fact vitamin d3 greatly helps
put your circadian rhythms back into
rhythm so if you had jet lag or some
problem with your sleep
taking about 10 000 iu's vitamin d3
right before bed is a very wise thing
and you're going to actually go to sleep
and wake up feeling more rejuvenated now
i like to sometimes take that with
either b1 and nutritional yeast right
before bed because
if you're in stress mode and you're
excessively thinking all the time
and you want to turn that off
it just takes some b1 from nutritional
yeast it works like a charm and i
already mentioned when you over train
you do too much exercise late at night
and you have low recovery you're going
to go to bed with your pulse rate just
way too high and try to sleep if your
pulse rate is high it won't work so
that's just another factor to look at
and by the way if you ever want to bring
your pulse rate down
you can take some potassium okay
and that'll bring it right down
now if you're low in potassium because
you just ate a big carbohydrate meal
you may even feel your pulse rate even
hear your pulse rate on the pillow like
boom boom boom boom pounding at an
accelerated rate what you should do is
just quickly take some potassium
and things will calm down so potassium
keeps your pulse rate down and so does
not over training
all right now let's say you experience
stress
so the best way to compensate for over
stress would be to do physical work as
compared to exercise
outside
that's the best thing you can do maybe
one or two hours
you should sleep like a baby
there's some other things you can do too
one is to control your breathing okay
if you start to slow down your breath
i'm not talking about slowing it down
too much i'm just talking about
breathing out at a steady rate
and then breathing in in a steady rate
let's say four seconds so if you were to
breathe out for four seconds count and
breathe in for a four second count and
you balance the inhalation with the
exhalation you're gonna drift off into a
wonderful sleep so sometimes
if i'm trying to sleep and i can't sleep
i will focus on my breath
breathe in slowly
breathe out slowly okay just focus on
your breath because
that will indirectly affect the
something called the autonomic nervous
system and it can pull you out of this
flight or fight
mode which is called your sympathetic
nervous system i mean if you ever think
about it when you're stressed your
breathing is off
and so whether you're in a panic attack
or you have anxiety or you're worrying
if you just slow down your breath or
controlled your breathing breathe in and
out slowly
it can just pull you out of that stress
mode very very nicely and help you sleep
so some key points are get your
breathing regulated physical work or
exercise each day go for long walks in
nature really good avoid the blue light
before bed okay this stuff right here
computer work
use an incandescent light it's certain
lights that you can get versus some of
the fluorescent lights and maybe even
get a red light to give you infrared or
sit in front of your fireplace
or sit in front of a campfire or be out
in the sun so you can generate more
melatonin which is going to be very very
helpful when you try to sleep at night
now if you have not seen my video on
melatonin
this one's a really important one check
it out i put it right here

let's talk about what causes bloodshot eyes vitamin b2 deficiency now if you're deficient
in vitamin b2 your eyes can become not just bloodshot itchy watery
sensitive to light there are other causes as well one would be having a blood sugar issue
because you're consuming too much sugar and your blood sugar comes up and down
that can create a lot of sensitivity around the eyes but it can also cause a vitamin b2 deficiency
other uh signs that you have a D2 deficiency would be that your your lips are cracked chapped
um as well as crack corners around your mouth right through here that's a b2 deficiency i used
to have this and i had no clue that was coming from my diet i just used the the carmex on there
and of course there were certain things in that product that actually pulled oil out
and i always end up with worsening of the chapped lips oily nose is a b2 deficiency
how many kids and teenagers out there have just excessively oily skin a red tongue i'm not just
talking about the normal red but a very bright red swollen tongue migraine headaches can come from a
b2 deficiency but here's the thing that you need to know a vitamin b2 deficiency doesn't normally
occur because you're not consuming enough from your diet it normally occurs because you either
have malabsorption there's some problem in your gut that it doesn't allow you to absorb
it let's say you have irritable bowel syndrome or some inflammation your colon or some type
of issue that doesn't allow it to be absorbed or you're consuming too many refined flour products
as in the bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits and waffles so it's not just about taking a
supplement you have to fix this or this and i put some links down below so you know how to do
either one of these one last point if you're taking birth control pills or you're drinking
too much alcohol that can also create a b2 deficiency before you go if you have a question

so let's talk about the ten pre symptoms of diabetes all right you could have
darkened skin on the folds of your body like armpits groin neck and a lot of
people think that's normal but no it's a pre-diabetic symptom number two your
memory is starting to become an issue you start to look for your car where did I park
where did I put my keys that can definitely be pre-diabetes because what
it does to the brain diabetes in general affects four main areas brain and
nervous system which covers a lot the heart the arteries of the heart the eye
and the kidney okay other than that it leaves everything else alone all right
next one is you're tired after you eat you need a nap after you eat number four
belly fat if you look down you can't see your feet you have belly fat okay five
you can't go a long period of time without being hungry two or three hours
you need a snack and you definitely have carb cravings okay number six slow
healing let's say you had an injury or a wound and it's taking forever to heal
number seven you have frequent urination at night and or you're excessively thirsty
you're always wanting to drink some fluids alright number eight and nine
excuse me dry mouth and itchy and ten blurred
vision but what's fascinating is your sugars might not be high you could have
all of these symptoms and basically have normal sugar it might be a little high
but it's not going to be excessively high and that's what I want to talk
about just briefly what happens way before you get diabetes or prediabetes
as you start out having high insulin and the reason for that is you're doing too
many carbs and you're eating too frequently you're having a lot of snacks
okay so the insulins going to go up and then you're going to develop insulin
resistance okay because too much insulin is toxic on the body so
we have been some resistance that shuts down the entry of insulin but you're
still doing the carbs the cells are not getting the insulin so the feedback
mechanism causes the pancreas to produce more and more insulin a person with
insulin resistance has 5 to 7 times as much insulin as a normal person so we
have a mass amount of insulin so this is kind of a protective mechanism that's
compensating from all the sugar in the diet and that's why you don't see the
high sugar in the blood initially is because the insulin is keeping it down
that's what it does and that goes on for a period of years right until the point
where your pancreas is tired it's done it can't keep doing that work so you
then fail to compensate you fail to block blood sugars now the blood sugar
starts going a little higher okay 100 supposed to be like 80 so it goes to 100
up to 125 this is pre-diabetes okay then give it a
little more time if you don't change your carbohydrate consumption it goes to
126 or greater and then you become officially a diabetic now this is such
an easy problem to solve if you just understand that all of these really are
side effects from too much insulin and too much blood sugar and so why would
anyone not want to do the obvious thing which would be cutting down the
carbohydrates in the diet they don't do that what happens is then they instead
put you on the medication to manage your symptoms until you need stronger and
stronger medication and then eventually even taking insulin or other medications
that raise insulin and then they're going to tell you that the danger of
that is hypoglycemia so then you have to buy glucose tablets so they tell you to
eat more sugar because they don't want you to have low blood sugar well why not
just cut down on the medication so anyway I put some very interesting
videos on blood sugars if you have not seen them check them out they're on this
page right here and thanks for watching

so let's talk about the best exercise for a fatty liver now just realize that
exercise will contribute about 15% of the results of losing fat not just on
the body but out of the liver as well you really need to make sure you drop
your carbs and you've fasting with exercise to maximize the results because
this would be about 85% results if you had choline to your diet that is very
powerful to help strip fat off a liver the problem with the fatty liver is that
you're gonna get inflammation and that's going to create fibrosis or scar tissue
which will then lead to cirrhosis so what we're trying to do is prevent
inflammation and cirrhosis and also get rid of the fat off your liver the cool
thing about the liver is that it's one of the only organs that can completely
regenerate it can take a beating it can bounce back if you give it time the bad
news is it does take some time it may take up to one to three years to get
your liver to where it should be but there's some really cool benefits of
exercise for your fatty liver number one it increases the fat oxidation so it
helps you burn fat off your liver it also will improve insulin resistance
which will automatically help you release more fat and lose more weight
number three there's going to be less conversion of glucose to fat so in other
words when you exercise you're going to be burning off the sugar and then
tapping into the fat as energy and less of the glucose even 24 to 48 hours after
you exercise when you're sleeping number four it can help you reduce inflammation
which not only improves insulin resistance but it can also reduce the
formation of scar tissue or fibrosis and you want to prevent cirrhosis because
once that sets in there's a point of no return where you really can't regenerate
the liver okay so now the question is what type of exercise is best for a
fatty liver guess what any exercise as long as you're exercising and I'm going
put some links down below of several studies and what they found is you can
do high intensity low intensity you can do compound resistant type exercise
weight training vigorous exercise core but there's one exception to this if you
do vigorous exercise higher intensity type exercise for at least two to three
times per week you can lessen the amount of fibrosis that's developing in the
liver but of course fibrosis is different than that liver and what we're
talking about primarily is how to take fat off your liver if you haven't seen
my other videos and what to eat to reduce fat on your liver I put them up

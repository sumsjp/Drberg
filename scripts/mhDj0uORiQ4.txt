i've observed many times where when people get a fever they automatically want to get rid of this
fever and that is a big mistake now let's just kind of give you the basics the normal temperature
of your body should be between 97.8 to 99 degrees fahrenheit or that's 36.5 degrees celsius to 37.2
degrees celsius and this can vary a little bit depending on your age if you're male or female
etc now babies and children generally have a higher temperature it's normal for a newborn
baby to have a temperature of 99.5 fahrenheit or 37.5 celsius and as we age we actually get cooler
someone in their 80s could have a temperature of 93.5 degrees fahrenheit and be completely
normal the problem with that is when they get a fever that temperature could be actually what
is normal for someone that is younger and the purpose of a fever is to fight pathogens to
help you decrease the duration of an infection so if you instantly go to ibuprofen and tylenol
and try to break the fever you're going to end up with the infection a lot longer than you should
also a fever helps mobilize and increase your white blood cells so it's quite fascinating
there's many things to do to speed up this cycle of an infection one is to take the right nutrients
now with children i found if you give them calcium like calcium lactate it seems to help
them overcome an infection very fast and it's been something that i've recommended to reduce fevers
naturally which is really just improving their ability to overcome this infection and in addition
to calcium trace minerals are really important and the other thing that's very important is fasting
apparently when you get an infection you lose your appetite and you should just basically go for a
period of time without eating because that's going to actually strengthen your immune system big time
but let's just kind of go through the different age ranges and when you should call your doctor
if you have an infant younger than three months if the temperature is over 100.4 degrees fahrenheit
you might want to check with your doctor if your child is between 3 months to 3 years if it
goes over 102.2 degrees fahrenheit check with your doctor now between the ages of 4 and 18
if the temperature gets over 104 fahrenheit you might want to check with your doctor and if you're
over 18 and it's over 105 degrees fahrenheit check with your doc but
generally if it's below that i would do things to strengthen the immune system
and not automatically trying to turn off this fever with a medication instead i would recommend
getting in a hot bath wearing a lot of clothes when you go to sleep so you can sweat it off that
always seems to work very very nicely now some interesting points about temperature in general
when a person is lying the temperature of their forehead their eyes and their neck go up
yet the temperature of their nose goes down so the next time when someone is potentially lying to you
go ahead and put your hand on their forehead while they're answering your question is there
anything that you're eating that you shouldn't be eating actually don't mention my name when
you ask that question now when you consume red hot chili peppers your temperature actually goes
up so one thing i like about red hot chili peppers in fact peppers in general any type of peppers not
only can they actually help increase a fever but they're loaded with vitamin c so any hot
and spicy peppers is a very good thing to take when you're going through an infection now this
next one is a bit of a side note um people tend to sleep better in a colder room and generally
when you smoke you increase your temperature and i don't recommend smoking if you have a fever
but the point is when you get a fever you actually want to enhance the fever by staying hot
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system
it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but

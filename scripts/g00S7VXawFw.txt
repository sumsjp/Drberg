let's talk about the best foods to consume for reducing a fibroid a fibroid
is a tumor that's growing on the inside of the uterus and they can sometimes grow in different
parts of the uterus but they could be the size of a pea to the size of a basketball
so the main thing you need to know is you want to avoid foods that cause growth
cheese is filled with hormones and you definitely want to avoid cheese
and that is because milk helps a baby calf grow into a cow so milk has all sorts of growth factors
and of course they make cheese out of milk now soy is another plant that is very estrogenic
so you want to stay away from all versions of soy you want to stay away from anything that increases
estrogen and that includes flaxseed as well now in addition to that you want to
avoid foods that trigger insulin because insulin is a very powerful growth hormone
and of course you'd want to go low carb and low sugar but here are the foods that have
various phytonutrients that can help decrease inflammation decrease fibrosis and decrease
angiogenesis which is the formation of new blood supply to a fibroid so number one berries
number two garlic three cauliflower four tomato five onion six broccoli sprouts seven peppermint
you can do that in a tea or blend in with certain foods number eight shallots which are like these
baby little onions and then we have peanuts which will give you some resveratrol which can also be
found in red wine but the problem with that is the alcohol um doesn't really help you shrink
your fibroids and lastly fasting intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting is probably
one of the most powerful things you can do for fibroids so if you combine that with healthy
keto and make sure you have some of these foods right here i think that would be a perfect plan

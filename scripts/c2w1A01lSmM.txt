so today we're going to talk about asthma and some very interesting things
about asthma that maybe you've never heard before what is asthma it's a
chronic lung inflammatory condition it's really a problem with your immune system
some of the symptoms wheezing coughing chest tightness shortness of breath it's
usually worse at night when you're exercising you're exposed to more air
pollution or being exposed to a certain type of allergies that you have that
trigger the asthma one of the best remedies for asthma is sunshine if your
child has asthma put them outside and have them be
exposed to a lot of Sun that gives them the vitamin D that they need and you'll
see that they'll have less asthma symptoms now look at this 397 thousand
people a year die of asthma that was in 2015 it usually begins when you're
younger before 12 years old the Greek word for asthma means panting okay
exposure to bacteria and early childhood prevents asthma versus living in a hyper
clean environment increases your risk of getting asthma why is that because you
develop your immune system through being exposed to pathogens so you start
developing antibodies so without those antibodies you have a weakened immune
system also there's a decreased risk of getting asthma if you lived on a farm or
you have pets why because there's more exposure to pathogens when you're living
in a farm or you have a pet what increases the risk of getting asthma is
having early antibiotics so you're a young kid and you you keep getting this
infection and your parents put you on an antibiotic over and over and over that
will increase the risk of asthma also if you had a c-section that can increase
the risk of getting asthma by 20 to 80 percent why is that because you're less
exposed to the good bacteria that you need
as a part of your immune system so if you have a child that has asthma I would
definitely get them on a probiotic because the gut health is vitally
important and of course with a lot of vitamin D now it's a pretty interesting
therapy which I like called Buteyko therapy I put a link down below here's
what happens when you have asthma your breathing from the upper chest your
breathing more out of your mouth you're trying to get more air in okay and the
problem with that is that heavy mouth breathing decreases your co2 and that is
not a good thing so when you have decreased co2 in the
lungs you have also decreased oxygen in your
blood because co2 and oxygen work together and what happens when you have
less co2 the oxygen binds tighter with the hemoglobin and it's not released so
start breathing through your nose okay doing that is going to help normalize
the co2 and the oxygen and you want to calm down the breathing you want to
breathe slower and calmer but that's going to stimulate something called the
parasympathetic nervous system because think about it when you're under stress
you activate the sympathetic nervous system and especially even when you
start breathing like that that is going to create a vasoconstriction okay not a
laser dilation but we already have a problem with with air getting to the
lungs and oxygen throughout the body so we want to slow it down you want to
focus on breathing through the nose the diaphragm and that will actually create
a much better effect so anyway I put some links down below check them out and
I'll see you in the next video with another amazing recipe no grains no
sugar totally Keto

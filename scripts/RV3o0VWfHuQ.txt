hey welcome everyone i have a very special guest today um on a book that i wanted to
actually two books that i want to interview this Dr. James DiNicolantonio so welcome thanks for
having me on dr berg appreciate it absolutely i'm guessing that's an italian name right
yes it is indeed just a wild guess so listen um i want to just dive right in um you wrote
a very fascinating book actually too i want to cover the first one first called the salt
fix and that's such a confusing topic to so many people and there's a lot of false information so i
want to pick your brain if you don't mind and get some data on this we've all been told that salt is
bad for us and it causes high blood pressure etc etc um give us some basics on what you found with
salt sure well i think um even back from an evolutionary perspective in the book i talk
about this we've had this preconceived notion that our ancestors ate this very low salt diet
um and these are based on calculations um simply looking at um land muscle meat
so not aquatic vegetation or aquatic animals and not um nose to towel where we would have
consumed the salty blood and interstitial fluid but simply looking at a piece of meat and so
those calculations had put our paleolithic ancestors are consuming about 500 milligrams
of sodium per day but if you look at it from the perspective of consuming nose to tail
and the fact that we would actually follow animals to salt licks and we could consume salt directly
that that's just a complete falsehood and a very low estimation of how much salt we
would have consumed so yeah uh you had a question potentially i was just gonna say like uh i think
what we're told is um a certain amount like how much what what from your viewpoint what is the
um the recommended amount of salt um i guess we can do it in teaspoons it'd be easier or a half
a teaspoon or teaspoon well so the american heart association essentially recommends less
than a half of a teaspoon of salt per day however they also recommend that we should be exercising
an hour per day and we actually lose about a half a teaspoon of salt per hour of exercise
through sweat um and then you have the us dietary guidelines that recommend less than a teaspoon
of salt per day now from actually all the prospective studies the lowest risk of
death or heart attacks is actually a consuming about one and a half teaspoons of salt per day
or about you know 3.4 grams of sodium is essentially where the lowest rates of mortality
cardiovascular disease things like that actually set and not to mention the other big
recommendation is to drink a ton of water right you start drinking more water you have low salts
then you develop hyponatremia and you have a whole series of issues with that alone
you're exercising and sweating right and i mean most of us do are consuming caffeine and i didn't
realize up until a couple years ago how actually caffeine the reason why it causes diuresis is
because it causes us to lose sodium and chloride so it is it causes natural recess so the typical
loss of sodium from four cups of coffee is a half a teaspoon of salt or about 1200 milligrams of
sodium wow i didn't know that that's fascinating so you know all of us are the our java junkies now
are consuming caffeinated sports beverages and it that is slowly depleting you of both sodium and
actually even more chloride for some reason caffeine in coffee is a tremendous chloride
waster about even two times higher than the amount of sodium we lose so the typical athlete
you know who sweats you know half a teaspoon of salt out per hour they're also losing iodine too
through swat so you typically lose about 50 to 100 micrograms of iodine per hour of exercise
and so if you're constantly sweating out salt in iodine and you're never replacing those
things that can lead to hypothyroidism low salt hyponatremia poor exercise talents wow
now um if you're let's say you're a football player and it's it's summer and you're you're
in practice i've heard that um if you're doing some type of intense exercise you could lose up to
six grams of salt or at least sodium per per i guess workout that's like an ungodly amount of
loss of electrolyte that's true so in in the salt fix i actually do cite one study it was um soccer
players in practice in the heat and the goal i believe it was the goalie lost 6 000 milligrams of
sodium in the one hour of practice and i think the average loss was about 1800 milligrams of sodium
per hour but certain individuals can lose you know six grams or six thousand milligrams excuse me
six grams of sodium wow now as far as what people um should be eating and they're let's
say they're concerned about um well there's their doctor said there's certain studies
what does the actual now you mentioned the studies that say well if you consume
at one and a half teaspoons then you start to have issues is that true or just incomplete data
i think um so we have to look at salt which is sodium and chloride from the perspective of
overall dietary intake because if you consume a good amount of potassium bicarbonate fruits
vegetables citrate things that are increasing your alkalinity you can handle and tolerate much
higher levels of salt that's what that's what i was going to bring up yeah it's a huge it's so
people that are salt sensitive typically a are either insulin resistant and you fix their you
know high insulin levels and they they're no longer self-sensitive so it's really they're
sugar-sensitive in a way these people it's just showing up as salt sensitivity or you increase
their potassium magnesium and bicarbonate forming substances either potassium citrate or bicarbonate
and you're going to be able to virtually eliminate salt sensitivity in probably 99 people
that's just a point that i want to bring up because i found that um the great majority of the
population have no idea that they the quantity of potassium need to need so they're usually going to
be under doing it especially if they're you know an average american consumes like one and a half
cups of greens and so now we're going to get low potassium now you're going to have more tendency
to be more sensitive to sodium just because that ratio is not there so you can't buffer it
so i guess they didn't play in they didn't talk about that or study that variable uh with people
i don't know if they looked at the potassium levels when they checked the sensitivity to
salt at all maybe they didn't i don't know right and well that's that's the thing and it's very
difficult to actually find studies testing this out and i do mention a couple in the sulfix
where they actually took these high salt consuming japanese people who had high blood pressure they
were consuming 15 grams of salt so about twice what we typically consume or most people only
consume about 8 grams of salt per day in the united states and they decided to raise their
potassium intake from 3 grams to 7 grams and they kept the high salt intake the same
and it significantly reduced blood pressure essentially to a normotensive state or normal
blood pressure so it goes to show you you can consume a very high salt diet
as long as you get the potassium level fairly high got it um now as far as what
you recommend um that an average consumer should consume how much salt should they be consuming
if someone is eating a whole food diet right so they're not consuming these high refined carbs and
sugars then really that one and a half teaspoons is perfect for someone because when you start
going below three grams of sodium you start to see the increases in the sodium retaining stress
hormones aldosterone renin angiotensin ii that is indicating that your body is in a stressed out
state to retain the salt and so you always want to keep the body in homeostasis and that starts to
separate from homeostasis as soon as you go below three grams of sodium per day so this brings up an
interesting point you're saying or talking about if someone's not consuming enough salt the body
can then start stressing out and activating more adrenal hormones and other hormones right correct
right and even in animal studies this is really interesting if you put them on a low salt diet
they have to continuously secrete the sodium retaining hormone called aldosterone
and that has been shown to lead to hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and that can lead to adrenal
fatigue but it's physiologically you can see it on a hypertrophied adrenal gland from a low salt diet
so you can see that this would play out in humans as well if you're constantly pushing out
10 times the amount of aldosterone because you're on a low salt diet that can potentially
hypertrophy the adrenal glands and lead to adrenal burnout wow is there any data that shows that
doing a low sodium diet can trigger increased cortisol that's a good that's a good question
i don't know not sure but i would assume that it would because you are stressing the body out
and cortisol helps retain salt a little bit but it's what i call the the sodium releaser
in the body um it has if you are stressed out and you're trying to run away from a lion
the cortisol helps the body to release the sodium increase blood volume so you can run longer
well aldosterone is the salt store so it helps you store now when someone has a condition
where they're completely shot their adrenals are shot and they have the condition called
addison's where they don't have any more adrenal function then they they have to consume salt like
24 7 right because they have a hold of bucket there's no retention of that salt
right i actually in this in the salt fix i have this unique story it was a child that was
constantly raiding the um the kitchen cabinet and just consuming just ungodly amounts of salt and
the the mother was obviously concerned and they hospitalized this child not realizing that the
child had salt wasting kidney disease and the child ended up dying because they essentially
restrained the child on the bed from being able to go and get the salt that his body was telling
him he needed and so right you're correct when you start losing the cortisol and the adrenal hormone
functions then you're going to start wasting more salt yeah interesting um what about you you
mentioned this briefly i want to know a little bit more about insulin resistance so you take
a typical person who's insulin resistant um they want to get on keto uh if you're insulin resistant
um you have do you have a problem retaining salt or you just can't absorb it or what happens
so typically if you're if you haven't damaged the kidneys which can cause salt wasting
and you're sort of maybe early on or middle stage in your insulin resistance
it's causing you to over attain salt um and essentially that's because as insulin levels
increase it tells the kidneys to hold on to more sodium so as soon as you drop the high refined
carbohydrate intake and lower the insulin levels your kidneys will then start flushing yourself
out of salt and typically most salt sensitive people become fixed once they do that this is why
you see diabetics uh have these swollen ankles and they're just filled with fluid like crazy
right they're just holding they're like a a water water log basically they are they are water logged
and it's also due to the elevation glucose because glucose also has an osmotic effect as well like
sodium it pulls fluid out of the cell into the plasma volume so we have so we have
that effect and then we also have the storage of glucose as glycogen you store three molecules of
fluid or water for every one molecule of glycogen so there's a there's a lot of different dynamics
happening that you're holding fluid so that's fascinating um as far as the quality of um salt um
what type of salt do you recommend of course i'm guessing it's not going to be table salt
yeah i mean i do appreciate the the pink salts yeah because they contain natural iodine so the
biggest question they get is if someone purchases a pink salt it'll say not a good source of iodide
d e and that's because they're not artificially adding iodide to the salt it just naturally
contains iodine so the fda makes them state that it is not a good source of iodine
but your pink salts do contain natural amounts of iodine in fairly clinically significant amounts so
i like either the original himalayan pink salt which um seems to have about 25 micrograms of
iodine per 10 grams of salt and uh redmond real salt which their mineral analysis indicates 170
micrograms of iodine per 10 grams of salt so depending on if you are sweating a lot and
if you're not getting a lot of iodine in the diet maybe a redmond is a better salt for you
if you are someone who already gets a lot of iodine you're eating a lot of pastured eggs
you're drinking their uh milk or eating cheese and you're not sweating a whole lot maybe a
lower either in salt pink's himalayan salt would be better interesting um if someone's going to
do a ketogenic diet and they want to consume one and a half teaspoons and they're you know they're
they're sprinkling on their food but then they're short so do you recommend just putting some salt
in some water dissolving it and drinking it or how would you recommend to consume that salt
it depends on the person i i've noticed that some people like to take salt straight and then wash
blew it down whereas some other people like to take it as a shot or they'll put a little bit of
lemon juice a little bit of water maybe just one ounce and just take it like a quick shot it really
depends on the person and i think you know it also depends on your activity level too because
if you're going if you're someone who works out intensely for an hour per day
you probably want to get a half a teaspoon of salt in you
you know 60 minutes before the workout to boost blood volume boost performance reduce hyponatremia
interesting when someone goes on a ketogenic diet and they lose all this fluid
and they don't take enough salt what are some of the top symptoms that they're going to get
that's a good question um based on the clinical studies we know that it leads to sleep disturbance
fatigue and erectile dysfunction based on actual people that i've talked to um
the most emails that i've gotten like a couple hundred emails have been people that have had afib
and just added back salt and it instantly went away their atrial fibrillation i've gotten the
most emails about that so i'm not saying that that can um do that for your individual case but
um for some reason salt is obviously is important for conductivity electrical
impulses that seems to be a big driver and it could be due to the fact that salt
controls magnesium when you don't get enough salt you start to pull sodium but also magnesium
and calcium from the bone and that can lead to negative magnesium and calcium balance if you're
low in salt and so simply adding the salt back can also fix magnesium deficiency if you're pulling
it from the bone and then muscle cramps exercise intolerance are very common symptoms but dizziness
going from a seated to a standing position as well is very common and then muscle cramps too
yes i i've noticed just from also talking with like hundreds of people uh muscle weakness do
you feel weaker i guess that would be kind of a fatigue but you feel kind of weak and then
you take salt and just kind of come right up you feel stronger obviously you you need i mean in all
your cells you have not only the sodium potassium pump but you have um sodium interaction between
your nervous system and the muscles i mean there's a it's a required electrolyte obviously
yeah sodium sodium allows you to pull glucose into the cell amino acids into the cell it
allows you to get acid out of the cell it allows almost every single neurotransmitter to be moved
in and out of the cells of the brain it allows you to absorb vitamin c and put vitamin c into
the brain into the adrenal glands into the bone you can actually induce osteoporosis in animals
by simply lowering their sodium level in the blood preventing vitamin c from getting into the bone so
it's really interesting sodium is the universal molecule that is used to move almost any single
substance in the body fascinating now let's switch to chlorides so you get sodium chloride
as far as building up your stomach acids for example making hydrochloric acid if you're low on
chlorides what type of problems could occur almost any nutrient deficiency would happen then because
you need that stomach acid to in order to digest your food and then in order to absorb nutrients so
you can see things like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or a lot of bloating if you don't have
good stomach acid which could be due to a low salt intake and this has actually been tested
out in studies people have gone from a normal salt intake to a low salt intake and it's significantly
reduces the the acid in the stomach and raises the ph of the stomach so it's important to keep a very
acidic stomach and you cannot make chloride we can't synthesize it you have to get it by
eating salt fascinating that's awesome well that's awesome so let's switch to your your other book
that actually was co-authored by uh sim land which uh he came to my summit uh the last last year um
it's called the immune fix so tell us a little bit about that book in very simple layman's terms i
know it's you're giving a lot of uh natural things but give us a little bit more data on that book
so the immunity fix was borne out by some of my publications in the
academic literature i was trying to figure out what potential nutraceutical strategies
may help against rna viruses including coronavirus and we actually published a probably the first
review paper in february it was press release by elsevier on this on this potential strategy
and then i said you know i need to really turn this into a book because nobody reads academic
literature and it ended up turning into this 2500 referenced sort of like bible on immunity
but in in essence and we're really not being told this and you know by you know the common process
is that you are in control of your own immune health and how healthy you are metabolically and
how your nutrition status is can directly determine how well you can fight off viruses
and i'll give you a really great example of this there's a virus an rna virus called coxy virus
and in some kids it causes hand foot and mouth and in most people it doesn't cause anything
you don't even know you have it but if you're deficient in just one mineral selenium it causes
ketone disease which leads to cardiomyopathy and death and you treat those people who have
this rna viral infection that are dying by simply giving them selenium because selenium is important
for your antioxidant status right increasing glutathione thought making thyroid hormones
so it goes to show you that your resilience which depends on your metabolic health and
your nutrient status directly determines how well you are going to handle any type of virus
the elephant in the room is that there's a huge huge omission with this whole coveted
situation going on it's like there's no no real focus on building up your own immune system
which is ultimately your greatest protection instead it's all about avoiding this pathogen
and trying to stay clean and be sterile but it's it's a huge missing thing and i know in your
book that you go into uh major details so this book is also really good for people that are um
uh unders want to know all the details um i mean your immune system also needs salt and chlorides
as they're they use that as part of their weapons to kill off certain things and so um
so you cover that in great great depth um one quick question about viruses in general um
in your book you get a lot more into it but what what is what is like
maybe the top nutrient that someone needs to focus on more if if they're concerned about
a weak immune system and viral protection i would say the two nutrients because they're
very highly linked is magnesium and vitamin d and so you have one billion people globally
that are vitamin d deficient and half the global population is vitamin d insufficient so and that
increases if you are severely d deficient that increases your risk of dying from cova 19 by 15
fold and you can't change how old you are but you can certainly fix your vitamin d levels
um and then magnesium is required to activate vitamin d in the body of these hydroxylase enzymes
and about 50 of the us population is deficient in magnesium so taking those two together are very
important for maintaining a healthy immune system see i thought i thought you're going to say zinc
but but when you said magnesium you're basically you're telling me that um which makes sense
magnesium is required for vitamin d so without vitamin d if was that that's like your weak thing
so if you're low on magnesium the vitamin d really won't work that well right all
so i think what you're saying is like vitamin d is like the pinnacle the most important thing because
it's like the immune modulator
well right and you have these vitamin d receptors on almost all of your immune cells and in order
to activate those you have to form the active hormone called calcitriol and once calcitriol
binds to those receptors you can get you fix sort of like these over active inflammation when you do
that but in order to get the calcitriol you need the magnesium to convert d to the active hormone
what about um some of the worst foods that someone should avoid for their immune system probably the
worst would be the omega-6 seed oils and not only from the fact that they're highly oxidized and you
form more oxidation products in the acidity of your stomach when you consume these oils
which is very damaging to the gut and then you don't absorb nutrients once you damage the god
but the fact that omega-6 will actually get into almost every single immune cell and once you start
saturating your immune cells with omega-6 they start producing more pro-inflammatory cytokines so
that would be the number one thing to avoid is the corn oil right safflower soybean oils that a lot
of people are cooking with absolutely um and then of course uh then on the flip side maybe omega-3
would be good to take as well right yeah so many people are deficient in omega-3s and that helps
to form these you know pro-resolvents that help result literally this is how our body resolves
inflammation it's utilizing things like epa and dha and forming these these substances called
resolvence and protectants and it's essentially how our body heals from inflammation well this
has been an incredible interview everyone's going to love this data i put both of your links down
below for both of your books and i highly suggest you guys get these two books they're fascinating
one is called the salt fix and the other one is called the immunity fix because it's all
about just gaining knowledge to not just about you know treating symptoms but getting rid of
getting to the core getting to the cause so thank you so much for your time thanks for having me on

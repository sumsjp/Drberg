hi guys in this video we're going to talk about how to deal with rough pimply skin okay the
medical term is follicular hyperkeratosis okay I just thought you might want to know that so
this condition is really simply a vitamin A deficiency vitamin A has the capacity being
a fats I love vitamin to penetrate the wall of the cell to go deep into the DNA of yourself and
it can help differentiate what cells turn into whether it's a skin cell a normal skin cell or
an abnormal skin cell so that's why it's coming out kind of rough around the little molecules on
the hair so it's a vitamin A deficiency so the question is like why would you be deficient in
vitamin A well it could be that you're a vegan and you're not doing animal products because
here's the problem with that the true vitamin A is retinol retinol comes from animal products
you can convert vitamin A from kale for example or spinach but you're only getting a small percentage
like 4% so you're not going to get as much that could be the cause the other cause could be the
most common one is a gallbladder problem you don't have enough bile because you're getting
bloated you have digestive issues I'm just going to put a link down below because that's a common
issue for a lot of people because here you're taking by the vitamin A it's not going in because
you can't emulsify it or break down that facile vitamin now it also could be an iron deficiency
vitamin A deficiency and iron deficiencies always seem to come together and they work together too
alcohol can cause this deficiency liver problems can cause this problem if you have you have the
hepatitis or cirrhosis or a fatty liver that could be what you need to work on and again
I'll put some videos down below if you suspect that we need to deal with the liver the remedy
is to take vitamin a virgin cod liver oil is the best vitamin a source and either that's going to
work or it's not going to work if it's not going to work then you need to work on your digestion
because your liver or your gallbladder is not pulling it in omega-3 is also it has essential
fatty acids that are also important for the skin and that a deficiency of omega-3 can cause
and this could be also like a digestive issue of celiac or irritable bowel syndrome or leaky gut
or some type of digestive issue and you're not able to absorb omega-3 fatty acids so that could
be why and vitamin E again that usually comes from unrefined grains or actually it comes from
vegetables as well but if you're consuming refined grains breads pasta cereal crackers things like
that you're going to deplete your vitamin E and then you're going to create this skin issue so
you probably want to change your diet on that one or it could be exposure to arsenic now where does
that come from right well if you're sometimes certain vegetables believe it or not that are
commercial they use arsenic based substance for as a as a way to kill them microbes so again that's
why you need to go more organic to avoid some of these harsher chemicals all right so go ahead

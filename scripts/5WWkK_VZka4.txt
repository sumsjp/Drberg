hey guys in this video I'm going to talk about something that's very very
important I'm going to talk about arthritis both osteoarthritis and
rheumatoid arthritis so you if you have either one of these watch this entire
video it's going to change your life now you maybe you've heard of like maybe
your grandmother recommending chicken soup or some folklore that chicken soup
actually helps your arthritis well it actually does and it's been
scientifically proven but not from the vegetables and I'm going to go through
like why it works here's the thing let's let's just say there's a chain of events
that occur in someone's life and sometimes you see people in their 50s or
60s or 70s all of a sudden out of the blue they lose their joint like their
hip joint or their knee joint like just bone on bone for no reason they're not
jogging they didn't really have a major injury maybe they did as a child but not
as an adult why does that joint disappear and it can happen in the
shoulder as well well here's how it works let's say you're a kid and you
fall on your knee or your hip and you Jam the joint and you create a little
bit of a micro tear well what happens small tiny pieces of that joint can leak
into the joint it's the space the synovial fluid in there and your own
body's immune system will recognize that as a foreign material and start to build
up things that are going to attack it because it thinks it's a foreign body so
it's going to build up antibodies which is against the body to attack these
particles and let's say you but it doesn't necessarily get activated until
you get maybe in your 40s or 30s when you have maybe some stress or I'll loss
and bam the whole thing kicks in there the whole cascade of things occurs
because you have this chain reaction where you have tissue your own body's
tissue leaking into the joint maybe even the bloodstream
the immune system building up anybody's towards it and now you develop what's
called an auto autoimmune disease or autoimmune condition I like to call
it where your that means your body is attacking itself so your own immune
system is attacking because now it not only thinks this is bad it thinks the
whole joint is bad so you have constant inflammation right that's why people
take steroids prednisone because those are anti-inflammatories but behind it
underneath it there's an autoimmune thing going on and so over time your
immune system will literally destroy that joint and that's how it works so
many people have that condition they don't even know what's going on all
right now what do you do about it why does chicken soup help that well
it's not the vegetables what is in chicken soup
you actually have collagen you have cartilage in the chicken soup small
amounts and it's not that you have to eat that collagen to build up your own
collagen that will never ever work it has to do with several research studies
they've done recently and in the past in fact this guy named Royal Lee back in
1940 found out how to do this well before you see the current researchers
making these different studies and showing the same principle they found
that if you ingest cartilage from a chicken it goes through the body and it
acts as a decoy so very simply I'm going to try to make this really simple you
could actually take a piece a small amount of a chicken cartilage which is
basically identical to your cartilage so there's no difference between the
College of a chicken and the cartilage of your body okay your joints so you
take this little piece of collagen okay or cartilage it goes in your stomach and
it gets digested and it goes through your lymphatic system which is
immigration so it gets the stamp of approval through immigration that's how
it works and so what happens is your antibodies
are going to sense that there's cartilage in your stomach so these
antibodies are going to be redirected to the stomach and this solution is very
very amazing strategic-wise because by adding this decoy allows the joint
inflammation to go way down to the point where this can start to heal now if you
have bone and bone it's probably too late but if it's starting to wear out
I'm highly recommending you do this you can find this collagen or cartilage
online or any health food store has it it's called undie natured type 2
collagen or you see - that's what you want to get I don't recommend any brand
I don't sell it you can just find it anywhere ok so you start taking this in
your stomach it'll start to over time slowly deplete your antibody Reserve
that has been attacking your joints and when you start to deplete all these
antibodies you have a lot less inflammation your joints and you can
start to heal so it's an amazing strategy but I want to explain why it
works because it's acting as a decoy now if you notice when they recommend to
take this it's always before bed why because if you take a little too much
you can create a little bit of an immune reaction but it's really only some
fatigue or some achiness okay that's the worst case scenario and that's why if
you take before you go to bed you probably just sleep it off in your sleep
deeper and you won't even know it okay but if you don't understand what's
happening you might say wow I might be allergic to those pills and that may be
worse where I feel more achy after taking it I better avoid that no it's
working it's just working too fast does it make sense so if you have an immune
reaction when you take this take the capsule in half and only take half and
take it right before bed an empty stomach so you don't confuse all these
different proteins especially protein and you take one of these before bed and
within about if you have like a mile Teague you'll sleep better and you maybe
a little bit more tired the next day but you just keep doing that keep doing it
every day for about a week or two and you'll adjust to that you won't have any
more reactions to that and then you want to continue to take this until all the
inflammation is gone from your joints it's an amazing simple safe solution
I love the strategy because there's no side effects and it's been totally
substantiated by numerous studies and I'm going to put the links below but
this is the relationship so yes you can do chicken soup but the under natured
type two collagen under natured means completely undestroyed so it's not
cooked it's not heated so you get the exact collagen that you need that goes
in there and I think it's going to work better than chicken soup but apparently
this is going to give you some collagen or cartilage and that's why that works
to reduce inflammation all right so go ahead and try it and let me know how it
works I'll see you the next video

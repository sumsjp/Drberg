I wanted to create a quick video on using caffeine for a hair loss okay now
I'm not saying that you should pour a cup of coffee on your head but what I am
saying there's a real interesting bit of research on the effects of caffeine on
stimulating hair follicle growth on countering the suppression of this
hormone called DHT let me explain that right now so DHT is a very powerful form
of testosterone and it's known that high levels of this powerful testosterone can
cause hair loss so a lot of people take this this thing right here it's a it's
an enzyme inhibitor that will reduce this and either take it in a drug form
or a natural form and that will actually block this from happening so they won't
lose your hair and that's what I'm talking about right here where caffeine
actually counters the suppressive action of DHT DHT is blocking and suppressing
hair growth so caffeine will counter that and number three caffeine actually
will stimulate faster growth so the question is how do you apply the
caffeine to your skull they're actually caffeinated shampoos you can find them
online and use that you might want to try it there's some interesting research
on it I put the link down below one of the reasons why you might see older men
or even women with hair loss has to do with their free testosterone going down
because what happens when you get older certain testosterone decreases from 30
to 60 percent and in men they can develop hypogonadism and they can have
all sorts of problems that come along with low testosterone a lack of muscle
growth a lack of strength and if you know someone that has that also tell
them about zinc and zinc is very very important in helping to regulate
testosterone if you haven't seen my other videos in hair loss I put them up
right here

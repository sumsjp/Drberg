hey guys I'm back again and in this video we're going to talk about is ketosis more of a low carb
diet or is it more of a high-fat diet when you talk to people and you mention ketosis
sometimes they freak out because oh yeah you're you're in a high-fat diet you're going to clog
your arteries but let's just kind of dig into actually what makes up keep ketogenic diet or
what puts you into ketosis it's not the high fat if you just went on a high-fat diet you
wouldn't necessarily get into ketosis it's the low carbohydrate because when you actually get
rid of carbohydrates and cut it down to 5% of your total calories you force your body to switch the
fuel to burn more fat okay so in the absence of insulin an absence of sugar glucose carbohydrates
your body is then forced to burn more fat so if you keep your carbohydrates very low you have to
make it up with other things now if you actually made it up with protein and had mass amounts of
protein unfortunately that also will trigger insulin okay so then we're left with fat so
when we talk about high fat we're talking about 70 to 75% of your total calories need to be fat
now before you freak out let's just talk about what that is because it's not that much really
so let's just take an average of 1,800 calories let's say you're on an eating plan that roughly
is about 1,800 calories per day okay 70 to 75% of those calories would come out to 120 grams of fat
if we divided by three we get 40 grams of fat per meal all right now what does that come out to is
that a lot well let's just take a look we combine 3/4 of an avocado which basically is 22 grams of
fat and combined peanut butter two tablespoons that comes out to 38 grams of fat that's not
that much okay like in your mind you might think you're eating a huge cup of lard and bacon and
cheese and all these other things but really you're not let's take a look at 1/2 a cup of
almonds with 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil in your salad that's 46 grams of fat that's more than
40 grams let's take let's say we mix olive oil with pecans 1/4 of a cup of pecans which is 25
grams plus 21 grams that's 46 grams of fat so it's not that much so really 70 to 75% of your total
calories being fat grams is actually not as much as you think ok so I just wanted to point this out
just to give you some reality and some relative value of what you're dealing with but the key is
keeping the carbs low alright thanks for watching hi guys and hey listen I created a pretty amazing

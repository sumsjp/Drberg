if you have an autoimmune condition you need to know this information in this video i've done
other videos on this topic but you may have not seen them so i want to do another one specifically
on this one point so more and more people can understand the mechanism behind autoimmune
diseases and an autoimmune condition is a condition where your body has developed antibodies
against itself so it's a self-attack now there's a lot of unknowns about autoimmune conditions but
there's definitely something that they know based on a lot of research and all the data that i talk
about is going to be in links down below and you should definitely research this yourself
there's something called a th17 which stands for t helper 17 cell this is part of your immune system
it's a specialized cell and it does some real interesting things which we'll get into but this
is what they know about autoimmune conditions an autoimmune condition is an over activation
of the th17 cell okay so if that cell is dysregulated and it's working too much
you're at risk for getting rheumatoid arthritis ms lupus
psoriasis and even asthma now asthma typically is not classified as an autoimmune condition
but there's some data that says that it is an autoimmune condition so it's right in
that category and allergies in general even though allergies are not an immune condition
involve the t helper 17 cell and as a side note hiv involves having an under activation of the
t helper 17 cell in fact part of the immune system specifically the t helper cells which regulate the
entire immune system is pretty much dysfunctional in hiv so the problem in autoimmune conditions the
real problem is the chronic inflammation that's what creates all the collateral damage and it's
caused by your own immune system so the th17 cell modulates and prevents autoimmune diseases and so
if you have an over activation you're going to have a problem with autoimmune diseases
now vitamin d is a direct inhibitor of the th17 cell and also they use it as treatment
for th17 mediated diseases so vitamin d in high doses i'm talking about at least 40,000 IUs
are essential in autoimmune diseases also there's a lot of data that i'm going to put a link down
below that involves with using natural things for decreasing the inflammatory pathways like
curcumin small chain fatty acids that's when you consume fiber your microbes make those fatty
acids and also sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables all very good for inflammation
and then the fasting mimicking diet there hasn't been a lot of research on fasting which i would
highly recommend for this these conditions but there is some great data on the fasting mimicking
diet which you're mimicking fasting because you're having very small amount of calories
so vitamin d these natural remedies are all very very important if you have an autoimmune condition
look up the t helper 17 cell in relationship to vitamin d and some of these other natural
remedies and i think that can really help you before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

so let's talk about what causes the clubbing
appearance of your nail where the nail becomes thickened it becomes enlarged
it starts to create a little bit of a convexity
as it enlarges right here so this is the appearance of a club nail
but what's behind it well there's several things that it could be
one would be related to the heart you have maybe a hypoxic condition where
you're just not getting enough oxygen and it's showing up in the nails
and there's another condition which is genetic involving
the structural part of the heart and because you're born with that you're
going to develop this appearance early on also the lung
if there's a condition called sarcoidosis or
you had tb that could create this appearance
now you could also have a problem in your
gut malabsorption where you're not able to pull in
the fat-soluble vitamins or vitamins in general
that can create that appearance it could also come from
a type of thyroid condition called graves
which is a hyper thyroid condition and it's an autoimmune condition
and lastly it could come from your liver so if you have cirrhosis
or it could be fibrosis or scar tissue of the gallbladder or the little ducks
they're called bile ducts and that can create a big problem with
the liver which can affect all sorts of nutrient issues
as well as structural problems throughout the body not just the nail
it can create hair problems and skin issues and as a side note
a very good remedy for this would be bile salts by the way that actually will
help reverse some of this fibrosis now i put some links down below for each
item right here if you want more information and if you haven't seen my

so today we're going to talk about an amazing diet it's called a tapeworm
diet and i saw some ads for it i want to read these ads to you
very interesting claims here's one get rid of life-threatening fat without
exercise dieting or surgery that's
that's pretty exciting here's one lose weight the easy way
try lard be gone now with live tapeworm eggs here's another one
the amazing tapeworm diet eat anything and never
get fat doctors call it the amazing tapeworm diet
the all-natural cure for obesity finally i've been waiting for this for a long
time here's one eat eat eat and always stay
thin fat banished sanitize tape
worms let's talk about the pros and cons and
realize that this diet's been going on for a long time it's not a new diet
eat whatever you want no dieting no depriving because the tape worm
eats the extra calories so you can lose weight
and feel great there are some slight minor
complications to this diet some cons you may not lose weight
until you remove the parasite because as the parasite eats
it grows and it has weight as well so you'll eventually lose weight once
the parasite comes out maybe not during the process of it
growing lake fishing can be fun here's another
con it may increase your appetite especially for carbohydrates
all right the next con is that the tapeworm diet
is really a tapeworm infection so you may experience some
side effects pain in your abdominal area you might get a fever
maybe a couple skin lesions some rashes fatigue
maybe some diarrhea bloating but other than that you're going to be
doing pretty good because you're going to be losing weight eventually
now there's a couple more complications one being
removing the parasite how you're going to remove it
you can do it surgically or you can do with medication
the problem is the medication has some side effects too
brain swelling neurological issues dementia potential seizures
but other than that i think you'll be totally fine and the last complication
is you can't really control where that parasite attaches
if it gets outside the intestine it can go
into your organs and attach to certain organs so that could create some other
complications but other than these right here
listen you can eat whatever you want no dieting no
deprivation so tell me your thoughts and considerations of this diet in the

hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about ovarian
cysts and fibrocystic breasts now a cyst is a fluid-filled sac and we're going to be
talking about cysts more in women's bodies not in men's bodies in this video
there are two main reasons why women get cysts on the breast and the uterus on
the ovary in other places and it has to do with either estrogen dominance
because estrogen actually make things get bigger or an iodine deficiency okay
iodine is considered an anti estrogen ik mineral so it decreases the estrogen
excess in the body so chances are if you have these cysts it could either be that
you don't have enough iodine or you have a massive amount of estrogen because
iodine counters the estrogen and it's really difficult to get iodine in the
diet especially in America because the soils are very depleted with trace
minerals and this is a trace mineral unless you're doing a lot of seafood or
seaweed you're probably deficient in iodine okay
now you might think of iodine for the thyroid right well most of the iodine in
the body is stored as alright but the second place it's stored is in the ovary
and the uterus in the third place it's in the breast
so basically iodine is important for all the female reproductive organs and if
there is a cycle a menstrual cycle that spikes ask too much estrogen you have
estrogen dominance that cysts can start growing either when you're ovulating or
when you're actually menstruating and that's why a lot of women get back pain
during that time usually on the right side of the left side of the back or the
hip because it can refer pain to the sacroiliac joints on one side so if you
have pain on the right side of your lower back
chances are it's the right ovary that has a cyst all right very simple remedy
I recommend just take some iodine I like to take it from sea kelp sea kelp is a
plant-based mineral and you can just take a little bit take it in the morning
and gradually increase it until the symptoms of cysts go away okay
and that helps balance the estrogen as well it protects you against estrogen
dominance the one I carry is a 100% certified organic sea kelp from Iceland
it's a very clean sea kelp but if you can find a similar brand you can do that
as well in summary if you have these conditions is either too much estrogen
or not enough iodine thanks for watching I'll see you the next video hey guys

hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about how to burn
belly fat step-by-step now in a lot of other videos I talk about specific parts
of weight loss how to burn fat all different aspects in this video we're
going to put everything together okay there's really three basic sections the
basics of what to do things to add the speed up weight loss and things to avoid
to speed up weight loss okay so let's talk about the basics first and some of
this might be just repetitive but if you've never seen a video from me this
will be very helpful make notes and I'll put videos down below for a lot of the
summaries of other videos that you can get detailed information on each thing
because I've probably done videos on each separate item basics two to three
meals a day okay you can start with three meals and then we you want to go
to two you don't want to graze all day because every time you eat you spike
this hormone that prevents weight loss called insulin okay so eating in general
will stimulate that so we want minimum three meals a day or maximum through
three wheels and three meals a day minimum two meals a day so some people
go to two and I'll get more into that when we get into this next part right
here which is no snacking so when you have six meals a day or five meals a day
and they're small and they're spread out or you're snacking between meals you're
going to spike insulin we don't want to do that that's going to create a big
problem for you so removing the snacking is vital very very important
it's called intermittent fasting okay now right here I suggest you start with
three meals and then do that for a while get into ketosis or fat-burning and then
go to two meals if you can do it unless you can't do it because you're working
out hard and you need three meals a day I would say it's 5050 if you're
sedentary you can get by with two meals a day and you will lose some serious
weight in your midsection insulin is the hormone that is responsible for the
midsection weight so three meals no snacking okay far as protein three to
six ounces based on your size your stress level you're gonna need a little
more protein you don't want to go too much because too much protein
will stimulate insulin okay three to six ounces per meal now if you're not hungry
for protein let's say for dinner then don't eat it so but this is kind of an
average now next one seven cups of veggies why because we need to flesh out
all this fat that's going to be coming out to your liver all the fat through
the body has to go through the liver and if you don't consume enough vegetables
you can end up with a fatty liver plus vegetables give us the potassium we need
we need about forty seven hundred milligrams that's a lot so that's about
seven to ten cups very few people do that but you want to
consume the vegetable first and have a huge salad and then a small amount of
protein now next one is no sugar this is a given because sugar increases insulin
and also I'm talking about the hidden sugars the breads pasta cereal crackers
biscuits waffles pancakes muffins alcohol okay so we want to cut the sugar and
refined carbs out next one healthy fats this is essential because when you
consume fat at the end of the meal that allows you to go to the next meal
without being so hungry in craving and starving that your blood Sugar's crash
so this basically allows you to do three meals or two meals without being hungry
thereby not increasing insulin fat is one of the only things that does not
increase insulin it's neutral so this is safe if you're worried about calories I
put some links down below okay these are the basics now if we want to speed
things up we can add some MCTS to the diet that's like in coconut oil medium
chain triglycerides that will increase fat burning next one is potassium why
because at the heart of weight loss we want to avoid insulin and so most people
that can't lose weight have too much insulin they have insulin resistance so
we want to fix that potassium is one of the ways to do that you can consume all
these vegetables or even take it in some supplement potassium citrate to actually
heal the aberration or dysfunction of insulin next thing is apple cider
vinegar why because the acid in apple cider vinegar called acetic acid
does improve the output of insulin it reduces insulin it improves insulin
resistance it lowers your blood sugars so it's very good for diabetics and take
this one in the morning one teaspoon with a glass of water and one before bed or
four with your dinner if you have digestive issues very important chromium
again you can find a supplement from ham to help your blood sugars chromium is a
mineral that actually has been proven to help insulin again keep it in check B
vitamins another key thing especially vitamin b1 for regulating insulin
control and improving insulin resistance nutritional yeast is your go-to okay
next one is high-intensity interval training if you add high-intensity
full-body resistance training you're gonna spike growth hormone and
you're gonna speed up weight loss the key is short bursts of high-intensity
lots of rest okay again I'll put some videos down below to get specifics on
that but this one is this will just this is the icing on the cake okay next one
is more sleep adding more sleep why because growth hormone is triggered when
you're sleeping and that is the primary hormone that stimulates fat burning so
more sleep so if you could just take another take a nap sleep in longer get
an extra hour of sleep that goes a long way that's more important than
high-intensity interval training sleep is the key okay now next one is recovery
making sure that if you are doing high-intensity interval training that
you're recovering after you're not doing it every day some people need to do it
every other day some people every third day some people once a week depending on
how you feel when you work out you're fairly broken down then you get your
overtraining okay so recovery is essential if you're
exercising now let's take a look at what you need to remove this is just as
important as this okay remove any type of sleeping issues
insomnia vital why because you're not going to lose weight if you're not
sleeping all right I put a video down below of what to do if you're not
sleeping there's a lot of things you can do it's mainly stress
loading if you're bloating let's say you're consuming too much kale or too
much you know cruciferous vegetables that you're not used to consuming and
then you're bloating that is going to slow down weight loss so you're gonna
have to go back to the vegetables that you can digest and maybe even steam some
until the bloating goes away also people consume too many nuts that
can create bloating again we want to eliminate anything that bloats you
sometimes adding more apple cider vinegar or an acidifier for the stomach
will help it or even a bile salt your hub also they'll put some links down
below for bloating okay menstrual cycle issues if your cycle is two weeks out of
the month you're not going to lose weight because the high levels of
estrogen estrogen blocks the thyroid estrogen crates fat on the hips and the
thighs and we need to handle this cycle so it's really smooth again I put a link
down below of what to do for that this is kind of like a little bit of an
assessment for you to see what areas you have problems with okay some of these
don't apply ok stress mainly you want to get a list of all the people you know
that stress you out and avoid them for a while you want to avoid the news you
want to avoid stressful situations you want to do certain activities I
recommend an acupressure for your body to pull stress out you wanna do
everything you can do to enhance the reduction of stress because cortisol is
triggered and cortisol will stop your weight loss so I will put some links
down below alright msg what is that monosodium
glutamate that's in a lot of foods start looking at the labels it's in oh my gosh
it's in even cottage cheese that's unless it's organic it's in all the
fast-food restaurants I mean all their foods it's in Chinese foods but it's
hidden as modified food starch okay I got I'll put a video down there at very
important restaurant foods you don't know what you're getting it's a
crapshoot there's so many things they put in that food that you have no idea
and primarily hidden sugars msg to make it taste better but inevitably people go
out to dinner way too much and that is what's keeping him from
losing weight not to mention where do they bring you they bring you bread they
bring you dessert they bring you alcohol okay so it's really difficult to do this
when you're going to restaurants next one is a avoid overtraining
if you're at a bootcamp or you're working out too hard and you're not
recovering and you're not sleeping you're not going to lose weight you're
gonna lose muscle mass so this is very very important especially when you start
out because you're not used to it last thing is constipation I have people that
don't even go like maybe they go once a week or once every two weeks that is a
serious constipation problem and that is going to stop your weight loss again I
have a lot of videos on getting to the root cause of that okay
I'll put them down below so I just kind of summarize all the things that you
need to look at in order to lose your stomach it's comprehensive now you have
the video as a checklist go ahead and apply this and put your comments below
thanks for so much for watching

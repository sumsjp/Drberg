let's talk about the number one most addictive food in the world and it is pizza yeah that's
right you have this baked doughy crispy crust with this incredible cheese and you add some parmesan
in there and the salty tomato sauce with maybe some sausage or pepperoni with all the different
spices so you have these uh complex flavors you have the savory you have the salty you have the
sweet but mostly pizza is a refined carbohydrate and it's definitely going to spike your dopamine
it's going to stimulate your reward centers it's going to give you pleasure
especially if you're consuming pizza from italy which has the best pizza in the world
not that i know anything about that but pizza hands down is the most addictive food on the
planet and then you have chocolate then you have chips then cookies then ice cream french fries and
cheeseburgers now for talking about addictions i want to know your addictions comment down below
the food that you're mostly addicted to of course you're probably on keto but before keto what was
the thing you were mostly addicted to i'm curious but on the flip side let's talk about the least
addictive foods the number one being cucumbers in fact i don't think i've ever met anyone that
was addicted to cucumbers but i think it would be a good addiction to have it'd be pretty healthy
cucumbers are pretty non-toxic and they pretty much will never be a problem if you consume them
in large amounts then we have carrots broccoli and water these are the least addictive foods now if
you're not a keto i want you to know something first of all i put a link down below of exactly
what to do if you want to start keto but here's what you need to know you can actually make a
delicious pizza keto friendly and i put the link down below i show you how to do it it's quite good
it's not identical but it's a good substitute there's also a lot of different keto friendly
chocolate recipes there are keto friendly chips there are definitely a lot of keto cookies out
there keto ice cream recipes and there's also keto friendly french fry recipes that you can make
too but since we're on the topic of addictions dopamine is the key neurotransmitter that you
want to boost and there's been some interesting data on discovering some confidential documents
in a library related to the sugar lobbyist group and the sugar industry and dental caries and
here's a few things that were said in 1950 the aim was to find other methods of controlling
tooth decay other than restricting carbohydrates because back then they knew that carbs were a
major cause of a lot of problems they even tried to find a vaccine that could inhibit tooth decay
and there was another document that in 1943 the president of the sugar research foundation
wrote a letter to the tobacco companies because apparently he was trying to work for them too and
in this confidential letter this is what he said the foundation which she's talking about the sugar
research foundation was formed to investigate charges that refined sugar was the primary cause
of tooth decay b vitamin deficiency and diabetes so in other words they formed this foundation
to counter these charges that refined sugar created all these problems he went on to say
that he organized and directed research projects in medical schools hospitals universities and
colleges which then went on to exonerate sugar as being the cause of most of these diseases so right
around that time they also got people to focus on this low-fat concept of being the cause of
heart disease so really the tactics of the tobacco industry came from the sugar industry if you are
addicted to anything what you want to do is you want to start increasing your dopamine from other
things other than what you're addicted to and the three top things that i'm going to recommend
are number one exercise okay exercise will increase your dopamine and again dopamine is
the pleasure hormone so the more exercise the more dopamine that you're going to have number
two vitamin d okay vitamin d is great for any type of depression it's good for raising your mood and
it's definitely good to increase your dopamine i would recommend 20 000 ius per day and the last
thing that will increase your dopamine is doing fasting both intermittent fasting on a regular
basis as well as periodic prolonged fasting this is why fasting is very beneficial to increase your
overall mood thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

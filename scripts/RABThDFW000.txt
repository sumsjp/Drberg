Hey, guys.
In this video we're going to talk about this amazing trace mineral called chromium.
First of all, a trace mineral is a mineral needed in very small amounts, usually below
100 milligrams, but, the unique factor of this mineral is it enhances the function of
insulin, so it allows insulin to work better.
What condition do you think that would be good for?
You guessed it, insulin resistance, because what happens when the cells start resisting
insulin, the feedback loops that go to the pancreas then tell the pancreas to make more
insulin because it's not getting through.
People with insulin resistance have about five to seven times more insulin than a normal
person.
Chromium allows this insulin to penetrate the cell better, improving insulin resistance.
Now, there's two other minerals that can ... Or two other elements that can do that.
One is potassium, and B1.
Now we got chromium, that would be a really good combination to help someone with a blood
sugar issue.
It's actually called the glucose tolerance factor because it improves the tolerance of
glucose.
Some people have a glucose sensitivity, well, chromium helps that.
Basically chromium helps your blood sugars.
Broccoli has the most chromium of any vegetable, so you should start consuming your broccoli.
Brewer's yeast is another good one, eggs, grass-fed beef, green beans, turkey is very
high in chromium.
There's a lot of other foods that have chromium as well, or you can get it as a supplement.
I just wanted to put that out there and definitely if you have a blood sugar issue, start taking
chromium.
Thanks for watching.

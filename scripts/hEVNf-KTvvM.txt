hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the Apple now
I totally used to recommend eating apples snacking on apples to help you
lose weight I thought they were a great snack until recently I actually looked
up the nutritional profile of an apple I was shocked to find out yes
very low fats low cholesterol zero cholesterol massive amounts of
carbohydrate but most of that is sugar so 19 grams of sugar but this Apple is
huge so it's double what a normal apple should be so we're talking about forty
close to 40 grams of sugar in one Apple this is enough sugar to completely stop
fat burning for at least one to two days yeah so until you are at your ideal
weight I don't recommend anymore consuming any apples or for that matter
any fruit so the question is what should you snack on you should snack on
anything because every time you eat anything especially sugar you're spiking
insulin and the presence of insulin you can't burn fat so we have to keep the
insulin very very low so three meals a day nothing in between if you can't go
from one meal to the next without snacking all we know is we need to
increase more fat now I know you're saying it's not going to cause problems
with my calories you need to watch my video on the fats and how that
interplays with your body because the fat won't turn fat allows you to go from
one meal to the next and keeps the insulin down and insulin is the culprit
in fact fat is very low on the scale of insulin as far as influencing it at all
it's kind of like a neutral food so not only avoid apples do three meals a day
no snacking if you want some snack or nuts or cheese or anything like that
have that with the meal not between the meal all right I'll see you in the next
video

hey guys in this video we're going to show you how to fix hair loss how to
make your nails really really strong and less brittle how to make your collagen
youthful looking so when you have problems with the hair nails and skin
that is the protein deficiency but it cannot be fixed by consuming more
protein so if people start downing more chicken and fish and they're wondering
why it doesn't fix this because there's another nutrient involved that's missing
and that is trace minerals now what are trace minerals
they're basically minerals required in smaller amounts less than 100 milligrams
like for example you might think of minerals as calcium magnesium potassium
but then there's other minerals like selenium manganese zinc that are
needed in very very small amounts okay now the problem with you going out and
eating dirt to get your minerals right is that your body doesn't absorb rocks
too well so we absorb plant base minerals because plant based minerals
are fifteen thousand times smaller than salt or rock minerals the plant is
supposed to take the rock break it down absorb it into plant and make it easy
for us to assimilate so ideally we want to get our nutrients from our plants
especially the mineral family now in America we're missing the trace minerals
and that's why you see young kids coming out with bad teeth bad dental structure
their mandible their facial structures are off but in Africa where the soils
are rich they got perfect teeth that barely brush your teeth I mean they have
great bone structure so that's why so we need these trace minerals trace minerals
act as cofactors and what is a cofactor it's like a helper helper nutrient and
in 600 biochemical reactions with enzymes so what does that mean it means
that the enzymes are the things that help you build things up in your body
it's like the work force and they need they're built with trace minerals so
each enzyme has its own trace mineral or mineral where it works from or it uses
to make it work and especially in the production of protein synthesis or the
reduction of protein making we need the trace minerals one of the products I use
is plant-based trace minerals this is a 70 million years old
where that when the soils were really rich and there's a company that I use
that liquefied these minerals and so it's 15,000 times smaller so they're
very easy to absorb and you take one dropper full a day and you don't need a
lot you just need a little bit to kick in these enzymes to make the hair the
nails the skin to grow back now the other thing you need to do in addition
to this is consume more vegetable you're going to need about seven to ten cups of
salad per day not iceberg but nutrient-dense to be able to fortify and
give you more minerals in your diet this is kind of like a enhancement for the
trace mineral part not just the regular minerals okay in summary if you have
these problems with your nail skin collagen problems don't eat more protein
look at the underlying cause add some more trace minerals eat more vegetables
and that will give your body the foundation it needs to build healthy
proteins

let's talk about the hidden cause of prostate enlargement that is this right here too much
estrogen in the body now typically men have low amounts of estrogen except for two
exceptions one is in utero which it means before you were born and number two
when you get older now the vast majority of estrogen that you have actually comes from
your testosterone your testosterone converts into estrogen with this enzyme right here
aromatase your testes do produce some estrogen 20 but 80 of the rest of your estrogen
comes from the periphery additional organs and tissues the brain tissue the skin bone and your
fat cells and because estrogen is an anabolic hormone it makes things grow there's receptors in
the prostate that interact with this and this will stimulate the growth and even increase your risk
of prostate cancer so what is the solution to this problem number one help normalize estrogen by
losing weight that would be number one but there are also aromatase inhibitors that you can take
that are natural one would be maca root now believe it or not maca root is in the cruciferous
family of vegetables it's a root you also have stinging nettle root which is a very good herb
that also is a good anti-inflammatory as well and then you have all the cruciferous vegetables
which are anti-estrogen because they inhibit this enzyme right here so what you want to
do is you want to do a healthy version of keto with intermittent fasting for those of you who
are new i'd put the link down below but also make sure that you include either maca root
or stinging nettle root or even yet start consuming a lot more cruciferous vegetables in your diet
and i think that could greatly help you with this situation before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

today we're going to talk about a very common
yet under diagnosed condition autonomic neuropathy
now what does autonomic neuropathy mean neuropathy means nerve damage and with
autonomic we're dealing with the part of the nervous system
that's called the autonomic nervous system which controls things
automatically which is a combination of the flight or fight stress response
and the parasympathetic nervous system which is rest or digest
and the enteric system which is another system that can control your digestive
system that part of the nervous system is on
automatic and you don't have to do anything it just
works on its own as in bladder control cardiovascular system control i mean you
don't have to think about your heartbeat it just automatically
works digestion and genitals you may have heard a condition called
peripheral neuropathy where you have damage to the peripheral nerves on the
bottom of your feet or your hands those are the sensory nerves that get
damaged from conditions like diabetes for example where your hands or feet get
numb like a burning sensation or even severe
pain and here's the thing the number one
cause of this condition is diabetes but if you think about it
you don't just end up with diabetes overnight it gradually goes from high
insulin to insulin resistance to pre-diabetes to
eventually a diabetic right well you don't end up with this
condition overnight either it gradually occurs so you may have
one or more of these symptoms and that could be the beginning of this condition
i'm increasing your awareness so you can do something about it before you end up
with this condition just because you weren't diagnosed with diabetes
doesn't mean that it's not related to a blood sugar issue
another cause of this could be some type of autoimmune condition to
part of the nervous system or maybe even a virus but diabetes is number one
on the list so let's go through the symptoms urinary retention
a lot of people have this symptom but they never connect the dots with
it being connected to maybe a pre-diabetic state or even
a blood sugar problem number two hypertension
we know diabetics usually have high blood pressure at some point
well now we know why then you have number three
abdominal pain or achiness and that can show up in kind of an
uncomfortable feeling in your abdominal area number four
malabsorption this is a real big one you may not feel this but it might show up
in nutritional deficiencies which is a whole other series of
symptoms number five gastroparesis this is simply a condition
where your digestive system is very sluggish
it's slow and things just move at a snail's pace
well guess what that's what's causing it coming
usually from this or a pre-diabetic state number six
constipation a very common symptom number seven sleep apnea number eight
abnormal sweating that could be either your body is too dry
or you sweat too often so many people have an abnormal
sweating situation either they don't sweat enough or they sweat
too much number nine orthostatic hypotension
this occurs when you stand up and you get really dizzy your blood pressure
drops too low another name for this would be pots
all right number 10 arrhythmias so that would
involve the cardio as far as having autonomic neuropathy
of the genitals that can range from pain to just lack of function of those organs
what can be done about this condition there's two things
that i would recommend benfotamine which is a
fat-soluble b vitamin which works really good on peripheral neuropathy but it
also is effective in all types of neuropathy
especially if it's related to diabetes or pre-diabetes
and alpha lipoic acid both of these act as a very powerful antioxidant to
repair not only the free radical damage that's coming from this
but both of these are fat soluble and they support
the myelin sheath around the nerve which is the protecting part
the effectiveness of this in this i believe is dependent on if you're also
doing keto intermittent fasting because this gets at the the root of this
problem right here but these two right here would be two
really good recommendations for this condition all right thanks for

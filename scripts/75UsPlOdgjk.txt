let's talk about the 10 benefits of fiber now when i'm talking about fiber i'm talking about
vegetable fiber i'm not talking about grain fibers like bran or anything like that but vegetables
and i do recommend as part of a healthy keto lifestyle you consume a good amount of vegetables
whether that's salad or other vegetables now also on the flip side there's certain times
where i don't recommend vegetables if you have sibo or you have a history of a lot of digestive
damage that might make things worse so you're going to have to test it out but here are some
benefits of fiber in general number one fiber has a zero effect on insulin despite being a
carbohydrate number two it generally contains a lot of phytonutrients like carotenoids for example
and it also contains vitamins and minerals number three fiber can bind to bile and help regulate
the amount of bile in the body i did a separate video on that i'm going to put a link down below
number four it can help feed your microflora in fact the good bacteria in your large intestine
eat fiber as their main source of food and our bodies don't have the ability to digest fiber
thank goodness we have bacteria that can help us out and that fiber that is fed to the microbes
then gives the microbes energy and the byproducts that the microbes make when they ferment this
fiber is called small chain fatty acids which not only feed the colon cells but they also help
your blood sugars they'll help insulin resistance and they're even anti-cancer all right number six
it helps regulate your ph when you feed these microbes especially the lactobacillus the ph can
now be in the range that you need it to prevent pathogens from existing in that environment
number seven fiber helps to transient time as far as how fast things go through the digestive system
number eight fiber can help regulate lipids in cholesterol
not that lipids or cholesterol is bad but they help regulate it to some degree and number nine
certain fibers have an anti-cancer effect probably because they're loaded with phytonutrients
and they're converted to small chain fatty acids number 10 fiber helps buffer
the blood sugar response so when you eat certain carbohydrates whether it's a carrot or a celery or
a tomato the amount of fiber in that food greatly helps to minimize the glycemic response from that
carbohydrate all right there you have it the 10 benefits of fiber before you go if you have
a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing

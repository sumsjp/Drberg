now if you're running into a situation where your ketones just are not high enough you're doing
keto and you're just seeing traces of ketones there's several reasons for this number one
it could be you just started and it takes time to adapt the mitochondria to full
ketosis so you're not going to see very many changes until starting at three days
and then over a week but to be fully fat adapted where you're in full ketosis all the time
it's going to take about a month okay so just give it more time if you just start it and
you're concerned next point is are you checking your urine or are you checking your blood in the
beginning i suggest you check your urine these are very inexpensive little strips that you can test
but realize as you become more adapted you're going to be burning up these ketones so in other
words less ketones are going to be wasted through the urine so they're not going to really show up
at some point so don't be surprised if you check your urine ketones and they're very very trace
and then of course if you check your blood it's a lot higher next point is your protein is too high
protein can trigger insulin which can then slow down the ability to get into
ketosis so i'm assuming your carbs are low but let's say your protein is too
high a lot of times people think that a ketogenic diet is a high protein diet because they've
they're used to atkins well no it's not a good ketogenic plan it's a moderate amount of protein
between three to six ounces per meal but it could go up to seven ounces or eight ounces especially
if you're doing intermittent fasting and you're an athlete and you're just a larger person
so just realize that the more protein you do and the less fat you're going to run into a situation
where you're not going to be as much into ketosis now there's a really great document i just created
a new plan which i updated which has a chart in it which you can download i put the link down below
that has all the proteins with the protein to fat ratios so you can see
the foods that you need to be focusing on heavier in the fat and less lean so some examples of
moderate protein higher fat would be sausage fatty fish pecans macadamia nuts cod liver certain stews
and sardines some other foods that would be very very helpful to start getting your fat
level higher to offset this protein would be olive oil olives fatty cheese butter things like that so
make sure you cook with tail or beef fats or other saturated fats definitely not the unsaturated fats
unless it's olive oil next point is stress stress acts like sugar it activates cortisol
it can definitely keep your ketone levels at a minimum and then lack of sleep i've done a lot
of videos on this if you're not sleeping you're going to throw off your blood sugars it's going to
limit your ability to get into ketosis all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next

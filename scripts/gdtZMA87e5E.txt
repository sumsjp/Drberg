so let's talk about what is better butter or
coconut oil now as far as cooking goes they're both really good for cooking
okay so i use both of them let's look at the
fat soluble vitamins butter has a good amount of vitamin a
e d and especially k2 if it's from grass-fed cows so you'd
always want to consume butter from grass-fed cows kerrygold is a
really good type of butter but there's many others
now vitamin a is vital for the immune system it's good for the vision
it is the key vitamin for your eye vitamin e is essential for your heart
for the the pituitary gland it's this is very important in menopause
and this is also really good to keep your muscles strong
if at any point that you feel like your muscles are weak especially when you're
exercising you take vitamin e you'll feel a difference pretty quick in
strength and endurance and then of course vitamin d that's an
anti-inflammatory it's essential for your immune system
it's good for lowering blood pressure and the list
goes on and on and on and then k2 drives calcium out of the wrong
places it will kind of remove calcium from the soft tissues of the arteries
and the joints it also is involved in the strength of the mitochondria and it
can actually give you endurance when you exercise now let's
talk about mct oil this is medium chain triglycerides
this turns right into ketones it gives you energy
okay so butter only has eight percent but coconut oil
has 55 so coconut oil is the winner on that level
and mct oil is really good for cognitive function quick energy and
especially if you're just starting out with keto and you want
ketones really fast the mct fats will fill up in your blood and your brain
will prefer that over glucose coconut oil also has
something called lauric acid okay so that's really good for your
immune system it doesn't have a lot but it has some so
that's another positive benefit now butter has small chain fatty acid
butyrate okay this is really good for your blood sugars
it's food for your colon cells it's also anti-cancer and as a side note
your microbiome your friendly bacteria takes fiber
from your vegetables and it converts it into butyrate
so in a cow they eat the grass goes into their digestive system
and the microbes then turn it into butyrate so it ends up
in the fat in the milk thus the small chain fatty acid
now there's a very very small amount of casein that's the protein
in butter not not too much it's almost insignificant so if there is an
allergy that you have i don't think you'll have a reaction
but i just want to let you know it's in there so maybe you want to do what's
called clarified butter or ghee to have this removed
the question is which one is healthier well i'm going to go more for the butter
right here but when you're using it for cooking
realize it's going to destroy all these right here okay especially if there's
high heat so if you're cooking you could use
either one but if you're putting it on your food
this one is healthier all right thanks for watching

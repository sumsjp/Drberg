do you realize that there are animals that are resistant to certain diseases that actually kill
humans it's true and i'm going to talk about four of them it's just an interesting topic let's start
with the elephant okay elephants don't get cancer they're protected from cancer yet they have over
a hundred times more cells than humans but why don't they get cancer well they isolated that
they have 20 copies of a very specific gene called tp53 which is a tumor suppressor gene
you have these genes in your body that suppress tumors okay well they have 20 and humans only have
one and that gene is called the guardian of the genome quite fascinating then you have the naked
mole rat okay which is also protected from cancer and they have extreme high levels of something
called hyaluronin which is a compound that can cage the cancer and keep it from spreading
quite interesting they're also protected from hypoxia lack of oxygen probably because they
live most of the life underground and there might not be a lot of oxygen down there they're
also protected against oxidative stress they have this highly expressed gene called nrf
gene which is also called the master of oxidative stress protection now this gene
which i'm going to do a video on this is quite fascinating because we also have this gene
has the ability to protect against diseases in extreme environments related to oxidation
and it actually controls your antioxidant levels that give you protection against oxidation it also
stimulates a very high level of autophagy which can then remove stress damage proteins so the
naked mole rat very interesting animal you might want to consider getting a pet instead of your
gerbil or hamster because they live 30 years then you have bears did you realize that a bear becomes
diabetic when it hibernates and then when it awakens that diabetes goes away so what happens
is when they go into hibernation their insulin just shuts right down why so they can tap into
their fat reserves because higher levels of insulin block the ability to tap into fat
and also during the summer months when they're eating a lot getting fat which they increase
their fat over 50 percent they don't even get insulin resistance at all it's only when they
start to hibernate that the body starts shutting down insulin very interesting
then you have the chimpanzee and they're protected against pathogens by using certain leaves okay so
instead of chewing them they actually roll these leaves around the mouth and it kills the bacteria
fungus parasites and so it acts as a very powerful antibiotic i'm just curious how they found out
that that leaf does that i mean i have no idea but it's quite interesting so anyway that's
all i have in this video thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

if you want something really good to support liver detoxification
definitely don't forget the beet okay beets have a lot of amazing properties but one is the ability
to bind and hook up these toxins and poisons and actually convert them into water soluble particles
okay and they do this with a very unique chemical called betalain so betalain uses glutathione to
transform poisons into non-poisons so that is part of something called phase two enzymes okay
and so phase three is that complete elimination of that poison so you have all these chain
reactions that occur through the liver and they get triggered through various chemicals one being
present in beets and beets have some other really unique properties one is the support of your eye
okay it has lutein and zeaxanthin okay both of those natural chemicals help protect the eye
from damage to the retina damage from cataracts damage from macular degeneration beets are also
loaded with natural nitrates that help to support your blood pressure and the arteries
beets also have something called betaine which is made from choline so both betaine and choline
help reduce fat from accumulating on your liver now beets are also loaded with folate
now folate is does a lot of things but one of the big things that it will do is it prevents
dna damage so thereby lessening the chance of mutations from occurring and decreasing
the risk of cancer and so this is why certain properties in beets are really good to help shrink
tumors in the colon and the stomach in the nervous system in your lungs
in the breast tissue in the prostate tissue as well as in the testicle beets are loaded with
vitamin c a very powerful antioxidant it's loaded with manganese which also acts as an antioxidant
and copper so not only do beets have very powerful vitamins and minerals but they also have very
special and unique phytonutrients that help you detoxify the body as well as reduce inflammation
now if you're going to consume beets i would highly recommend that you steam them
for no longer than 15 minutes put them on your salad and one common question is are beets okay
on a ketogenic diet well beets tend to be higher on the glycemic index but they're also very low in
the glycemic load which means they're very high in fiber and so they're not going to spike your
blood sugars unless you juice them that's why i recommend you consume them whole and so you can
steam them you can cook them but don't overcook them or even consume them pickled all right thanks

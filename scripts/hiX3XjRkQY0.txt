if you're struggling with hair loss or
your hair is thinning out or you're
getting patches of your hair falling out
i created a very short video to explain
why check it out
you know there's a lot of similarities
between
your hair
and the garden in your back yard both of
them have a root structure and are
completely dependent
on the condition where that root grows
now you can't grow a vegetable garden
on dirt okay you need super fertile soil
now you can spray a little fertilizer on
there and maybe grow something but it's
not going to taste good it's not going
to be nutrient dense and one of the
biggest problems with people that are
losing their hair is they kind of do the
same thing they spray a little
fertilizer on their hair and
in hopes that their hair is going to
grow back they might use a little
rogaine medication or shampoos or oils
trying to fix this thing from the
outside in instead of the inside out in
order to grow healthy hair you need a
fertile scalp
just like your garden in the backyard
you need minerals you need water you
need oxygen
in your scalp in order for that hair to
grow very specifically you need zinc
you need copper and the right ratios you
need selenium you need calcium and you
definitely need oxygen
so if you wanted a different approach
working from the inside out instead of
the outside in
and to develop a healthy scalp so the
hair has the fertility it needs to grow

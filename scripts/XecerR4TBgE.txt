some people develop gallbladder symptoms when they're doing a prolonged fast okay i'm talking
about like gastritis would be a symptom pain or tightness in the right shoulder area or pain or
tightness underneath the right ribcage or even burping or belching all these symptoms could
be a problem with your bile and gallstones or gallbladder sludge which is a situation where your
bile is too thick develop as the concentration of cholesterol goes up and the concentration of bile
goes down now i have two diagrams i want you to look at on the diagram on the left you have this
little gallbladder with low cholesterol and higher amounts of bile okay so the green is the bile
and the white is the cholesterol okay that is normal the diagram of the gallbladder on the right
has a high concentration of cholesterol and a low concentration of bile that is abnormal
because the formation of a gallstone occurs when you get this higher concentration of cholesterol
so we have this high concentration of cholesterol low concentration of bile that develops bio sludge
which is just a thick bile concentration because there's too much cholesterol in it and then
eventually that can lead to a gallstone now what does this have to do with going on a ketogenic
diet or doing fasting well when you are in fat burning the fat is going to release triglycerides
and cholesterol so when you're fasting especially when you're doing prolonged fasting and you're not
eating any fats that cholesterol is coming from your own fat now normally the maximum saturation
of cholesterol happens at 15 hours of fasting but as soon as you eat or get to 20 hours of fasting
the concentration comes down normally unless you have a pre-existing liver problem or pre-existing
gallbladder problem or you're deficient in bile for some reason or you're lacking intestinal flora
because you had an antibiotic at some point and then intestinal flora the friendly microbes can't
make enough bile so you're going to be deficient so when there's liver problems whether you have a
fatty liver or you have an inflamed liver or you have cirrhosis or scar tissue you're not going to
make enough bile and if your intestines don't have the friendly microbes that could be another reason
why you're not going to make enough bile and because you don't have enough bile and you do a
prolonged fast you may end up with these symptoms because the concentration of cholesterol is going
up and the concentration of bile is going down now what is the solution to this well over time
your liver is going to get better your gallbladder is going to get better your microbes and your gut
are going to be more diversified there are so many benefits of prolonged fasting so i don't want you
to stop this i want you to continue it the simple solution is to add some purified bile salts
while you're fasting on an empty stomach i would recommend taking two in the morning
and two in the afternoon and that way that extra bile will help you to break down this
cholesterol and get the ratio of more bile salts to cholesterol and so this extra bile can get rid
of this cholesterol that's coming from your fat cells all right so that is the simple solution
to gallbladder symptoms when you're fasting hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

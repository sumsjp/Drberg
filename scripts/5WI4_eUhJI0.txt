did you realize that nuts are actually not a healthy snack now before you click off
just hear me out one ounce of nuts is roughly about 14.2 grams of fat six grams of protein
6.1 grams of carbs but 3.6 grams of fiber giving you a 2.5 grams net carbs so it's low carb
high fat moderate protein sounds pretty good to me doesn't it but here's the problem right here
this word snack we never want to consume snacks snacking is very bad why because it triggers
this right here in your small intestine called GIP gastric inhibitory polypeptide
now what is that that is a hormone-like compound that has a main role of stimulating insulin
the data that you really need to understand is every time you eat you're stimulating insulin
regardless of whatever you eat and this is why intermittent fasting is so vitally important not
just for your weight but for your overall health this GIP hormone also stimulates fat accumulation
and appetite this is why when you have a snack between the meals you're hungry an hour and a
half later so it's totally fine to consume nuts just consume them with a meal or right
after the meal not as a snack late at night or in between meals and you'll feel so much better
another interesting piece of data diabetics are not responsive to gip this compound right here
what does that mean it means that they're resistant to insulin and they don't have
the benefit of insulin pushing down their blood sugars and that's why they're diabetic because
the blood sugar goes higher in other words this is not a good thing right here and a diabetic
should definitely be doing intermittent fasting uh to help reverse diabetes now if you're new to

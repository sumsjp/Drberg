so my question today is are you getting enough sulfur in your diet and what is sulfur and what
is it good for and how would this apply to your health well sulfur is uh really really important
in several aspects number one it's needed to make two very important amino acids okay one's called
methionine and the other one is called cysteine now methionine is an essential amino acid which
means you must get it from your diet your body cannot make it yet cystine can be made from your
body but you need sulfur to make both of these amino acids and sulfur is also very important in
making the antioxidant glutathione which has a very important function in detoxification
especially in your liver for many different things in fact if you're deficient in glutathione you're
going to build up too much hydrogen peroxide and that can actually lead to a whole bunch of things
one being your hair becomes prematurely gray and you're just kind of a hard time clearing
toxins from the body sulfur is very necessary in making keratin which is
essential for your hair nails and skin it gives the structure of your skin
so if you're not getting enough keratin because you don't have enough sulfur your skin's going to
become loose sulfur is necessary in making insulin and if you've been watching any of my videos you
know how important that is number three it's involved in collagen synthesis so without sulfur
you can't make collagen which makes up your joints and if you're deficient in that you're
going to have all sorts of problems with joints joints falling apart and this is why a lot of
the supplements for joints involve sulfur also methionine has been known to decrease
kidney stones in dogs so if your dog has kidney stones start giving it methionine finite is
important in keeping your histamines low to prevent allergies so some people take methionine
to help with allergies and even asthma and number seven it's intimately involved in phase one phase
two detoxification so if there's a poison that comes in your body like something that can cause
cancer sulfur-based methionine is needed to help clear out these poisons and so if you're low on
sulfur or methionine you're going to build up a lot more toxins in your body and you could even be
more susceptible to getting cancer because these chemicals can't be cleared from the body sulfur is
also needed to make vitamin b1 thymine as well as biotin rats fed without the amino acid methionine
develop fatty livers and so where do we get softer well it's in fish it's in seafood it's in beef
it's in eggs it's in cheese it's in garlic onions brussels sprouts in cabbage but the form of sulfur
in plants is different than in animal products it's in an inorganic form which means that most
of the sulfur based compounds in your body are going to come more from the animal based products
versus the inorganic form so in other words if you're relying on your sulfur just from plants
you may be deficient now what situations could occur if you might be deficient in sulfur number
one if you're taking a lot of acetaminophen which is going to deplete your sulfur
because you need more sulfur to get rid of this chemical so anything of a toxic nature or
anything involving medications or drugs or anything you're going to need more sulfur to get
rid of it also you're gonna need more sulfur if you have an infection if you're exposed to toxins
and if you're consuming proteins with either no or low methionine like in fruit
most vegetables excluding garlic onions brussels sprouts and cabbage and legumes and so if your
diet is primarily fruits vegetables and legumes you're going to have an incomplete protein you're
going to have to substitute your diet with more methionine also if you're estrogen dominant or
you have a lot of estrogen to your body let's say you're taking birth control pills or
hormone replacement therapy you're going to need more sulfur to detoxify estrogen as well so
in summary make sure you're consuming enough fish seafood beef eggs cheese and definitely
garlic onions brussels sprouts and cabbage hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

i'm going to talk about the benefits of something called tudca okay what does it stand for well it's
a very very long name for a very specific bile acid and this type of bile acid has been found
to be present in bearers now they used to kill a lot of bears just for this bile
because it was so valuable um but now they made it synthetically which seems
to work pretty good and um they don't have to kill the bears anymore which is a good thing
but this treatment using this very specific bile acid has been used for hundreds of years in asia
it's been used by the american indians for various purposes it's used for treating gallstones
because a gallstone is a lack of bile and it's a super concentrated cholesterol stone that can be
dissolved when you add more bile also this type of bile acid is used for liver cirrhosis because it
inhibits fibrosis which is scarring of the liver so anyway it's a really great ingredient for
a lot of different things especially if you tried everything and nothing's worked
try this because it's very very effective at a lot of different conditions
let's just talk about what it can do it can help you thin your bile many people have a situation
where their bile is too thick and they might not develop a stone but they have a lot of pain
in the right lower quadrant of their abdomen so they have a lot of congestion bloating and that
can create pancreatitis it can create a whole bunch of issues because the bile then backs up
into the liver and it's a detergent so it's very very irritating to the liver tissue and that can
cause pain and shoot up to your right shoulder blade and up to the neck and create headaches
create a whole bunch of problems now also realize that where the liver is located on the right side
when it gets backed up it can put pressure on the heart it can put pressure on your
lungs so it can affect breathing it can affect the heart it can create
palpitations and even arrhythmias by having the liver being a little bit too swollen
and because there's just not enough space in that area so there's a lot of benefits to the heart
by taking this tudca now some of you are gonna ask me um what type of brand should i buy whatever
well i'm not gonna recommend a certain brand that's up to you to do that research because i
can't get involved with um trying to figure out what the quality is and regulate them because
if i recommend a certain product and then they change the formula so you just have to do your
own research on that but i recommend the dosage to start out if you have a major problem take two
on an empty stomach in the morning and take two in the afternoon and empty stomach but
if you take it with food it's going to help you digest the food all right number two there's been
a lot of research in the past in ongoing research on the eyes on retinal degenerative disease
on various problems with the eye on improving visual acuity why because bile helps you break
down and absorb vitamin a and there's a lot of other reasons why it helps the eye as well
number three it's been shown to improve symptoms of parkinson's disease why because
it's neuroprotective it seems to help the neurons in your brain it also has shown positive effects
on alf that is a certain autoimmune disease okay so if you have als you should be taking
cut cup number five it's shown benefits of not just preventing a stroke but also
repairing the damage of a stroke because it's neural protective in your brain
all right number six it's it's good for spasms number seven it can reduce fevers
number eight it can improve your eyesight which i mentioned previously number nine it prevents
something called apoptosis which is program cell death caused by a stressed mitochondria
so in other words tutka helps to stabilize the mitochondria and it prevents this
program cell death very very powerful number 10 it has very good anti-inflammatory effects especially
of the liver so if you have any liver problem like cirrhosis hepatitis or or a fatty liver this would
be a good thing to take number 11 it can decrease fibrosis which is very cool number 12. it protects
the brain i already mentioned that and it can decrease plaquing of those beta amyloid plaques
in the brain very cool 13 it can support insulin sensitivity so if you have insulin resistance it
can help with that condition it can make insulin more sensitive so for a diabetic it's really good
stuff number 14 it supports the gut lining if you have leaky gut or there's some permeability issues
where there's food that's getting into the pores of your intestine this would be a good thing to
support that condition especially if you have like inflammation of the colon itself and number 15 it
helps protect the kidney so as you can see it does a lot of things and i just scratched the surface
so anyway i just wanted to bring your awareness up of this great tool in helping various conditions
i've mentioned it in other videos but i just wanted to create a separate video just on this

hey guys dr. Berg here in this series of three videos we're going to talk about
postponing early death what to do to increase your longevity okay what is the
common thread that is killing people if you look at the top 10 killers you know
heart attack and stroke well we're going to discuss that and what you can do to
avoid that all right so this first thing we're going to talk about in part 1 is
the this one thing which I'm going to reveal in a second you probably already
know what it is will literally cause plaquing which is sticky protein in your
brain which leads to Alzheimer's or dimension this is one of the top killers
okay destroys the brain because it decreases
oxygen and the second one is strokes micro hemorrhaging so what happens is
during a stroke you have bleeding in the brain either from an aneurysm or a clot
okay two different mechanisms same cause stroke is a symptom of this one thing
Alzheimer's is a symptom of this one thing which we'll get to high
cholesterol okay high cholesterol can possibly plug up your arteries right and
cause heart attack right so we have heart attack over here which is caused
by this one thing and then diabetes is caused by it as well so fatty liver high
blood pressure which can then cause stroke so they're all interrelated but
this thing is high insulin this is the common thread which is basically one two
three four from four of the top 10 things that kill people insulin is the
cause these are symptoms what we've done is we've made these the disease like
they're like an entity of itself and they're not looking deeper but this is
the direct relationship cause and effect okay so in the next part of this video
we're going to show you how to fix this okay so you can limit and avoid these
sound good okay so let me show you okay so here's how to lower insulin okay
number one you're going to have to avoid the sugar so you have to get the sugar
completely out of the diet bring it down to zero you're going to also have to get
rid of the starches and the hidden sugars the wine the alcohol
unfortunately and also any type of like even yogurt has hidden sugars in it okay
so we're going to have to just get that out but the cool thing is we're not
going to then just leave you hanging we're going to substitute it with more
fattier foods so that's going to satisfy so you're not going to be hungry you're
going to be satisfied there's a lot of recipes I I want you to click the link
below for some other videos on some ideas okay
so we want to avoid snacking okay why because every time you eat you spike
insulin so we just want three meals a day maybe even two meals a day some of
you are already doing this some of you are not but these are some real simple
things that anyone can do now what's going to get you to go longer without
snacking is adding the fat to the meal you can do peanut butter you can do
almond butter you know to do peanuts you can do almond butter you can do nuts you
can do avocados you can do butter you can do coconut oil
avocado any of those things right exercise exercise will burn up the
excess sugar in your body and that's very very good for blood Sugar's okay
and then when you're not eating between the meals intermittent fasting your body
is forced to use up the stored sugar too so we can always burn up this excess
sugar that's stuck there you know and then we need to increase your vegetables
because we want to spike the potassium potassium is necessary to help you
stabilize blood sugars it's also good for the muscle the energy of the body
because all the cells use it in a lot of it so we're going to have to increase
the quantity of this to also help reduce insulin in fact there's a direct
relationship between if you increase your potassium your insulin comes down
so it's it almost helps to bring that insulin down okay so these are things
that you should do just to increase your longevity all right so in part two the next
video we're going to talk about the next factor that creates a lot of problems

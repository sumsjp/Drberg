i know it's hard to believe some people
don't like vegetables some people don't
get enough vegetables and they want to
find ways to
enhance their diet and there's one
smoothie that i'm going to recommend
okay
this
vegetable substitute is a green product
for sure
but it's not plant-based okay
so let's see if you can guess what it is
okay
nasa did major research on this green
and they said this the nutritional value
of thousand kilograms of fruits and
vegetables equals one kilogram of
fill in the blank can you guess
this green actually has vitamin b12 in
fact it has all the b vitamins it's a
really good iron source it's loaded with
vitamin e
and a pre vitamin a beta carotene
55 to 70
protein okay and 18
essential fatty acid
and this is what it is
spirulina now what is spirulina well
it's a
blue green
algae it's a bacteria that can convert
sunlight to chemical energy
it is 10 times more efficient
in producing photosynthesis
than plants and photosynthesis is the
conversion of sun energy to chemical
energy so it is definitely right up
there as a super food
they also use it to help with radiation
sickness people take it to increase
energy and spirulina is one of the first
organisms to actually make oxygen now if
you're going to get spirulina make sure
it doesn't have added maltodextrin and
there's no added soy now of course i am
not biased of my own spirulina product
but i will put a link down below for you
to check it out but out of all the green
things you can take that are not
vegetable spirulina is a really good
alternative all you do is you add one
scoop with a half a cup of berries i
recommend blueberries and 16 ounces of
water blend it up and drink it down now
this spirulina drink is an enhancement
to your diet i still do recommend that
you get enough leafy greens like salads
as a normal part of your diet and if you
haven't seen my video on the quantity of
salad that i recommend you eat i put
that up right here check it out
you

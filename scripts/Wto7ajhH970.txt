let's talk about the seven ways that you can boost your testosterone these are natural things you can
do the first thing is to make sure you do not lower your cholesterol you want to increase
your cholesterol do not go on a low fat diet why because cholesterol is the precursor the building
blocks that help make testosterone and that's one of the problems too when your doc puts you
on statins statins block cholesterol which then end up lowering testosterone and that is one big
challenge so i'm not telling you not to take your statin all i'm saying is that you might
want to research it get with your doctor and find out the real reason why your cholesterol might be
high and i have some videos on that instead of just treating the symptom let's find out what
the actual cause is but you don't want to go low on the cholesterol if you want high testosterone
let's talk about protein moderate protein a myth is that you need a lot of protein to stimulate
your testosterone no you need a moderate amount now what's a moderate amount well i'd say about
between six to eight ounces per meal now i'm talking about the weight of the actual food
like a piece of steak or a hamburger or something like that i'm not talking about the grams within
that because the grams within that is a lot less i do have quite a few videos on protein i'll put
some down below if you want more information on that but you just want to avoid too much protein
if you consume too much protein you're going to get tired and the reason why
you're going to get tired is that your like half of it can easily be turned into glucose
so when you turn it into glucose because your body doesn't necessarily use amino acids
as its fuel some but not much it has to be converted into glucose to be used as
fuel so that excess amount of insulin that's triggered by the glucose is going to block
your testosterone so just do a moderate amount of protein number three you want to go low carbs for
the same reason because carbs increase insulin so if we keep our insulin low we can enhance
testosterone and other beneficial hormones like growth hormone number four exercise will stimulate
testosterone if it's high intensity and oval training or exercise involving the whole body
to the point where you're sweating but not over training but the problem is if you're not sleeping
you don't want to do that okay because it's going to strain your heart you want to do long
walks for a while to lower the cortisol so you can sleep so you can eventually add more exercise to
then increase more testosterone now just as a side note and i didn't put this on this chart is that i
always recommend when you do low carb it's called keto you also do intermittent fasting intermittent
fasting improves growth hormone and wherever growth hormone goes testosterone goes it tends
to follow similar pathways and so intermittent fasting is vital to keep your testosterone levels
normal because if you're doing snacks and frequent meals you're just going to increase insulin and
suppress testosterone that is why a pre-diabetic or someone with insulin resistance or a diabetic
normally always has low testosterone and that's going to affect your muscle mass and it's going
to affect your libido and your energy number five sleep very very important why because we want to
keep our cortisol lower increase cortisol the stress hormone we lower testosterone we
also want to keep estrogen on the low side so you want to avoid soy products especially soy protein
isolates which is in a lot of diet foods and like the fake meat and things like that and then you
want to avoid things that increase estrogen so you want to do organic because pesticides
insecticides act like estrogen in the body they're called estrogen mimickers or endocrine disruptors
there are certain supplements that can also help you as well the most important one is zinc
about 100 milligrams per day this will actually work very well another good one that i recommend
is the korean red ginseng this not only improves testosterone but it's going to improve your energy
it's going to give you a sense of calmness it'll give you stamina it'll give you vitality it's a
really really good herb it's been used for a very long long time with great success l-arginine will
increase something called nitric oxide which can increase testosterone it's a good supplement
but remember any time you're doing supplements they may not work if your diet isn't corrected
and if you don't know what to eat i put a link down below and then we have something called d
aspartic acid another really good compound to help increase testosterone last few points if
you have a fatty liver and you're looking down you have a gut you have a fatty liver that's going to
inhibit your ability to make testosterone so you want to work on removing the fat from your liver
by doing a moderate protein low-carb ketogenic diet also if your iron is too high that can
suppress your testosterone and it can destroy your liver so i always recommend if you're male not to
take iron supplements and even post-menopausal women who are no longer menstruating should be
careful too because iron in excess is very harmful to your liver and hormones and it's very difficult
for your body to get rid of iron so you want to be careful not to get it in supplements which
you might even not be aware of when you read the label it's like wow i've been taking all this iron
no i wouldn't recommend that and statins i already talked about that point all right there you go

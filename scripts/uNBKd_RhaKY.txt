last week i talked about cold intolerance this week we're going to talk about
heat intolerance what is it what can you do about it well it's a situation where you get overheated
easily in warmer weather you can either have a situation where you're sweating excessively
when you really shouldn't be sweating or you're not sweating at all in hot weather and when
your body is in warmer weather you may feel a little bit weak or dizzy so heat intolerance
is a symptom of various conditions one ms number two something called pots postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome what is that that's a situation where your autonomic nervous system is
not adapting that well so when you're standing up you get really dizzy and lightheaded so you
have to sit down number three dysautonomia this is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system
which this is one condition of this but you can have a lot of other problems related to this right
here but in general the autonomic nervous system helps you adapt to certain things like stress
uh temperature so let's say for example you just get out of the shower and you get dressed
and you break out and sweat that would be one example another example is heat intolerance
failure to adapt to warmer environments and number four hyperthyroid conditions so that can create a
situation where you're intolerant to heat what's interesting is all four of these conditions have a
common thread low vitamin b1 when you increase vitamin b1 you can improve the symptoms of ms
not just heat intolerance but fatigue also you can improve symptoms of pots
dysautonomia and symptoms of hyperthyroidism i would recommend taking a good amount of
this try to find a b complex that's natural nutritional yeast is a really good source but
you're gonna have to take quite a bit the other nutrient that is beneficial especially for ms
is vitamin d3 so that could be another thing that can help you but realize that if you
take too much vitamin d you may have lower blood pressure and many times with pots the
person has very low blood pressure so taking more vitamin d can drop your blood pressure even lower
but vitamin d is great for people with high blood pressure so in summary b1 is very very important
the other point i want to mention is the more carbohydrate that you consume
the more b1 that you're going to need so it could be that when you also consume
more carbohydrates you have more of the symptom because it's going to aggravate and worsen the b1
deficiency all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

let's talk about loss of smell you have several situations you could have a total loss of smell
a distorted sense of smell or a reduced ability to smell smells and this could happen from an
infection like virus from the covid an injury an allergy and there could be other causes as well
now the key trace mineral for smell in general is zinc if you're deficient in zinc you lose your
smell and i've done videos on this but what if you take the zinc and you still have a problem what
can you do well let's talk about what's involved first we have this olfactory nerve but really
it's called an olfactory bulb which is just brain tissue inside your head behind your sinuses and it
processes everything connected with the perception of smell so you have receptors in your sinuses
you have quite a few you have like 10 million receptors in each sinus that pick up information
and drive it into the brain into the olfactory bulb where it's processed so if there's injury
a viral infection or an allergy that can alter this to a certain degree
what can you do well there's a couple things you can do i would definitely recommend taking zinc
that may not handle 100 percent but vitamin b1 a special type of b1 it's a fat soluble called
benzotimine works very well for all types of neuropathy including peripheral neuropathy from
either diabetes or chemotherapy there's even another condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome and that comes usually from drinking a lot of alcohol where you deplete your b1
one of the symptoms is loss of smell so this is something i would highly recommend taking and you
can take four capsules per day and just i'm not going to get into the brands you can research that
in addition to that i would take alpha lipoic acid both of these work very well together to
help support any type of neuropathy problem so if you have a loss of smell go ahead and try this
combination and comment down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how

hey guys in this video we're going to talk about the dangers of low sodium another name for this
hyponatremia okay so this this is a situation where you're losing a lot of blood volume and you
have a low blood pressure a lot of other symptoms that occur you can even have edema in the brain
when this happens a little swelling in the brain headaches nausea muscle cramps fainting falling
loss of appetite confusion and even more serious things like even a coma congestive heart failure
and Stroke all coming from low sodium so what do people try to do avoid salt right - constantly
pushing this thing on you but you need a certain amount of sodium you need about 1/2 to 1 point 2
grams per day okay that's like 1/4 of a teaspoon and then you of course sodium comes with chloride
as in salt and you would need about 2 to 3 to 5 point 8 grams of salt every single day so we
need some salt but I will agree that most people consume way way too much salt hidden in certain
junk foods ok but there's then there's other people who are restricting it so when you're
taking a diuretic for example you're depleting your sodium when you vomit or you're bulimic or
diarrhea excessive sweating using long distance type of exercise without replacing the sodium
could be very damaging kidney damage can create this adrenal weakness low adrenal can create this
that's why like Addison's disease where your person has a like the adrenals are so broken
down you're losing so much sodium you can have a lot of issues but the biggest thing is that
drinking too much water will create this and here's another point about drink when you are
thirsty right there's no set amount one time I had someone call I was doing its show on channel 8 in
this dietician called and she got in the big argument and then brought her husband who's MD
saying oh you're telling people to not drink all this water you need to drink all this water well
did you realize that this condition hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte balance in United
States we spend 2.6 billion every single year it could be life-threatening so we need needs
enough sodium and drinking too much water will dilute sodium to the degree that you
could actually be very deficient so the key is dis drinking you're thirsty if you're thirsty for two
gallons of water a day go for it but to force yourself to drink all this water could create
a situation it's interesting because the mineral or element sodium attracts 25 molecules of water
so wherever the sodium goes the water goes so for low in sodium well there goes the water and use
Drano and stuff out and you have heart problems and edema and all sorts of side effects so I just
wanted to bring your awareness of this and thank you so much for watching hey guys thank you so

so i wanted to do a video on mercury toxicity first thing let's talk about the symptoms muscle
weakness poor coordination which is damaged in the brain usually
peripheral neuropathy that's a problem in your fingertips or your toes where you have numbness
burning tingling tight pain or a sensation skin rashes anxiety um what's that poor memory trouble
speaking trouble hearing trouble seeing and then you also have a series of symptoms
that relate to higher amounts of adrenaline like excessive sweating tachycardia which is increased
pulse rate increased salivation high blood pressure and insomnia and that is because
mercury binds with SAMe it blocks the ability for SAMe to work maybe you've heard about or seen
sammy in certain nutritional products well sami is needed for adrenaline breakdown it's needed
to break down certain neurotransmitters and so if you can't break down adrenaline for example you
have too much adrenaline so that's one of the problems with mercury the second problem with
mercury is that it inhibits selenium especially the selenoenzymes or the enzymes that work with
selenium so mercury inhibits those enzymes which have everything to do with being an antioxidant
so for example the brain which consumes a tremendous amount of oxygen so we have a lot
of oxidation not many antioxidants you're gonna have a lot of problems with the muscle weakness
poor coordination poor memory those are all related to the brain and also you need these
enzymes with selenium to restore vitamin c and vitamin e networks so without selenium you're
going to have a much lower antioxidant network now if your child is toxic with mercury there
are some slightly different symptoms the child might have red cheeks or nose now just because
your child has red cheeks or red nose doesn't mean they have mercury toxicity but it could mean that
rashes muscle weakness and an increased sensitivity to light so these are just things
that you should be aware of so mercury toxicity number one inhibits sami and it inhibits the
enzymes with selenium so what do you do about it number one you want to avoid fish high in mercury
and that's the number one thing okay and i did a video on that recently i'll put a link down below
so you can get that data number two you may want to consider removing your dental amalgams okay
just to get that excess amount of mercury out of your body i personally did that because pretty
much every single filling was an amalgam number three start taking some selenium number four
take SAMe as a supplement number five consider taking a chelating product called edta
chelation means to bind with something so edta will bind with certain things like mercury
and pull it out of your body i did a whole video on that i'll put that link down below
and the last two uh supplements that are really powerful would be glutathione and and ac both
very powerful antioxidants to counter the increased oxidation and free radical damage
that you're going to get with mercury toxicity hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

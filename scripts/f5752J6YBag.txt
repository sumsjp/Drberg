i had an interesting question from someone that wanted to know why do i get so angry and irritable
when i start fasting okay it's a legitimate question and quite a few people have this happen
and i want to talk about exactly what's going on okay there's actually three main types of
fuel that your body actually runs off of you got sugar you got ketones over here
and then you have fatty acids okay so when someone lowers their carbs and sugars and they start
producing ketones as their main fuel they're only going to really be running on 40 of ketones
nearly 60 percent of their fuel is fatty acids the metabolic switch that makes this
all happen isn't always efficient okay if you have a history of having long-term insulin resistance
then it's going to take a while for your body to become more flexible in this transition
and in the process you might feel more irritable when you fast you might feel angry edgy
not very friendly you might have a low tolerance to stress and this is
all occurring because of two things happening in your body one is the years of insulin resistance
is making it difficult to get any glucose in the cell because you need insulin to absorb glucose
and so if you have insulin resistance you're not pulling in glucose and then when you go on a low
carb low sugar diet now you're really going to be low on glucose so you're going to be dependent on
ketones and fatty acids but the problem is your brain is the only organ that can't use fatty acids
it can only use ketones and glucose well you haven't transitioned over
to running on ketones 100 so your brain is going to suffer and this is why your mood
suffers okay so you have two solutions you can either just give it time and wait for
your body to fully adapt to the point where now you're more efficient you're more flexible
and your brain is getting on the ketones or you can just simply add some more ketones to your diet
in this transition phase so you would take some mct oil either a liquid or a powder you can also
do exogenous ketones but those are a bit expensive but realize that you're just in this transition
it's only temporary and you don't want to give up you want to push through keep lowering your carbs
and eventually you'll feel really good when you're doing fasting and when you're on a ketogenic diet

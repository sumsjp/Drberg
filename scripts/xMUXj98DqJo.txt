so i want to talk about why periodic fasting is not a good idea
and it doesn't work recently i talked to someone who was doing
fasting occasionally and they were so discouraged
and they were explaining to me why fasting was such a bad idea
because every time they would do it they would feel miserable
so this video i'm gonna explain exactly why okay so it'll be kind of a short
video you may have heard of the five and two
where you're eating whatever you want for five days and then you fast for two
days okay so that's a pattern of fasting that
is promoted don't recommend it though then you have
people that do the three day fast maybe every so often or let's say
someone does fasting one day every week or every
two weeks or they're fasting every other day
what's going to happen not for everyone but for most people if
they do this they're going to feel miserable they're
going to give up they're definitely going to think that fasting does not
work why because it takes
three to seven days for you to adapt to fat burning to adapt to
making ketones in the meantime your blood sugars are going to go on the low
side you're going to get hypoglycemia and your brain is going to suffer your
brains are going to get very irritable you're going to be grouchy and you are
not going to be a happy camper what you want to do is you want to do
fasting consistently you want to do regular intermittent
fasting okay it's going to take three to seven days
to first of all tap out a lot of this glucose in your
liver and then start tapping into your fat
fuel then what will happen your cognitive
function will be so much better you'll be more focused you'll be calm
your mood will be elevated you'll be happy that's how you do it
if you're in this boat simply follow the recommendations i have in the video down
below which kind of walk you through it and
you're going to really be glad you did that because you're going to find
that doing fasting the correct way is going to
be the difference between total success with a lot of health problems and
definitely with your cognitive function and your mood
versus feeling miserable and craving carbs

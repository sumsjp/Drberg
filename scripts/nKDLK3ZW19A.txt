thank you
hi here we are okay so
um a lot of recipes that I run into
um which actually almost everything that
I ever do I find on the web Pinterest
Google in a cookbook and I change it I
almost never
use the recipe as is because of
dietary choices or the sugars or the
flowers that are being used or whatever
but a lot of them Dr Berg
call for maple syrup which is that a yes
or no
that's a yes no we can't use it
it's no we can't use maple syrup I
didn't know what you're asking
I'm I'm just trying to concentrate
because the last recipe we made my mouth
is on fire right now from that pepper in
the sweetener video I introduced you we
introduced you to fiber yum and this is
basically fiber yum
with maple extract what do you think
it's identical to maple syrup
without this without the bad stuff
it's awesome really good it's us I would
just have pancakes right now and I have
a great pan pancakes I have a great
pancake recipe all right and I'm making
some cookies the call for maple syrup so
sounds good we're gonna drink it well is
it complex is it really hard to make
it's so easy to make it's well let's
show them let's show you okay

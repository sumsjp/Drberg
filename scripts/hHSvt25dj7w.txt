so if you're considering doing a detox you definitely need to do something
first before you start the detox to event the detox
reactions another name for detox reactions would be
a herxheimer reaction so you have like the flu-like symptoms
headache you feel sick and i've experienced that
many many times because i've done a lot of different cleanses let me just kind
of explain what happens when you detox there's a right way to do it in a wrong
way you want to balance your detox because when you start taking things
certain herbs to purge poisons from the body or
kill microbes let's just say for example you want to kill a parasite
a bacteria you want to inactivate viruses
or even break up biofilms which are little these little shells
that these bacteria hide in and you want to break that up right
what happens is that when the bacterial cell
breaks open a lot of times it'll release an
endotoxin okay and that's going to create an immune reaction
one interesting thing that an endotoxin will do
it'll turn off the bile flow through the liver and through the
bile ducts in other words it causes a condition
called cholestasis where you have a
stagnant flow of bile in the liver and bile if it's stuck inside the liver
is very toxic to the liver actually can create a lot of inflammation
it's meant to flow through the liver and out through the bile
ducts so what happens is you can get a backup of toxins in the blood and
you're going to get a whole series of immune reactions
like even a fever it reduces the glutathione
which is supposed to protect you from all the free radical damage and the
oxidation that's happening so you're thinking you're doing
something great by a detox but you're actually creating more damage
now normally you have different phases of detoxification phase one phase two
phase three and you have this poison that's
being released or comes through the body and then your
body breaks it down into a harmless water soluble particle but
phase three is all about the elimination of the toxin
through the bile ducts and out through the small intestine the endotoxin shuts
down the bile flow which also reduces phase two
and phase three so we just have this backup
of toxic waste in the body and this will definitely create
right quadrant pain now it could be either underneath the rib cage through
here or through the right side through here
it can actually refer to the upper right shoulder right here it could also
be tenderness and bloating that would be the sensation you can feel
nauseous okay there will be stool changes the
stool will float because you don't have enough bile to break down the fats
so your stool is fattier you may feel itchiness
in your palms or the feet especially at night
you can have vision changes simply because without
bile you're not going to be able to absorb the vitamin a
for the eye and that can actually change your vision or even alter the eye in a
certain way and creating dry eyes as well and the
urine typically will be a little bit darker
because you're getting excess amounts of bilirubin that's going through the blood
and filtered through the kidney simply what do you do all you do is you
take purified bile salts 30 minutes before
you take this herbal detox get the bowel
flowing then take the detox and then all the stuff will get through you
so you can even then take purified bile salts
about an hour later as well but the key is just to make sure that your bile
ducts are open you're making bile salts and there's a nice flow through there
and then if you start to notice more of this reaction just take a little
bit more and that should turn off those symptoms

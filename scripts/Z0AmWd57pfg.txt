let's talk about why you're really deficient in vitamin d and why is it so hard to get vitamin
d well number one it's very difficult if not impossible to get vitamin d from
your diet unless you have fatty fish every single day so this is why we rely on the sun
well let's take a look at how much vitamin d you can get from the sun well 10 minutes of
the sun can provide a thousand international units right actually a thousand international units is
very tiny but you're only going to get this 1000 i use only if you live close to the equator okay
and if you're young the older you are the more difficult it is to penetrate through the skin
apparently the skin becomes thicker and if you're not obese the more fat you have in your body the
less penetration sun has to your skin and if you have more light colored skin the darker the skin
the more the melanin the less vitamin d gets through the skin and if it's in the middle of
the day and you're lying down versus standing up if you're standing up the sun rays kind of get the
top of your head but they don't get the whole body and of course you have to have a healthy liver
and enough bile to be able to break down this fat soluble vitamin and don't forget you can't
have clouds and you can't have pollution and you can't have any genetic defect with your
vitamin d receptor which by the way is more common than you might think and also if you
don't have any gut problems any inflammation any past gut problems because inflammation blocks the
absorption of vitamin d and lastly if there's enough microbiome and you have a gallbladder
the microbes the friendly bacteria in your gut make a secondary type of bile
which helps you absorb vitamin d so number one we need enough bacteria to make secondary bile
as well as the gall bladder to be able to store and concentrate this bile to help you break down
this fat soluble nutrient so this is why so many people are deficient and it's actually
very difficult to get enough vitamin d unless you don't have a lot of these issues right here so if

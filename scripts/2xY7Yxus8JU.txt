so today we're gonna talk about vitamin D bile and your gallbladder and an
interesting connection now vitamin D is probably one of the most important
vitamins yet it is one of the most common vitamin deficiencies on this
planet vitamin D has a lot to do with bone growth if you're deficient as an
infant you could develop scoliosis kyphosis which is hunchback flat feet
all sorts of structural problems and sleep disorders blood sugar problems
immune problems inflammatory conditions specifically like arthritis rheumatoid
arthritis and all the autoimmune diseases vitamin D is involved in
cardiovascular problems especially high blood pressure
one simple remedy to draw blood pressures to take enough vitamin D you
would want about thirty to forty thousand IU's per day your brain needs
vitamin D to work now in your mind you might think you're getting enough
vitamin D from your diet which it's almost impossible to achieve now vitamin
D is present in fish fatty fish maybe a little bit in mushrooms cod liver oil
and a few other foods but it is almost impossible to get your vitamin D from
your diet now son we can definitely get vitamin D
but if you're older if you have certain health problems like diabetes or your
skin is a little bit darker you're gonna need a lot more Sun to achieve your
requirements for vitamin D then what you do in the winter well you would take
supplements but what I want to talk about is number three absorption of
vitamin D there are other nutrients that help absorb vitamin D like magnesium b6
and even vitamin k2 but if you have malabsorption you're gonna have a very
difficult time absorbing vitamin D so the inside of the colon is damaged from
maybe years of antibiotics or junk food that alone is going to make you
deficient if you have some type of inflammatory condition you're gonna have
huge barrier up holding in that vitamin D but the other thing I want to mention
is the gallbladder normally your liver makes bile and it
flows down and gets stored into the gallbladder
so the gallbladder concentrates bile the bile is necessary to act as a detergent
to help you extract fat soluble vitamins from your food without a gallbladder
you're gonna have a difficult time absorbing vitamin D from the diet or if
there's gall stones or if there's a lack of bile itself you're not gonna be able
to absorb vitamin D efficiently and that could come from many things including a
fatty liver which a lot of people have then we have B which is viral infections
certain viruses have a strategy of downgrading the vitamin D receptor the
VDR apparently they are very intelligent and they know that we need
vitamin D desperately to make sure our immune system works but what they do is
they start downgrading this receptor so now the vitamin D can't get absorbed
cortisol which comes from stress and certain medications as in prednisone
cortisol cream can block the vitamin D receptor too so that's another barrier
then we have something called polymorphism now what is that that is a
mutation or an alteration in the gene that is part of this receptor so now
that you know the barriers let's talk about some solutions but I want to
actually teach you a new word we know that VDR stands for vitamin D receptor
but the word agonist it's something that connects that makes everything work and
the opposite of an agonist would be an antagonist okay something that would
block the function what would be a vdr agonist well vitamin D in higher amounts
so when you take higher amounts I'm talking 30 40 50 60 70 thousand IU's of
vitamin D that can sometimes override this problem right here
even this problem right here if there's a problem with a downgraded receptor or
some blockage sometimes you just need to take more next one is benicar this is
a medication which I'm not recommending but there's an interesting protocol
called the Marshall protocol I'll put a link down below in which they're using
this medication which is a medication they used for blood pressure to help the
absorption of vitamin D to help treat autoimmune disorders and of course my
viewpoint is this is there some alternative to medication that can be
used as a vdr agonist well guess what we'll do it bile salts bile salts are a
natural vdr agonist so bile salts will help the absorption of vitamin D and I
will put a link down below so anytime you're dealing with inflammatory
conditions or very resistant conditions that you know will respond to vitamin D
but there's some type of barrier you can also add some purified bile salts to
enhance the absorption simply because bile can act as a VDR agonist thanks for
watching
Hey were back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto absolutely not Karen and
it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you

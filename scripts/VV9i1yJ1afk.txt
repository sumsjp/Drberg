hey it's dr. Berg and in this video we're going to be joined by his lovely wife
Karen and we're going to prepare some treats for you today some really quick
very simple high nutrition high-protein snacks right so in this video we're
going to we're going to make something very very cool and delicious what are we
making we're gonna make almond fudge in a jar yes now right so we're going to
this whole recipe is based on the foundation of my new instant kale shake
now the difference between this shake and this shake that we previously use is
two things number one it has 20 grams of protein per serving size high-quality
protein this has 6 grams of protein and it's double the size so that's the
difference so how are we going to make this what's the first step in this in
this concoction I think it's almond butter that is
correct 16 ounces of almond butter yeah so we take a like a smaller size of
almond butter at a health food store and we are going to no sugar no sugar you have
to read the ingredients because I'm telling you peanut butter almond butter
they always put that added sugar or high-fructose corn syrup
tell you what I'm gonna guide you Karen I'm gonna guide okay so we got the
almond butter yeah good now I'm gonna instruct what we do right so now it's
always important to clean up the mess as we go Karen because that's really
important okay good Karen actually is the pro cleaner I'm
actually the litter bug in the house secondly we have two scoops of the kale
shake right here we already measured with the scoop you want to show those
good yeah it's just it's just one of these okay do you guys now so now we
have we have in the way of protein 20 grams of protein we have the sweetener
we have chocolate and nothing else okay now we're going to do is we're going to
add in the coconut oil 1/3 cup of coconut oil now the difference between
coconut oil and coconut butter it's there's no difference it's the same
thing okay coconut oil coconut butter same thing okay so we got that now we're
going to use 1/4 of a teaspoon of sea salt if if we don't have it in the oh
wait actually have it already it's in the almond butter so we don't have to
add it sometimes like a little pinch extra okay all right we're going to use
that but sometimes if it has salt you don't need it depends on your taste now
we're going to add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract we get the one without
the sugar of course teaspoon of vanilla good so now we're going to add just for
the fun we're going to add Lily's brand chocolate chips these are flavored we
are sweetened with stevia we're going to put two heaping tablespoons yes yep yeah
this is amazing you can get this for online you can get it at Whole Foods ok
can it really be this simple it's so simple
yeah we're just going to mix these ingredients we're going to throw it in
the jar now the thing is that if it came in this container and we added the other
ingredients it's going to make you a little bit more than this container so
we're going to have to either get a bigger container or just have some extra
on the side so we like to use a messenger drink our mason jars water
glass so we have ton of them
it's very simple we put it in the jar and then we're going to put this in the
refrigerator and then we basically it's our snack through the day if you want a
little treat just take a tablespoon of it does it all fit yeah Wow okay good
awesome okay so now we're going to do put the lid on it okay now we're going
to stick this in the refrigerator and wait about an hour and then we're going to
taste it okay all right yep all right what are we eating this is the chocolate
fudge in a jar almond fudge in a jar now it's really good when it's
kind of hard
mmm that's delicious honestly it tastes like almond butter with chocolate this
is different and high-protein that's a chocolate you have to mix a little bit
better all right we're back Karen didn't like the last version so we've made a
completely new version and we added a little bit more coconut oil just a tiny
bit yeah so we're gonna it was a little too um peanut buttery tacky and I like
it smooth and creamy and fudge is creamy it needed to be creamy okay so we're
going to sample this out we're just going to test it and and also if you
leave it the refrigerator long enough for it all to blend together and for the
coconut oil to firm up it makes a difference too okay so what make sure
don't put on this too tight let me just tap this down here of course this helped
okay so let me try this
you know what I would do well I would add some nut more nuts in them but I
like it so some depending what you like you don't like yours you like your
smooth well we use um chunky peanut butter so it's plenty of nuts I think I
want to fill it with nuts it's pretty good so you can keep this in the fridge
and have a snack and then you can seal it up and you know store it mm-hmm it'll
be good for at least two weeks to six months Wow
so try it out it won't last for two weeks or six months right right - I know right
low shelf life okay so try it out put your comments below and let us know how
you like it

you know i've talked a lot about grains blocking zinc because of the anti-nutrient phytic acid
but did you know that nuts also have phytic acid and actually has quite a bit
of course most people consume more grains than they do nuts but the anti-nutrient phytic acid
has the ability to bind with zinc and block it from being absorbed in our bodies it binds with
iron phosphorus magnesium calcium chromium copper and manganese so if you're consuming a lot of
phytic acid you can end up being deficient also phytic acid inhibits certain enzymes that help
you digest protein like pepsin and trypsin also a starch enzyme called amylase so these things
are blocked now let's say for example we had a hundred grams of nuts brazil nuts take the lead
with the most phytic acid it has 1790 milligrams of phytic acid then almonds with 1400 milligrams
then walnuts with 982 milligrams peanuts with 952 milligrams of phytic acid and then we have
hazelnuts with 648 milligrams of phytic acid and so there's quite a bit of this anti-nutrient in
nuts so what you need to know is there are ways to reduce phytic acid number one just not consume
as much also realize that your own gut has certain microbes that can make the enzyme phytase that can
break down phytic acid okay so that's good so you might not even have any issue with this at
all but if you germinate your nuts that means you soak them overnight dry them out and consume them
you're going to reduce phytic acid i talked about this in my book also if you boil or pressure cook
nuts you're going to actually reduce the phytic acid now realize this one point in order for
phytic acid to bind with zinc it has to be in the same mixture okay so let's say for example
you start eating red meat or other foods okay and you start getting the benefit of zinc then you eat
nuts after that and so it's not exactly the same mixture okay you'll probably be somewhat
okay because zinc has to be exposed or connected to phytic acid also if you're including a lot
more foods higher in zinc and a lot less foods lower in phytic acid you're going to be in good
shape like seafood oysters are at the top of the list red meats very very high amounts of zinc and
fish have a good amount of zinc so i just want to increase your awareness on other things that
can deplete your zinc and that's because zinc is a very very important trace mineral hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on
this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune
system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system

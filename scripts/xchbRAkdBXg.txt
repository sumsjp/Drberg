so today i'm going to talk about another reason why people
are deficient in vitamin c that is quite interesting
i've done a lot of videos on the diet connection to vitamin c
sauerkraut it has the most vitamin c like 700 milligrams
per cup then you have bell peppers and chili peppers and
leafy greens and berries lemons and limes and then we have sugar
if you're consuming sugar and vitamin c at the same time even if
you're eating food with vitamin c the body's gonna absorb sugar and not
vitamin c thereby creating a deficiency and so the
chemistry of sugar and vitamin c is very very similar
and the body will always take the sugar first so that would be one
cause of the deficiency another cause would be insulin resistance this is very
very common most people have this condition and if
you have it you're not going to be able to pull vitamin c into the body
and one of the first signs of a vitamin c deficiency is fatigue
too so that's a it's a real big one but this last cause of a vitamin c
deficiency is very interesting pollution if you're living in a city
that's polluted that's going to majorly decrease the
amount of vitamin c in your body there's a significant correlation
between people living in polluted cities and very low vitamin c in their
blood now vitamin c is a very powerful
antioxidant especially for your lungs the lower respiratory organ there's
higher risk of respiratory effects and increased mortality from respiratory
disease in polluted areas not just from the
pollution but from the pollution creating a
deficiency of vitamin c now that also correlates with other
studies on smokers smokers require a lot more vitamin c
because smoke in general going through the lungs
depletes your vitamin c reserves and because vitamin c is so
necessary for the immune system especially in the lungs you're going to
have if you have a vitamin c deficiency
deficiency of antibodies that actually help protect you against
pathogens decrease the amount of neutrophils which are like your front
line of defense against microbes decrease b cells which
help make antibodies decrease t cells decrease interferon
which is the weapon against viruses and there's many other
immune effects as well the city with the worst air pollution in
the united states is san juan king valley
it just so happens that they have one of the highest death rates of lower
respiratory disease probably because the combination of the
pollution and the lower amount of vitamin c
now if we take the top polluted cities in the world
India ranks number one and then we have Pakistan and then China now if you smoke
or you live in a city that's very polluted i would highly recommend
you start consuming a lot more vitamin c so you can offset
this deficiency that the smoke from pollution or
smoking has created thanks for watching before you go if you have a question

hey guys in this video we're going to talk about receding gums and vitamin C
receding gums is a vitamin C deficiency so let's talk about that vitamin C has a
lot to do with protein building specifically collagen and when you lose
the collagen your gums start to recede and there's too much tooth and there's
not enough gum if you look at the arteries for example and you get a
little lesion or a leaky space between the little cells
that's a vitamin C deficiency because you're losing the collagen Junction so
vitamin C helps those cellular junctions become really really tight in your
intestines you need vitamin C to keep the the junctions tight prevent leaky
gut leaky gut is normally a vitamin C deficiency okay
so bacteria for example do they're a negative effect through proteolytic
enzymes basically those are enzymes to break down proteins vitamin C counters
the effect of the proteolytic enzymes so basically that's why when you're sick
and you take vitamin C you get better because they reduce the toxic effect
from bacteria in fact the white blood cell which is your immune cell has more
vitamin C carries more vitamin C than any other cell in the body because it
needs this vitamin C to protect you so when you brush your teeth in it and you

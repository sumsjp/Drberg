had some questions about gallstones and the gallbladder someone wanted to know if
they're a vegan and they didn't want to take the purified bile salts what could they do
so this video is for them but it's also for those people that have a history of gallstones that has
a lot of gallbladder issues that maybe is missing a gallbladder or has a lot of bloating or right
shoulder pain these are three of my most favorite herbs all right number one is collinsonia root
another name for that is called stone root colon sonia root is also really good for hemorrhoids
which is like a varicose vein in your rectum and it's good for varicose veins in general anywhere
in the body just increases uh circulation through the liver and throughout the vascular system
colon sonia root is also good for upper respiratory infections but what i like to
recommend it for is to relax the bile ducts so it usually when you have gall stones you have
the super concentrated cholesterol and you have a lack of bile and so you get a lot of congestion
and sludge so collinsonia root opens up these ducts to allow things to flow nicely through the
different tubes connecting from your liver to your small intestine also it can increase urine flow
and it can decrease risk of kidney stones next one is slippery elm bark it's been used for thousands
of years it's good for a fever swollen throat and it turns into a gel in the body so it's very
sticky so it'll attach to different things so it's good for a lot of things from inflammation your
colon to even decreasing gallstones and making the bile thinner because what causes the gallstone
is the concentration of cholesterol because you're missing this bile and if you're missing the bile
and the cholesterol is more concentrated it turns into a sludge and it can definitely prevent the
flow of bile going through your body so slippery elm bark will help the flow of bile as well as
the flow of cholesterol through the body all right and last one is spanish black radish
spinach like radish is a very strong radish and you can get this in a supplement or you can even
put it on your salad because they have them at the health store it can stimulate bioflow and a
gallstone is there because you don't have enough bile where there's damage in the liver or some
other reason spanish black radish can just help you produce more bile it has strong detoxification
functions sulforaphane which is a phytonutrient which is amazing in its anti-cancer properties
but the spanish black radish has four times the sulforaphane then other cruciferous
vegetables so it's a super detoxifier and so you don't just get a higher production
of bile but you get more detoxification as well so these are my favorite but
if you're not a vegan i would recommend that you also take purified bile salts all right there you
have it the three top herbs that can support your gallbladder before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto

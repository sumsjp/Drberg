let's talk about some of the really interesting benefits from the Sun that
go beyond just vitamin D so as you know when the Sun hits your skin there's
certain chemical reactions that occur that generate vitamin D from cholesterol
in your skin so people are always against cholesterol but you need
cholesterol to actually make vitamin D okay so there's a lot of benefits to
cholesterol but check this out when the Sun hits your skin and the
retina okay through your eye you get a chemical conversion of increasing
serotonin and serotonin can greatly affect your mood this is why of course
when you're in the Sun you feel much better and when the winter comes and
it's dark you don't feel that great if it goes on and on
in fact when I originally graduated from college I wanted to go and live in
Washington State okay it was just beautiful there and I just loved the
whole scenery and and how green the grass was well little did I know the
reason why it's so green is it rained so much in fact for six months I don't
think the Sun came out at all and I got really depressed so I moved from
Washington State down to California actually right next to the Mojave Desert
to dry out all the Sun and my mood definitely went up so there is a
relationship between the Sun and your mood via certain hormones okay number
two it effects melatonin actually reduces melatonin melatonin is the
hormone that helps you sleep so darkness stimulates melatonin but
light Sun will decrease this this makes you sleepy so the Sun wakes you up okay
so another benefit number three the heat from the Sun and the humidity that's
generated from the Sun and also the environment has the power to decrease
viral loads even from COVID-19 and this is why you're going to see as you go
into the summer you're going to find that a lot of people are going to do
much much better simply because the reproduction of that virus is affected
by the temperature and the humidity of the environment and this is why these
viruses a lot of times are seasonal like influenza comes out in the winter but
kind of goes away in the summer now number four UV this is a wavelength that
you're getting from the Sun that has antibacterial effects and this has
nothing to do with vitamin d UV inhibits the growth of certain bacteria and other
microbes even through glass it can actually inhibit tetanus typhoid TB
staph strep and many other microorganisms are number five the Sun
will increase resistance to infection so it helps your immune system alright
number six the infrared wavelength of the Sun is great for wound healing and
decreasing pain there's many different types of therapy using infrared and if
you haven't seen the benefits of vitamin D from the Sun you got to check that out
I put it right here

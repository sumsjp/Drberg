hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the absolute worst weight loss habit
do you have any guesses and what this could be eating at night when you're not hungry okay so
what happens is you get home at night you eat then you start watching TV and then you sit in
the couch and then you start eating but you're not really hungry but if you were hungry what
you should do is you should basically add more fat to that dinner so you can go longer but most
people that I know are not even hungry so this is a really bad habit because we're going to spike
insulin by the time you sit down or the time to go to bed and it's not just grazing on nuts I think
people like the texture of pistachios or different nuts or potato chips salty or maybe sweet things
and they just have to have that sensation you know when the watching TV or something like that
so it's very very deadly because you're doing it almost like on an automatic maybe you like
ice cream at night and the texture you know of the buttery cream with the coldness well here's
the problem it's just a massive spike of insulin I know as a kid I used to work at a theater when
I was 16 and I used to take popcorn home to my dad and he would sit in from the TV and I swear
I was a garbage bag like this much he would just keep eating constantly popcorn right by the time
he sat down by the time I went to bed a lot of insulin spike so it's a real bad habit and so
what you have first thing you have to do is you just have to be aware of what you're doing and
what it's creating as far as a bad effect and the next thing you have to do is you have to determine
am I really hungry okay and if you are hungry just add more fat at the dinner so you go longer
if you're craving foods that's a whole different thing that means that your breakfast has to be
corrected you have to watch them my videos and what to eat for breakfast because that that will
usually get rid of the cravings but if you're not craving you're not hungry and you're just sticking
things in your mouth for some type of pleasure you're going to have to keep yourself busy doing
something else now you can chew gum you could as a gradient maybe you snack on celery sticks
allow yourself to have as many celery sticks as you want or find something to do other watch TV
that keeps yourself busy active and you can put awareness on it and just focus on not eating
anything because it is a big bad problem that you have to get rid of alright thanks for watching

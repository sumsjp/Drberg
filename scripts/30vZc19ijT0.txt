so this is a tip on the fastest way to get rid of knee pain in fact you can use this on any type of
arthritis stiffness in your lower back and your shoulders and your neck it's something that i
found with my patients when i was in practice it's so common and it's such a no-brainer
you may already know this but it's really the elimination of the omega-6 fatty acids and
the replacement with those fats with the omega-3 fatty acids now now very simply you need to avoid
any type of vegetable oils in your diet the soy oil the canola the cottonseed oil the corn oil
and this also includes these oils in chips and bread and crackers corn chips potato chips now
for some people it might seem like a a real subtle little thing but it creates a huge change in your
overall inflammation simply because omega-6 fatty acids are probably the most common reason
why people have inflammation and these fats are in so many foods in the grocery store the mayonnaise
the salad dressings the soups and this also includes safflower oil and sunflower oil so if you
are going to use an oil to cook with butter olive oil coconut oil now a couple of the things that
you might not be aware of um the nuts and seeds peanut butter nut butters are all high in omega-6
and also out of all the meats chicken has the highest amount of omega-6 so
consuming too much chicken can push you over the edge with omega-6 fatty acids tofu by
the way is also high in omega-6 so if you were just to kind of eliminate a lot of those foods
and increase the omega-3 fatty acids which is highly anti-inflammatory that would be the fatty
fish salmon definitely do wild caught sardines other fatty fish shellfish cod liver oil are
the foods that you need to focus on and another very simple home test that you can do with just
like a one drop of blood you can send it in is an omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid profile i'll put a link

relatively inexpensive and you just use a drop of your blood so anyway that's my tip on arthritis

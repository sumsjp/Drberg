so let's talk about the many benefits of ginseng I recently had some questions
about ginseng like what is it I know I've heard about it but I don't know
what it does well it's been around the block for a couple years
try like 2,000 years so it's been used in Chinese medicine and it's mainly a
super tonic so it does a lot of things to increase your vitality and it's
usually good for men over 50 as well as women who are going through menopause
but now a lot of these benefits I'm going to talk about come from this one
phytonutrient it's a plant-based chemical called ginseng aside and
there's a tremendous amount of research on this vital nutrient for a lot of
different things some of the main benefits for ginseng and it's quite
extensive is increasing your vitality your memory your energy of course
supporting insulin and blood sugars so that's gonna actually handle a lot of
other associated things helping you to be more alert and focused yet calm and
there's also some great studies on its supporting testosterone and all the
benefits of having that especially if you're over 50 so some of the studies
I'm going to quote I'm gonna put a link down below study the effects of this
phytonutrient on the brain and it has anti amyloid properties which is very
very cool because as you may know amyloid plaque occurs in Alzheimer's
patients so that is a big problem and it's always difficult finding some
natural way to reduce amyloid plaque in also there's some fantastic research in
this plant-based chemical supporting arrhythmias talking about atrial
fibrillation palpitations and other benefits to your heart I included
another study of its supporting hippocampus now the hippocampus is a
structure in your brain that is basically a relay switch in memories and
spatial memory helping you locate yourself in time and space also there's
some great data on alleviating depression that's probably why it gives
you energy and it makes you more alert so it has a lot to do with supporting
the cognitive function and some of the chemistry and ginseng acts like a
steroid and all of the sex hormones our steroids alright guys thanks for

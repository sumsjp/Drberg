i had another question from someone that wanted to know why
am i getting gout in my big toe why isn't it in my left shoulder so we're going to cover that today
first of all what is gout that is a situation where you have uric acid crystals that are
depositing in certain joints okay and it's causing pain now what causes this to happen
is a mystery in fact researchers have a big problem trying to understand this because
the minority of people with gout attacks have high uric acid so in other words
the 10 of the population that has high uric acid only a half a percent point five percent of them
get the actual gout attacks okay so that's kind of a mystery you would think it would just be
the opposite and on top of that most of the gout attacks occur when people have normal levels of
uric acid the other point about this is the uric acid crystals are not in the exact location of
where the person is feeling the inflammation in other words they're located in the extracellular
area okay the inflammation is inside the cell so that throws a little wrench into the whole
theory and so what they basically concluded from that is that it's an immune reaction
that is transmitting through this membrane so your immune system is reacting to the uric acid
crystals creating inflammation and they also know that people with gout they have a problem
eliminating uric acid from the kidney so the kidney is not getting rid of uric acid and
that could be from various reasons it could be because you're diabetic or pre-diabetic or have
insulin resistance and that alone weakened the kidneys because kidneys are a target
from having high amounts of sugar in the diet and they also know that these gut attacks occur
usually at night after you have consumed alcohol like beer especially beer meat seafood organ meats
fructose things that are high in purine which then gets converted to uric acid through a very
specific enzyme which i'm going to come back to in a little bit but the point is that there's certain
foods that can trigger this reaction okay so now the question is why does it attack the big toe
well because of this these uric acid crystals that are developing and depositing in the body
are dependent on ph and temperature in other words if your ph is too acidic like your urine
is like like 5.7 or in that range you'll start developing these crystals and if your temperature
is a little more on the cooler side you can get more flare-ups from gout now i have a
question what part of your body is typically the coldest part of your body is it around your heart
no it's in your toes or your fingertips that's where they get gout they can actually get it in
the fingertips too but usually in the big toe so apparently out of all your toes the big toe
is the coldest part of your body all right so what can you do about this condition
there's some natural remedies number one celery celery has a certain chemical
that inhibits that enzyme i told you about which is converting purine to uric acid it's called
xanthine oxidase so celery blocks that enzyme so you don't get the accumulation of uric acid that
would be number one number two is coffee now i'm not telling you to drink a lot of coffee i'm just
telling you the coffee bean not the caffeine can also decrease that enzyme but i'm only going to
recommend drinking one cup per day in the morning the next remedy is tart cherry directly decreases
inflammation from the reaction from the uric acid crystals so it influences the immune inflammatory
reaction now also to help you become more alkaline there's two things one is to drink lemon juice so
you might say wait a second lemon juice is acidic citric acid how is that going to alkalize me
well it just so happens that when you consume citrates from lemon juice it oxidizes and it turns
alkaline in the body okay you can also alkalize your body from things like potassium citrate and
that can help reduce the attacks from gout also lemon has vitamin c which can actually inhibit
gout attacks and then the other thing you can do is you can start consuming more vegetables
and keep your protein moderate because those vegetables will not only alkalize you they can
help reduce the gout attacks now there are purines in certain vegetables and things like mushrooms
but they will not trigger the gout attack now one last point i want to bring up fasting can increase
uric acid okay now why does fasting increase uric acid because when you fast you recycle certain
proteins okay it's called autophagy like nucleic acids which are high in purine which can then
increase uric acid but uric acid in the body is one of the most powerful antioxidants in
your blood so as your body is healing in the fasting mode you're increasing more uric acid
to actually act as one of the antioxidants in the healing process all right thanks for watching
and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

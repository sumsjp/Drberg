so today we're going to talk about lactation insufficiency
so you just started to breastfeed and you're finding out there's just not
enough milk and so what do you do in this situation
well most people will do the natural remedies
fenugreek blessed thistle alfalfa brewer's yeast
or fennel seed and if you take these it might actually help produce more milk
but what if it doesn't work what's going on and what do you do
now the ducts in the breast tissue are regulated by
estrogen and growth hormone and the actual breast tissue requires
progesterone and prolactin so you need a combination of
all these hormones working together now if there has been
a chronic nutritional deficiency you may find
that the actual structures in the breast tissue are altered enough
where these remedies are not going to work right away so what can you do
the ideal scene would be to have you eat a certain way about two years before
you're pregnant and that way going into pregnancy you
would have no nutritional deficiencies and you would probably have no problem
with breastfeeding so i just wanted to emphasize the vital importance
of what a mother eats when she's pregnant even before she's pregnant
and when she's lactating that is so so important for the future
health of the child so if you've already passed pregnancy and now you're trying
to breastfeed you can still do a lot but you need to
fix the diet you need to absolutely go low carb
and the foods that you eat need to be nutrient dense
vitally important there could be either a subclinical pcos polycystic ovarian
syndrome that's kind of underneath the radar that's messing with your hormones
because this is simply high levels of insulin that's
making too much antigen and the antigen is throwing off these
hormones right here now it also could be a hypothyroid
condition and most hypothyroid conditions are
autoimmune hashimoto's however when you're pregnant what's
interesting is the autoimmune diseases tend to turn off like a switch so you
may find that if you had hypothyroid condition
before you're pregnant you may not have the symptoms right now
but if you don't have an autoimmune
condition you have another reason why you have hypothyroid
this could come from high levels of estrogen again related to
hormones the higher the estrogen the lower
the thyroid but iodine is the secret for that if you're taking enough iodine
while you're pregnant or even when you're breastfeeding this
can help regulate the estrogen and help the thyroid but it's very
important to lower the carbohydrate in the diet
and have foods that are nutrient dense if you're new to my channel i put a link
down below of how to do that and you have to realize that in order to
turn this around it could take some time so you may want
to contact your local leleche league and get
someone to donate the milk as you correct your body and help to
reverse some of the stuff so you can actually start producing the
milk on your own so it's a combination of getting your diet corrected and also
taking a few of these right here i like this one the best i would
probably stick with this and this one right here
these other ones also have been known to create some good effects
the other point i want to bring up is this point right here you don't
ever want to do synthetic prenatals why because it's just low quality vitamins
you want to get some type of food based prenatal
and they have them not going to recommend any brand you're going to have
to research that but the synthetics just use very very low
quality ingredients and there's a big difference between synthetic
and natural vitamins or whole food vitamins
if you've already been doing this well just switch to something more natural
the key nutrients to take while you're pregnant and while you're breastfeeding
are definitely vitamin d cod liver oil you can get them in little pearls
and trace minerals now other vitamins as well but these three
are the most important to fortify your body
so this infant has the best chance of getting all the nutrients they need
all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a
debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the US
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

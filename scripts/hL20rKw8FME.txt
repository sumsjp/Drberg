hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about the alkaline cancer protection myth
the one that goes that you need to alkalize your body to prevent cancer okay another one of those
things that everyone knows but it really doesn't make sense and I'm going to explain why first the
first question I always ask people is what part of the body are you talking about that you need
alkalis is it the stomach is it the large bowel is the saliva it is that the urine is it the blood
every single part of your body has a different pH are they saying that you need to alkalize the
entire body we need to bring it beyond the normal level of pH that it should be so people really
can't answer that but cancer will also grow in an alkaline medium now it is true that tumors do
grow faster in an acid environment but tumors and cancer make acid cancers not caused by an acidic
environment it's the cancer in tumors that are causing the acidic environment that makes sense
so you see the differentiation there there really there's no study that shows that if you alkalize
the body you're going to reduce the risk of cancer that's not how it works now there's nothing wrong
with consuming alkaline foods in fact it's not the alkalinity that's doing the good things from
vegetables it's basically cruciferous vegetables which are highly alkaline inhibit what's called
angiogenesis which is which is the development of new blood vessels to tumors and cancer if you
shut up their blood supply they won't exist anymore it just so happens those vegetables
have the power to inhibit the new formation of blood vessels to that new entity and also all
the final nutrients in the vegetables are very anti-cancer but it has nothing to do with the
alkalinity okay so that makes sense all right well thank you so much for watching Hey I thank you so

do you want to know what food has the highest calcium cheese and specifically parmesan cheese
now there's other types of cheeses that are high in calcium but
parmesan cheese has the most calcium of any food which is interesting you can also get calcium
from leafy greens nuts seeds things like that but cheese will give you the most calcium now
if you have a prostate problem or you have high estrogen levels or a fibroid if you're female
you want to get your calcium from other sources not cheese because too much cheese can actually
swell up the prostate and cause difficulty urinating as well as getting up too frequently
through the night so i'm not suggesting that you just start consuming cheese but you know a little
bit of cheese would give you a good amount of calcium especially parmesan cheese now that's
all interesting but what is calcium good for most people talk about bone health which is true and
preventing muscle cramps which is absolutely true because you need calcium as the part of
the contraction mechanism in your muscles as well as magnesium for relaxation but mainly
calcium as the contraction part of a muscle cycle but also blood clotting you need calcium
from blood clotting but it has another very very important purpose that i want to bring up
which has to do with supporting your cellular membranes okay and specifically cell signaling
and another interesting point is in a plant calcium has everything to do with supporting
the membranes of a plant cell so without calcium you get all sorts of holes in the membrane and
it makes things fragile and it creates all sorts of additional issues but with our body
it really makes that cellular membrane very very strong and it regulates the resealing mechanism
the repair mechanism of that cell membrane which is a bilayer or double layer of fat
so whether there's mechanical damage from exercise or trauma to the cell membranes or
chemical damage okay from pesticides whatever or alcohol or infection virus bacterial fungus
or a lack of oxygen from a blood clot or a heart attack or just free radical damage in general
which leaves the membrane with little holes in it or damage calcium comes in there and
helps to regulate this process to help reseal it and so this is one of the big problems with
calcium if you have chronic damage to your cell membranes as in chronic inflammation
you get calcium buildup in the tissues in the joints and inside the arteries
in the brain on the eyes so calcium is part of the healing process or in repair process
and so anytime you see calcium deposits anywhere in the body realize it has to do with chronic
inflammation and an overstimulation of this healing mechanism that occurs
and so then people start taking vitamin k2 to remove the calcium and they start to avoid calcium
what they really need to do is address the inflammation and to do that you need to re address
a lot of things you have to take a holistic approach but anyway i wanted to emphasize the
great importance calcium has in our body and the big function that a lot of people don't know about
maintaining cell membrane repair and health hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

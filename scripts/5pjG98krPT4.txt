here's a good question can you actually grow your muscles when you're doing
intermittent fasting and keto now i have done other videos on
this but i want to go more into the exercise part of this because
if you're doing intermittent fasting and keto
and you're not doing exercise you're not going to grow your muscles
okay why because the most important stimulus to muscle hypertrophy
which is growing muscle is the intensity of the exercise
okay intensity of the exercise now before i get into the exercise part i
want to talk about the foundation that surrounds this because
when you do intermittent fasting consistently and you're actually
adapted to ketosis you will have higher levels of human growth hormone
and human growth hormone does cause the growth of muscle and it also
prevents the loss of muscle now on the opposite spectrum if you're
eating frequently through the day and you have insulin resistance and you
have blood sugar issues or you're pre-diabetic or diabetic
you're going to have less amino acids going into that muscle
you're going to have more atrophy so this is an important principle to
consume two meals a day maybe even one meal a
day but i think two meals a day would be perfect
maybe keep your carbs at the higher end but not over that about 50 grams
per day because it is true that carbohydrates do stimulate insulin and
insulin is an anabolic hormone however we don't want to go too high
because we're trying to prevent insulin resistance
so if we provide the the top limit of carbs i think that would be a smart
thing to do and of course we want to make sure that
we have enough complete protein for the muscles to
choose from but not go too much so seven to eight ounces of
protein per meal would be a really good option what you
have to realize is that when you consume protein whether
it's meat fish or eggs or whatever minimally at
least half of that is wasted as glucose fuel because it
protein turns in the glucose or as uh nitrogen waste
so you're not really absorbing 100 of that unless you're taking
certain types of amino acid blends so by adding a ton of protein with your meals
that will not help you with this it just creates more stress on your kidney
and your liver and it can actually increase your glucose a little bit too
much and of course sufficient sleep is very
very important because if you're not sleeping you increase the stress
and the hormone cortisol breaks down muscle protein now this data that i'm
going to tell you about right now is very very powerful and i got this
from an interview from dorian yates so he
actually achieved mr olympia six times so i wanted to see what he had
to say about muscle growth and i really liked his
data now it is true that most bodybuilders including him
took a lot of steroids and growth hormones
however i really um liked his philosophy on muscle growth and i think it makes a
lot of sense personally i am not doing it simply
because that's not my goal right now but i think um it's worth
looking at this is what he said now he'll start off
with some warm-up sets okay some light weight just like most
people will do that so you warm up the muscle with some lighter weights
but then he will do one insanely extremely difficult set of about six to
eight reps so he will do these reps
to total failure and beyond okay so he will go as hard as he can and then
we can't go anymore he'll get someone to spot him and assist
him with a few more reps okay so he's going beyond
total failure and that's based on this principle of
intensity right here i mean he is maximizing that
workout intensity because really what you're trying to do is you're trying to
damage the muscle you're trying to destroy that muscle
through difficulty now a couple key points to this
you want to keep perfect form okay and you don't want to recruit other
muscles and you don't want to create momentum as
you're working out you're trying to isolate one muscle
at a time to maximum failure and beyond but there's something else
that he said that is really really cool when you uh work a muscle you're gonna
let's say you're doing bench press you're gonna contract the pec
okay so you're coming out like this and then you're gonna come back
right so you have concentric movement which is contraction
then you have eccentric movement which is lengthening
so if i'm coming down on a bench press my pecs are lengthening
and the eccentric part which is the negative part
is actually stronger than the concentric part but it's often neglected
so what he does with help he will also then focus on the negative
part and bring that to failure so if you were
to have someone spot you in a bench press
and you've just did eight reps to total failure
you would have them assist you on the concentric part
okay help you lift it all the way up and then you would just bring it down
slowly okay and you would keep doing that
until you can't do it anymore to failure that way you completely and utterly
exhaust that muscle to the point where you create some
serious damage now he's only going to work that muscle
once a week he's not going to hit it tomorrow the next day
so he works at one muscle per week and here's the key you let it recover
fully 100 here's a big mistake that a lot
of people do is they work out when that muscle is incomplete but
hasn't healed so that's when you create scar tissue
and injury so this number five
allowing your muscle to recover fully is what
makes the muscle get bigger okay the exercise the intensity is just the
damage of the muscle and then you let it heal
and so then the next time you work out you're a little bit stronger
and at some point you want to keep increasing the weight more and more and
more until the muscle grows so you don't want
to go for momentum you want controlled
isolated movement with a pause so if you're doing a bench press you come all
the way to the end you pause and then come all the way back
and you come back on the eccentric part slower than this
part right here so we have some warm-ups one
intense set per exercise now he may hit that
muscle like the pec with maybe three to four to five
different exercises but he's only going to do that one
intense to total failure and beyond uh once per
week and for details and all this definitely get one of his books and you
can read up on it he works out one hour per day
only four times a week on the off days he did
cardio which actually helps the recovery now of course if you're going to do this
you do not want to jump into this right away because you can hurt yourself you
want to go into this very very gradual probably
hire a personal trainer to help you and you want to over a period of weeks
build up to this intense total failure and beyond a set but i
really think if you combine this with your keto intermittent fasting keep
your stress low good sleep you're going to be able to
get muscle hypertrophy all right and number five very important
okay this is going to get you this right here so you have to work out
intensely to create the damage in the soreness
and then you have to recover completely for you to be able to have this
occur so it might take longer than a week
it could take two weeks and sometimes maybe even three if you're just starting
out thanks for watching before you go if you
have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the u.s
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

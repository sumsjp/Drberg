now i've done a lot of videos on the b vitamins but i don't think i've ever
done a video on inositol which is vitamin b8
now they no longer classify inositol as a b vitamin because they found out
your body can make it however it is a vitamin and it's
actually quite important so your body makes uh inositol your
kidneys make inositol other parts of your body
make inositol it's most abundant in your brain
and in practice i would use it to help curb cravings to carbs
it's actually a sugar alcohol it's made from glucose
and it greatly helps insulin resistance in blood sugars and you can even suck on
it and it tastes sweet which is interesting
and large doses like 2000 milligrams twice a day if you add a little folate
to it you can see some serious improvements
with add ocd overwhelm
depression problems with binge eating and inositol is intimately involved with
certain communication pathways involving neurotransmitters
and hormones it acts as a natural antidepressant
and it also has anti-anxiety effects its effects
are similar to metformin if you're familiar with metformin
that is a drug that they use for diabetes type 2 and it makes
the receptor for insulin more receptive to insulin so it helps to
regulate blood sugars and they also use metformin
for pcos because pcos is a situation where you have insulin
resistance high insulin and then that actually converts to high
androgens so because metformin helps lower insulin
it's good for pcos but guess what and acetol
can also do that and has a lot less side effects
any effect that you would see with lowering insulin
you're going to see a similar effect in when you take inositol so it's going to
help with a lot of different things a lot of women take it for pcos
and i would do large doses as well now the type of inositol you would want
to take is called myo-inositol all right number three it can help
restore these two hormone ratios follicle
stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone those are two
hormones that are made by your pituitary that sends signals down to the ovaries
and also if you're a guy it sends signals to the testicle
to help produce testosterone estrogen and progesterone
and so inositol helps restore these two ratios
so let's say for example you had a problem with your menstrual cycle
inositol can help you let's say you're trying to get pregnant and you want to
increase your fertility inositol can help let's say for example
you did fasting or the ketogenic diet and then
you had a problem with your menstrual cycle
whether it got too heavy or it went away you would want to take anastole
number four and i've already mentioned this inositol can help
reduce the need for binge eating because it's involved with helping your
body make neurotransmitters and certain hormones
specifically serotonin serotonin helps you with depression anxiety
cravings and it's like a hormone that helps
make you calm kind of like an anti-stress hormone
and that leads to number five reduces stress so it can increase your stress
tolerance and help you with mood swings
other than that it doesn't really do anything else

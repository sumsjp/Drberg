so in a few of my videos I talk about the relationship between potassium and
blood pressure but I had someone recently asked why does potassium help
lower blood pressure and that's what this video is about just some quick
background information only 2% of the population and I'm talking about
Americans get enough potassium 2% that means
98% of Americans are deficient they're just not getting enough most of them
don't know that they need a lot they need about 4700 milligrams a day to
achieve the RDAs for potassium and I'm not talking about bananas because
bananas only have about 300 milligrams so you'd have to consume a lot of of bananas
to achieve this and then the problem with that is all the sugar that comes
along with it but mostly you're going to get your potassium from leafy greens
certain vegetables the problem with that is an average American only consumes one
and a half cups of veggies per day when they actually need about 7 to 10 cups
but realize when I'm talking about 7 to 10 cups I'm talking about like loose
lettuce I'm not talking about concentrated like broccoli for example
or cauliflower this would be for leafy greens so if you're gonna do something
more dense maybe you do four cups something like that and also if you chop
this up and cut this down this is gonna come down a lot less because you're
actually making it more dense but the point is that the more vegetables that
you eat the closer you're gonna get to this amount you can also get potassium
from fish and some meats and nuts and it definitely avocados that's a really good
source most people just don't get enough potassium from their diet also when you
consume refined carbohydrates both in grain carbohydrates and sugars you'll
deplete your potassium even more when you're under stress you deplete your
potassium when you take a diuretic you deplete your potassium there's many
different ways that people end up being deficient in potassium if we take a look
at sodium the opposing mineral 90 percent of Americans
are consuming too much of sodium so we're really heavy on the
sodium very light on the potassium and what this creates is a situation where
your blood pressure is going to start going higher and higher and higher
potassium in general has a diuretic effect it's going to get rid of fluid
potassium causes the smooth muscle in your arteries to dilate it's a
vasodilator thus lowering the blood pressure also potassium keeps the
vascular system from being stiff because if your arteries are stiff that alone
can cause hypertension either increase the foods that are high in potassium
which I'll put some links down below on that or take potassium as a supplement
or an electrolyte powder and you're gonna find that your blood pressure is
gonna start coming down now the other cause of hypertension is low vitamin d3
so if you take vitamin d3 and potassium or get it from the food you will find
that your blood pressure should be coming down the other thing I'm going to
mention about potassium is it also lowers the risk of getting a stroke and
the way that that occurs is that potassium directly affects the
consistency of blood it reduces clotting as in blood clots potassium can kill two
birds with one stone of course that's not the best analogy but it can actually
help reduce hypertension and decrease the risk for a stroke

so i have a question what would be healthier or more keto friendly coconut flour or almond flour
i think this is going to surprise you because if we compare both of them and we're going to compare
one cup of each it's actually quite interesting let me just kind of go through it so when we talk
about calories with coconut flour we have about 551 calories versus 648 calories for almond flour
so basically 100 more calories why would that be because of the fats
see coconut flour 1 cup only has 21.8 grams of fat yet almond flour has 56 grams of fat so that's
actually good if you're on the ketogenic diet now check this out carbs 65.3 grams with coconut flour
almond flour only 24 grams okay that's significant there's a little more fiber in almond flour
because coconut flour has 11 grams and almond has 14. so that brings the net carbs even down
even further so and this is the most significant factor coconut flour has 54.3 grams of net carbs
i mean that's huge that's just one cup whereas almond flour only has 10 grams
so that's less than like 1/4 the carbs significant this is also significant out of those carbs we
have 19 grams of those carbs being sugar for coconut flour and only 5 grams for almond flour
significant so protein for coconut flour is 32.2 grams and the protein for almond flour is 24 grams
so there's less protein there's more fat there's a lot less carbs now with coconut flour there's only
trace amounts of nutrients okay but almond flour has a good amount of vitamin e magnesium
calcium copper manganese now with coconut flour we do have more mcts but
and that's going to help you generate more ketones but it's so much higher in carbohydrates
that's going to block your own body's ability to generate ketones to a certain amount
now as far as taste goes coconut flour is pretty bland it's pretty generic the texture is pretty
crumbly and dry because it pulls a lot of moisture but it is easier to consume more almond flour
products especially if these these little keto bombs which i definitely consume quite a few all
right coconut flour is less expensive but almond flour i mean it's not that much more expensive
now as far as the last point oxalates there is more oxalates in almond flour than coconut flour
so if you're susceptible to kidney stones you don't want to overdo it all right there you
have it i think if we compare these two almond flour is the winner hey before you go real quick

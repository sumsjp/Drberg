i think most people know of the main
benefits of potassium supporting a
healthy heart
supporting healthy blood sugars help
bouncing on your fluids things like that
but there's some unexpected
very interesting benefits of potassium i
think you should know about well out of
all the minerals potassium is needed in
the largest quantity you need 4 700
milligrams of potassium every single day
you don't even require a fraction of
that quantity for other nutrients
so with potassium it's unique in that
you need a lot of it primarily because
it supports
two major areas the muscles and the
nerves
you have these little tiny pumps they're
called sodium potassium pumps you have
billions of them in the muscles in the
nervous system and allows the muscles
the nerves to work it also is necessary
in producing energy so
let me go through a couple really
important points about potassium the
first being why are we deficient because
an average person especially in the u.s
only consumes about a cup and a half of
vegetables per day and vegetables are
probably one of the better sources of
potassium and so a cup and a half of
vegetables is just not going to be
even close to what you need you're going
to need between 7 to 10 cups to get
closer to that 4 700 milligrams and
include other foods that have potassium
as well now if you look up what foods
are high in potassium
they will tell you it's fruits
vegetables whole grains
beans things like that now if you look
at a half of a cup of whole grains okay
you're going to get less than about 200
milligrams of potassium and on top of
that
whole grains has phytic acid which
blocks
minerals especially potassium
especially phosphorus
zinc
copper
magnesium
manganese so whole grains are not a good
source of potassium or minerals now you
say what about refined grains well when
you're fine grains you leach out and
lose minerals not to mention all that
refined flour that turns into glucose
which then requires potassium
to help in its storage of glucose in
other words the more refined grains or
sugar that you consume
the less potassium you're going to have
that's going to be available because
it's going to be locked up in the
storage of that stored sugar as glycogen
leaving you with the potassium
deficiency now just as a side note for
those of you that are on the ketogenic
diet
when you do keto and you switch your
fuel from burning sugar okay
to burning fat you're going to be using
up this stored sugar this stored
glycogen and that is going to release a
lot of
fluid in your tissues and with that loss
of fluid comes a loss of electrolytes
including potassium so when you start on
a ketogenic diet
and you don't
substitute that potassium you may end up
with keto fatigue now what about getting
your potassium from fruit well fruit
does have some potassium like one apple
would give you about just under 200
milligrams of potassium but again we
need 4 700 so how many apples would you
have to consume and then also what about
all that sugar that comes with fruit so
fruit also is not the best source of
potassium because it comes with
a lot of sugar now what about fish or or
beef well fish will actually give you
potassium
like a half a fillet will give you up to
600 milligrams of potassium three ounces
of beef will give you 270 milligrams of
potassium so all these other foods will
contribute to
adding up to the requirements you need
for potassium now a potato
okay one medium-sized potato will give
you 800 milligrams of potassium but it
will also give you a lot of starch and
so we don't want to consume potatoes the
best source of potassium
is leafy greens avocados
and certain greens will give you more
potassium than others
like swiss chard
beet tops and the other cool thing about
eating enough greens is that it will
also give you magnesium and one
interesting thing about potassium is you
could be deficient in potassium if
you're low in magnesium so both of those
minerals are needed
together we can become deficient with
potassium through diet which is a very
common reason
but also the more stress you have the
more potassium you will lose the more
sugar you eat the more caffeine you
consume the more alcohol the less
potassium you're going to have in your
body diuretics for example are a common
reason why people are deficient in
potassium if you consume too much salt
you can become deficient in potassium
because sodium potassium work together
so the more salt you consume the more
potassium you need and that also goes
with the more potassium you consume
the more salt you need because they both
function
in their normal ratios but typically we
need at least twice as much potassium as
we do sodium and salt that when you
injure yourself or you go through a
surgery
your body dumps potassium all right so
now let's dive into some of the benefits
that
are unexpected from potassium number one
cognitive benefits remember i talked
about the nerves and the muscles needing
potassium well guess what you have
nerves in your brain so your brain needs
potassium and when you have sufficient
potassium you support cognitive function
memory
focus
concentration
and when you're deficient in potassium
you become a bit disoriented
number two
cerebellum support what is the
cerebellum it's the back part of your
brain that's involved with coordinated
and controlled
movements and so if you're deficient in
potassium you could be a little
uncoordinated
i wonder how many uh children that are
not coordinated are just deficient in
potassium since an average child's diet
probably doesn't get any potassium at
all
they consume a lot of ultra processed
junk food all right number three
mood support potassium supports your
mood potassium can help take you out of
a
flight or fight
mode like a sympathetic nervous system
dominant situation
so potassium is really good for
us people that are in stress potassium
is very important in calming a person
down potassium will help uplift someone
and bring them up potassium will help
make a person less irritable less
worried
less fearful so potassium is really
really important in stress and also
stress depletes potassium all right
number four potassium will make your
muscles stronger this means when you
exercise you'll be less fatigue now to
be totally transparent i do sell a high
potassium electrolyte powder which i
challenge you to do an experiment on
yourself with exercise
because you may notice an improvement in
endurance the times you take that
electrolyte powder versus the times that
you don't but as a side note any time
you take a high potassium
electrolyte powder
and you're exercising also make sure
that you're adding more sea salt with
that because as you sweat you're going
to lose potassium as well as sodium and
you can also experience fatigue from a
loss of sodium just as you could from a
loss of potassium all right number five
potassium can protect you against leg
cramps
a lot of people think that leg cramps
are always a magnesium deficiency but
you can also experience light cramps
from a potassium deficiency too all
right number six potassium counters the
effect from high sodium like i said
before potassium and sodium work
together and so an average person on a
regular diet is going to be much heavier
on the sodium balance than the potassium
and so all these things you hear about
the negative aspects of too much salt in
reality
is just a deficiency of potassium
because potassium protects you against
the side effects of too much salt and
excessive salt is one of the causes
of low potassium and number seven
potassium can help you
have regular bowel movements so it helps
to protect you against constipation why
because like i said before potassium is
involved with muscle and nerve and your
colon is smooth muscle and so if you're
deficient in potassium that smooth
muscle is not going to work as well as
it should and i think the next most
important video for you to watch
would be this one on electrolytes check

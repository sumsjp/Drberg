today we're going to talk about why you can't live without viruses okay very interesting topic what
would happen if all the viruses on this planet right now completely disappeared well guess what
within a short period of time this planet would not survive there are quite a few viruses on
this planet in fact there's a quadrillion quadrillion individual viruses that is 10
nonillion viruses that's 10 to the 31st power if you took a look at how large that number is
if you took all the stars in the galaxy times 100 million you'd get the number of viruses
on this planet so there's quite a few the vast majority and i'm talking about 99.9999
of all viruses are not pathogenic they don't cause disease they're vital to our ecosystem
in the oceans on the lands in the rain forest they're pretty much everywhere and another name
for viruses are called phages certain viruses or phages infect bacteria they prevent the bacterial
population from exploding if there weren't viruses you would have massive amounts of bacteria
that would create a whole other series of problems without viruses you wouldn't get the biodiversity
of microbial life viruses help to ensure oxygen producing phytoplankton get nutrients so 50
of all the oxygen on this planet comes from phytoplankton from the oceans so without viruses
we wouldn't have oxygen and also viruses help build our acquired immunity we have the innate
immunity and then we also have the acquired which actually is created through a learning experience
of being exposed and dealing with viruses and also did you know that our own dna has over a hundred
thousand pieces of viral dna so viruses have intermingled with our own dna for a very very
long time viruses are a part of our microbiome so the whole purpose of a virus is to survive it
doesn't necessarily want to kill the host right away it wants to survive it wants to figure
out the strategies of our body trying to kill it and adapt to survival mechanisms itself
so viruses are constantly evolving adapting and becoming less deadly over time let's take the h1n1
influenza virus i think it's actually influenza a that existed in 1918 as the spanish flu now that
killed 50 million people worldwide but that virus is still around to some degree nowadays but it's
not nearly as deadly as it was back then because viruses over time become less deadly and so
viruses have a good side and they have a bad side but the solution the best solution for viruses
is to keep your own immune system extremely strong and if you're new to my channel i've done a lot of
videos on this vitamin d is very very important zinc is vital vitamin c is also very important
i put a link down below to help you understand how to create a healthy immune system and what
you can do right now thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

today we're going to talk about why avocados can actually help you lose weight
there's some pretty fascinating research from canada in the area of studying a very specific
fat molecule that's unique to avocados called avocatin b which incidentally also has anti-cancer
properties now this is a fairly new molecule that was discovered roughly about two years ago and the
study showed that mice lost weight as well as significantly improved their diabetes type two
so if you have a pet mouse definitely put them on avocados but this study also involved humans and
they found that humans lost weight when they were given this fat molecule that came from avocados
but the question is why why does this fat molecule avocatin be help people lose
weight well because it's involved in the complete fatty acid oxidation now what does that have to do
with anything well when fat is fully oxidized it can improve glucose tolerance and enhance
insulin sensitivity which directly gives you less insulin resistance boy everything tends to circle
back to this insulin resistance thing doesn't it now i'm going to tell you right now avocados
probably are not going to help you lose weight unless you are doing a lot of other things as well
but i think the important lesson to learn from this study is that it's connected to insulin
resistance and insulin resistance is at the core of weight problems and so anything you can do to
improve insulin resistance is going to help you lose weight so i think it's important if you
don't already know this to identify and be aware of all those factors that will help you lessen
this insulin resistance situation so i'm going to go through them number one decreasing stress
number two fiber okay from low carb vegetables they feed the microbes and the microbes make
these little small chain fatty acids that help regulate glucose and make insulin more sensitive
now apple cider vinegar specifically acetic acid can also improve insulin sensitivity also taking
cinnamon can help vitamin d is very important potassium magnesium and b1 can all improve
insulin sensitivity green tea chromium exercise sleeping more a low carb diet
fasting as well as intermittent fasting all will lessen insulin resistance so when you
handle the resistance to insulin you make insulin work better and that's improving
insulin sensitivity all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video so if you're

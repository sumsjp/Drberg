hi guys I want to discuss another topic thats related to the concern about adding more fat to
your diet to lose weight so here you are going to start a ketogenic diet and someone's telling you
you need to add more fat right has more calories and you have a concern about that because it's
like wait a second if I add more fat that's going to cause more weight gain right I mean that sounds
logical well in high school I was very very skinny so I wanted to gain weight so I started
eating more fat started losing weight I thought it's going to help me gain weight but we've been
brainwashed into thinking that eating fat will just make us fat so anyway um years and years and
years of going on low-fat diets have thoroughly proved that people do not lose weight on low-fat
diets and here's why okay what controls whether you burn fat or not our hormones and the hormone
that prevents you from losing weight is insulin insulin and the presence of a little insulin you
will not be able to burn fat okay so what triggers insulin is carbohydrates sugars eating in general
and excessive protein okay so look at this we got what do we have we got carbs proteins and fats
right so if you're going to do a diet on low-fat carbs and protein you're going to you're going to
try your insulin there's no other way around it so fat is neutral is regards in regard to stimulating
insulin that's the only food that is neutral it won't trigger it but then again it won't trigger
any fat burning hormones either eating fat will not cause you to like melt off fat that's not how
it's going to work that's not possible fat does provide a lot of nutrition like fat-soluble vitamins
vitamin A vitamin D which is necessary to get your body healthy but fat in itself is not triggering
the fat burning hormones fat is there as a neutral food to consume to allow you to go longer without
eating it's very satisfying because if you were to do a low-fat protein carbohydrate meal reason low
fat protein you're going to be so hungry you're not going to last and it will force you to eat more
every time you eat you trigger insulin okay so the point is that we need fat not crazy amounts
that we need some to be able to do this eating plan so if you're still confused and you want to
clarify all the details I put a link on a little booklet that I put together it's real simple you
can get read this in an hour and it goat walks through step by step of what I'm talking about
but you don't have to worry about fat especially if you do this correctly it's the only food that
is neutral as far as insulin and the whole goal is to reduce insulin I know it's a new concept
but definitely investigate it learn about it and you'll be glad that you did okay I put the
link down there to check out more information about the book thank you so much for watching

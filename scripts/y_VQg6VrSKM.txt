so this is very interesting it's taken the government
40 years for the ban on dietary fat to be lifted
so check this out in 2015 the advisory committee for the u.s
dietary guidelines finally lifted the ban on total dietary
fat they removed the upper limit of fat so you can now consume as much fat
as you want there's no restriction on consumption of
fat and there's no longer any association
between lowering your dietary fat to reduce your
cholesterol to help you lose weight
to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
now this relatively new shift well it's not really new because it was five years
ago is mind-blowing that it took them 40
years to finally come out and tell people
that okay you know it's okay to consume fat
now you think after five years of having these new guidelines that
it would be broadly promoted and even in the grocery stores you'll still see
tons of food being low fat when in fact the us dietary guidelines which has been
our guiding force of what to eat for the last 40
years it's actually this change is right in their documents it's right on
their website but apparently it's no one's reading it
in fact when you look on the back of any label in the grocery store it'll say
nutrient facts and it lists the total fats the fiber or the carbohydrates the
protein when they actually have the total fats
they still have this little thing on they're saying percent of dv
and they're still operating off this outdated concept that
you want to keep your dietary fats at 30 percent of the total
calories the the saturated fats so this has been going on for a decade they
need to update that and basically remove total fats right
off the label why because there's no evidence that
shows that it creates any problem when you do keto on a high fat diet you
absolutely positively do not have to worry about
these fats harming your heart or raising your
cholesterol what people should emphasize and
definitely on the back the labels is the refined carbohydrates the amount
of refined sugars that are in that food that is the driver of heart disease
obesity and chronic inflammation in summary i
just wanted to tell you that you don't have to worry about total
fats because even the us dietary guidelines is
telling us there's no restriction on the consumption of fat
there's no upper limit thanks for watching

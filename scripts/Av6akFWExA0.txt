so lard versus vegetable oils which one is truly healthier but before i get into this i
want to define what lard is versus tallow lard is pig fat talo is beef or lamb fat
now of course when i'm talking about this i'm talking about organic animals pastured animals
and or grass-fed animals i'm not talking about you know commercial farm animals before i get
into this i want to just define one word it's a french word idea fixate this is a french word
which means fixed idea if you look it up it's an idea that's firmly resistant to any attempts
to modify it so when a person has a fixed idea they're very unlikely to change their mind about
it and they're very unwilling to actually look at the evidence or the information and what
i'm talking about is this very fixed idea that saturated fat especially lard equals
clogged arteries right i mean everyone knows this right well before 1918 before crisco was
invented everyone was cooking with lard or tallow they put in their baking goods they fried with
it they used it everywhere it wasn't considered a bad food when they found a way of modifying
canola oil hydrogenating it altering it making it more stable deodorizing it and then coming up with
this product called crisco that was in 1918. now the company that put out crisco put out a cookbook
and they started an amazing effective marketing campaign that lasted for a very long time
in fact crisco and trans fats were considered healthier than saturated fats like lard and taylor
so it was considered a healthy substitute until the year 2015 when the fda banned trans foods
and so they gave industry about three years to take them off the market if we take 2015
and subtract the year 1918. we get 97 years i mean this blows my mind you have something on
the market for 97 years almost 100 years that was considered safe and healthy but in reality
completely false data it was very unhealthy it causes diabetes type 2 alzheimer's cancer heart
disease but it was considered safe but now it's being banned this is actually mind-blowing and it
tells you the power of marketing and so now we have this entire generation that has this idea
that is false but they consider it true and and for a person now to go back to saturated fats it's
very very difficult because we've been literally brainwashed into thinking it's a healthier thing
let's just take a look at the difference between saturated fats and unsaturated fats
saturated fats you have lard tallow butter coconut oil right then you have unsaturated fats like corn
oil soy oil canola cottonseed oil there's more but i want to just focus on the the big ones if
you actually take a look at some pretty hardcore data that is very credible which i'm going to put
a link down below these unsaturated fats are very unstable especially when you heat them up they
produce massive amounts of oxidation free radical damage inflammation they tear the inside of the
arteries apart create insulin resistance now let's take a look at saturated fats they're very stable
much much less oxidation very little free radical damage are meant to be used with higher amounts of
heat so in summary lard and tallos is way healthier than vegetable oils which are really green oils

so today we're gonna talk about the 10 most popular things that Americans eat
on a regular basis first one is soda drinks okay an average American consumes
forty four point seven gallons of this liquid carbonated syrupy sugar every
single year that is three hundred and seventy four pounds so you're not just
dealing sugar you're dealing with phosphoric acid you're dealing with
caffeine all sorts of chemicals next one bread an average American consumes 53
pounds of bread per year so bread contains not only the refined
carbohydrates that raise insulin but bread also contains gluten and gluten
can really tear up your intestine and create all sorts of digestive problems
not to mention cognitive issues as well there's a lot of other things in bread
there's dough softeners there's hidden sodium msg and of course when you
combine bread with protein as in meat as in the sandwich and you eat that
together you get a bit of what's called glycation glycation is a term to
describe combining a carbohydrate with a protein or a carbohydrate and fat
and you heat it up now when you're eating the food you're actually raising
the temperature and that can develop a glycated process whereby your blood
becomes very very sticky I mean if you think about like a diabetic okay they
have high blood sugar the high blood sugar combines with the protein in the
blood hemoglobin so that protein and sugar combine so if the sugars too high
it gets stuck in the protein and that is a test called
a1c which is an average of your blood sugars for three months and they have a
whole rating scale that you can evaluate if your Sugar's are okay or not the
numbers go up if you have high sugar and they'll come down if you have low sugar
but this is basically measuring the glycation burgers there are over 50
billion burgers sold every single year that means a lot of people are consuming
burgers now I consume burgers without the bun of course but when you combine
the bread with the meat you get this thing as well and of course not many
people eat a burger without ketchup right or they might have fries with that
or they might have a coke with that right here so if we combine this this
this and this we get a lot of this right here
and we also get an exaggeration of a spike of insulin and too much insulin
will cause visceral fat which is not very healthy because it's gonna go
inside the liver it's going to go around the organs and create a lot of different
problems for you all right next one is french fries an average person consumes
forty nine point two pounds of potato products every single year and now that
this number an average American consumes 29 pounds of actual fries so they also
consume chips potatoes and other forms of potato
there are over 1.5 billion pounds of chips sold in America every single year
so Americans love potato products of course the question is what are you
frying this in corn oil soy oil which is GMO and you have this carbon this fat
under high heats you actually start spiking something called acrylamide
which is carcinogenic this chemical is created when you combine sugar and amino
acids and high temperature alright next one is this thing called ice cream right
so here you have a lot of carbon sugar and you have the protein and you have
the fat and it's heated so you're definitely gonna get a lot of glycation
okay but you're gonna get a lot of sugar and I personally used to consume a lot
of ice cream in fact I use ice cream to help me sleep
that night it worked for a while and then it didn't work anymore and what
happened was it created a blood sugar spike which basically makes you very
very tired or unconscious you go right out but about two o'clock in the morning
the blood sugars go down because the insulin spikes and it's pushing the
blood sugars down and then I started waking up exactly at 2:00
every morning with very severe restless leg syndrome
which basically is a lot of lactic acid and my muscles which actually comes from
eating glucose because glucose can turn into lactic acid the muscles and it was
it was miserable of course I would wake up with these serious bags underneath my eyes
I had zero awareness on nutrition at that point and this was actually two
years ago I'm just kidding that was like in my late 20s but the average American
consumes 23 pounds of ice cream every single year and about 1.4 billion
gallons of ice cream are sold every single year that's a lot of ice cream
all right number six hot dogs 20 billion hot dogs are sold every single year that
means a lot of people are eating a lot of hot dogs and of course I'm not
talking about the grass-fed organic hot dogs I'm talking about the processed
nitrates with msg and all sorts of additional parts of the cow or pig put
into this I mean if you actually look at the ingredients of a hotdog they
actually put dextrose in there don't ask me why I think they use it as a filler
but I'm don't quote me on that and then we get to number seven pizza an average
person consumes 40 pizzas a year over 38 billion dollars is spent on pizza alone
okay number eight Oreo cookies they're over 2.5 billion packs of Oreo cookies
sold every single year in fact if you look at the ingredients in an Oreo
cookie it's just different forms of sugar and then the last ingredient is
like chocolate it's not the last part which means there's not as much
chocolate as you might think but there sure is a lot of sugar alright number 9
chicken nuggets and chicken strips well there are over 2.3 billion servings of
chicken nuggets every single year and 1.5 billion servings of the chicken
strips sold every single year now of course we have the breading and we have
the protein and it's heated so again we're getting glycation we're getting a
spike in insulin and we're also deep-frying in in this GMO soy
or corn oil which is very inflammatory and lastly number 10 Donuts 25,000 donut
shops in United States alone Americans buy ten billion Donuts every single year
that's a lot of donuts okay we have a combination of the soy or corn oil
glycation because it's deep-fried acrylamide and a spike of insulin so now
it's very obvious to see why Americans have insulin resistance and they're
overweight and they have all sorts of symptoms related to high levels of
insulin a fatty liver obesity heart disease increased risk of stroke inflammatory
conditions sleep apnea and the list goes on and on and on if you haven't seen my
video on the toxicity of sugar you might want to check it out it's right here
boom

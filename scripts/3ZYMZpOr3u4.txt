had a question from someone that wanted to know is psoriasis contagious well it's a big fat no
it's not contagious psoriasis is an autoimmune disease it's an immune problem and there's
red scaly plaques on the skin and what's happening is there's certain parts of the skin
that is replacing itself too fast within three days when it should be replacing itself within
like 28 days so there's a a lot of problems on the skin and it could be some itchiness involved
now to figure out what psoriasis is we need clues so here are some of the triggers
taking antibiotics can trigger this condition
stress can trigger it having an infection especially strep or candida omega-6 fatty acids
which are certain unsaturated fatty acids that are inflammatory create inflammation of the gut
statins which is interesting what do statins do they block cholesterol so we'll come back to that
and in the winter there's a worsening of psoriasis i wonder why that is well if we
take a look at some other clues steroids do help and it's part of a treatment that a lot of doctors
recommend for psoriasis problem is there's side effects right vitamin d creams do help and so does
uv light okay what does uv like do well first of all it's a therapy directly in the skin but also
certain uv frequencies can increase vitamin d in the body if you do a deep dive with psoriasis
they've isolated part of your immune system being a problem there's an excessive amount of the t
helper cell 17 going on so it's an overactive t helper 17 cell which is producing too much of
this pro-inflammatory cytokine so basically we have this over active immune cell that's
creating this inflammation and when this cell is too high it can trigger an autoimmune condition
where your body starts to attack itself and so i did a real huge search on what could suppress
this cell what could suppress this cytokine and guess what came up vitamin d
now what does vitamin d have to do with that it helps modulate or calm and control
an overactive immune system so vitamin d is very very important in helping to minimize these side
effects from autoimmune conditions you'd have to take a bit more than usual like 30 to 40 000 units
per day now the next recommendation is bile salts bile salts can increase the vitamin d receptors
so if there's some type of problem where you can't absorb vitamin d bile salts can actually
help you absorb it now tutca is a very specific type of bile salt because there's several this
is another recommendation in addition to regular bile salts i would take both of those and i would
take them on an empty stomach i would take in the morning take one and then in the afternoon take
maybe another one and maybe take one with meals taking probiotics have been shown to decrease
the symptoms of psoriasis as well simply because the dysfunction originates in your gut usually
from an antibiotic or infection or something you're consuming that might have triggered it
and then another recommendation be cod liver oil cod liver oil is very high in vitamin d vitamin a and
omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory that counters the omega-6 fatty acids
and because there's a gut problem which means there's a permeability problem it could be a leaky
gut you may want to try carnivore for a while just because that might decrease the inflammation
in your gut now a couple last things i want to mention of course it's worse in the winter because
there's not a lot of sun so there's going to be less vitamin d people with psoriasis need
to be taking a very good amount of vitamin d of course also take vitamin k2 with it now what's the
relationship between statins and vitamin d well take a while guess what vitamin d is made from
cholesterol in your skin so the uv light hits the skin it turns the cholesterol into a pre-vitamin d
which is then converted into an active form of vitamin d through the kidney
and the liver so taking statins can decrease your overall vitamin d levels all right there you have
it and if you want additional information on psoriasis i did another video on it
you can check it out i put it down below before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a
debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is
just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

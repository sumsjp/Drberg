so how do you get rid of a hiccup well first of all what is a hiccup a hiccup is a problem with
your diaphragm the diaphragm is a muscle that helps you breathe so it contracts and relaxes
so what happens with a hiccup is you're getting an intermittent contraction and it's involuntary
so you're not controlling it there are certain sensors that are in that diaphragm there's oxygen
receptors there's receptors for carbon dioxide and there's all sorts of neurological receptors too so
if you're altering the amount of oxygen or co2 or the nerves it can cause a short circuiting
and that can lead to a hiccup and it can be triggered by excitement
fear like you're really scared laughter eating too fast and i'm sure there's many other things
so the question is what can you do well number one hiccup on purpose now what does that mean
think about it normally a hiccup is involuntary so if you voluntarily try to hiccup you're going to
find very quickly that you're not going to have hiccups anymore so what's happening is you're
putting the diaphragm under your control again so it's no longer involuntary i mean this technique
also sometimes can work for resting tremors which is involuntary as well so if you could try to make
your uh hand go back and forth on purpose sometimes that can actually get rid of the
the the tremor this also works for if you stutter okay if you try to stutter on purpose it tends to
get rid of the stuttering so you can apply this to the hiccups as well you can actually start
to slow down your breath and just calm things down so you want to breathe in like four seconds slowly
and you breathe in and then breathe out four seconds and go back and forth because what's
happening is the autonomic nervous system is now functioning so you are again causing your
autonomic nervous system to do certain things and this can help reset things so to speak number
three and you probably already know this you can drink a glass of water from the opposite side
so that can help as well and the last thing is you just want to calm down because it's very rare
that people get hiccups when they're calm and when they're relaxed so go ahead and try this
and let me know if it works hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you

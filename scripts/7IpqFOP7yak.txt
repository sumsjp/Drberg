all right so today we're going to talk about the health benefits
of alcohol now i know this is not going to be popular and in fact some of you might unsubscribe
but realize i'm just the health messenger i'm trying to give you more awareness on what to
do to increase health and if you happen to drink alcohol there are some things to reduce the that
effects but are you ready for the health benefits it's a big fat zero there are no health benefits
of drinking alcohol it turns out that any amount of alcohol can be damaging to your brain and your
heart despite what has been promoted the last 40 years saying that alcohol will benefit your
heart if you have a moderate amount one drink for women per day and two drinks for men per day did
you realize that there's even this concept that's floating around that states that abstinence of
alcohol is a cause of heart disease well in a new study university of oxford 25 000 people from 2014
to 2020 they found that even small amounts this is below moderate amounts can have a negative effect
on your brain in your heart now what about all these antioxidants in the in the wines you know
it's from grapes grapes are healthy well there are antioxidants for sure but it's the alcohol that is
the problem now in your liver you have something called alcohol dehydrogenase it's an enzyme
that converts the alcohol into something called acetaldehyde which is very very toxic to your body
and your liver in fact it's a very highly toxic byproduct and it causes major oxidation
on the liver and other organs especially your heart and there's a lot of free radical damage
occurs when you have too much acetaldehyde now the only purpose of this video is not to tell
you can't drink it's just to give you the truth about alcohol because some people are going out
of their way in drinking more alcohol because they think it's going to give you a health benefit well
that's just purely false information but i do want to give you some things that you can do
not only as a substitute to alcohol but to reduce
the damage so if you're going to drink a small amount there are things you can do to
counter the damage the first thing i'm going to recommend if you haven't tried this before
it's called kombucha tea kombucha tea is a fermented drink it has a very tiny bit of alcohol
it creates a nice relaxation effect the texture of kombucha tea is very similar to
beer or champagne it's very fizzy it's very thick and it creates a nice relaxation effect so you may
want to try that instead of alcohol to see if you'd like that there's also something called
kutza root extract and this can be taken as a supplement to help you reduce cravings for alcohol
and if you take it with l-glutamine it seems to work pretty good okay so you might want to try
that and the last thing i'm going to recommend for damage control if you're going to drink is
just to take some milk thistle right before you drink and it's a paddle protective in other words
it protects your liver cells against damage in fact it even protects liver cells against certain
poisons and acetaldehyde is a poison uh from the breakdown of that enzyme i just talked about so
if you were to take some milk thistle before you drink i think that can actually minimize
the damage now again i just want to emphasize i'm not telling you not to ever drink alcohol
i'm just i'm just telling you if you think you're getting health benefits you're not and i'm also
telling you there are things you can do to limit the damage that alcohol crates on your body and
i didn't mention this but i think fasting is another really important thing to do so let's
say for on a weekend lets you drink and you were to fast the next day that would be probably the
best thing you can do to help you increase your antioxidant network and help you repair some
of the damage that was created on your liver hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

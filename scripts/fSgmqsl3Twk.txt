now when you're evaluating grain fat
versus grass-fed beef there's not a lot
of information
or credible studies out there that look
at
the differences between these two things
especially
grass-fed grass finished
to grain finish
beef and so you'll have people that will
tell you there's no difference
um they're both the same so go ahead and
get whatever's cheaper but that advice
is purely based on there's no studies
that show the difference until now
there's a fascinating research project
in place right now that is not 100 done
but there's definitely enough data to
conclude that there's a major difference
between these
two sets of variables so that's what i
want to talk about today this research
project was coordinated and set up by a
non-profit organization called
bionutrient institute which i now became
a member i'll put their information down
below it's a it's a great uh
organization
that is
trying to figure out how do you define
nutrient-dense foods okay and not just
plant-based vegetables but also beef so
this is a territory that there's not a
tremendous amount of information in fact
if you just take any vegetable like a
tomato and you look it up online
what are the nutritional facts okay
it'll give you the calories the total
fat the carbohydrates
maybe some nutrients
but my question is when was that data
accumulated what type of soils did they
actually grow that tomato in and
was it organic was it conventional there
are so many variables so the problem
that this organization is trying to
solve
is to do the research and the homework
necessary to get a wide variety of
samples from many different farms they
have 250 different farms that are
participating and they send in their
samples and then all this data is
correlated with the soils that it's
grown on and the type of vegetable
they're using so that there's a really
good transparency to look at
the source of where this tomato comes
from and the nutrients that are in it
not just vitamins and minerals but
phytonutrients as well and one of the
big projects they started last year was
the beef project and
there's some fascinating data i talked
with the scientist that's involved with
that and i learned some
very interesting information i want to
share with you today but i do want to
say
they're working in a
handheld
affordable
scanner that uses an ultraviolet light
to pick up information
from
vegetables and then eventually when the
research is done it can also be used
on beef by scanning
beef and giving you feedback to evaluate
all sorts of biomarkers to tell you what
is
good bad or okay and the handheld
scanner that they're using for
vegetables right now just about done i
think everything's going to be done at
the end of the year so it's a really
exciting research project that aligns
with what i'm into is promoting
nutrient-dense foods but first you have
to do the research to determine what
nutrient density is
and then that takes a lot of time and
money but that gives you a little
background of what this video is about
so today we're going to talk about the
findings from the this one steady on
beef comparing grass-fed grass finished
beef okay versus grain finished beef
okay the difference between the two now
the only reason
someone would grain finish
an animal is because of the cost you
make more money it's going to be fattier
it's probably going to taste a little
bit different and you can sell it for a
larger profit so when i talked to the
scientists yesterday something really
jumped out and i want to just talk about
that first when they evaluated this
muscle from a grass-finished
cow
the mussel meat mimicked
a healthy athlete compared with the
grain finished muscle it mimicked
metabolic syndrome okay so the
biomarkers with the grain finished beef
had
more inflammatory markers higher uric
acid levels
higher homocysteine levels which in
humans that relates to cardiovascular
problems they had also higher
advanced glycated end products which are
a negative biomarker that relates to
proteins that have been connected and
bound to
sugars which kind of clog up the system
and that can occur
all over the body and you see this in
diabetes you see this in alzheimer's you
see this in all chronic inflammatory
conditions and in the grass fed grass
finished beef there is much higher omega
3 fatty acids okay those are the
anti-inflammatory fats
that help the cardiovascular system in
the brain there is a three times higher
dha and a 10 times higher epa those are
both omega-3 fatty acids also there was
much higher phytonutrients okay now
you're saying phytonutrients in animal
products yes because grass-fed
grass-finished cows eat grass and grass
has phytonutrients
so there are higher carotenoids like
beta-carotene and many others there is
much higher microbial diversity which
gives you a whole different set of short
chain fatty acids and secondary
compounds that are beneficial to blood
sugars and all sorts of things now this
next point i found very interesting
there was higher amounts of niacinamide
which is a form of vitamin b3 in the
grain finished
beef compared to the grass fed now
that's kind of weird because why would
you have higher amounts of any vitamin
in a grain finished beef well these
cattle are fed grains that are enriched
with
vitamins especially b vitamins and one
of the vitamins that they enrich these
grains with which are the feed which is
niacinamide because in the grass-fed
grass finish
group there was much higher niacin which
is a different form of b3 in the
grass-fed grass finish group there was
higher vitamin c levels there were
higher vitamin e levels there's three
times as much vitamin e compared to the
grain group there were anti-tumor
biomarkers that were much higher like
five times higher than in the grain
group
another nutrient that was higher is
called choline and choline is very
beneficial for making sure that your
liver does not get fatty and that's one
thing i forgot to ask the scientists was
there any difference in liver
fat okay because
when you fatten cattle that last one to
three months of their life
you're just fattening up not just the
muscle the liver is probably being
fattened as well there is higher
carnosine which is a compound that helps
fat burning so hands down
not only were there more nutrients in
the grass-fed grass finish
beef but we have better metabolic
biomarkers which measures the overall
health of that muscle people think about
muscle just as something that helps you
move
but there's a huge metabolic factor in
your muscles that helps you create
energy and evaluating the muscle tissue
as far as the biochemistry and the
pathways you can tell a lot about the
overall health of the animal now after
this study is done obviously they need
to do the next level study which is to
evaluate if you're consuming
a healthier
animal product
does that make your body healthier and
that's the question i want to ask you
and you can put this in the comments
down below would it make a difference to
your health if you consume
sick animals with metabolic syndrome
versus animals that were healthier that
had
tissue of a healthy athlete so tell me
in the comments down below what you
think
but i do know some people are going to
say well i can't afford grass-fed
grass-finished beef to answer that
question i'm just going to reply by
telling you
something is better than nothing the
most important thing is to
keep your carbohydrates low and when
someone starts a ketogenic diet
i always tell them do what you can don't
worry about the quality at first just
keep your carbohydrates low because the
benefits of doing something that is low
carb
is very very huge but then the next
phase you'd want to work up to is the
increasing the quality
of those foods that you eat until you
get to the point where you're doing a
healthy version of the ketogenic diet
because right now there are a lot of
ketogenic foods out there that
are carb friendly but they're definitely
not what i consider the healthy version
of the ketogenic diet now on that note i
think it'd be appropriate for you to
watch the next video
on the healthiest foods
that you can eat
i put that up right here check it out
you

this shocked me actually 67% of calories kids eat come from ultra-processed foods that's two-thirds
of all the calories that they consume that is mind-blowing so what is an ultra processed calorie
well it's the industrial grains all the processed grain products you see in the grocery store
we have the sweet snacks they're ready to eat and they're ready to heat foods foods high in
added sugar foods with trans fats refined starches like modified food starch for example now most of
these foods are very very high in carbohydrates but without very many nutrients so you have the
situation where you have high oxidation that's like rusting out the inside of the body without
any antioxidants that are supposed to protect all this free radical damage so this is where
the heart disease comes in and the artery this is where you can be at risk for getting cancer
and especially diabetes now the problem with diabetes is that
normally you're going to have high insulin which the doctors are never going to check
for probably 20 years or 25 years before the blood sugars even go up so diabetes takes a
long time to develop and when you're developing this condition a lot of times you don't even know
it's brewing in the oven until it's in the later stages now most of these calories are not eaten at
home it's out of the house fast food restaurants that type of thing and the problem is when these
kids eat these foods they're just never satisfied so they keep eating over and over and over
because they're highly addictive now this study involved age group between two and 19 years old
from 1999 to 2018 involving 33 000 participants now in 1999 when they started the study the
ultra process calories encompassed 61 of the calories but in 2018 it's 67 of their calories
so it went up a bit so ultra process would be the soft drinks the chips the chocolate the candy the
ice cream the sweetened breakfast cereals which by the way are the most common things that kids
consume then we have packaged soups chicken nuggets very popular hot dogs fries listen
if your kids are consuming this they need to get on the ketogenic diet there are so many wonderful
desserts and foods that mimic some of these foods they're not identical they're similar
so i would definitely get your kids involved this is a train wreck waiting to happen
when you have two-thirds of our children eating these foods so really it's up to you
and me to spread the word and get these kids on a healthy version of the ketogenic diet i also
put a link down below of some really good desserts that i think that your kids will like that don't
have any sugar in them thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

you know they say that soda is fine in moderation but soda has the potential to actually melt your
bones let's talk about why well what's in soda you have high fructose corn syrup uh there's
also soda with just different types of sugar you have phosphoric acid you have caffeine so let's
start with the highest fructose corn syrup what's that going to do well it's going to deplete your
vitamin d as well as your calcium also it's going to cause more calcium dumping from the kidneys now
you're also going to get a depletion of magnesium putting you more at risk for osteoporosis
magnesium is needed to build bone and it's very necessary in the absorption of vitamin d
now if we have a deficiency in magnesium that's going to affect the parathyroid
and the parathyroid is going to start robbing calcium from the bone so that's another mechanism
then we have this thing called phosphoric acid why do they put this phosphoric acid in this soda
well because there's a tangy flavor to it and it also prevents mold and bacteria from growing
because there's so much sugar in there right because bacteria yeast mold all live on sugar
but the problem is phosphoric acid is an acid and it can increase your risk of getting osteoporosis
and osteopenia which is a kind of a milder version of osteoporosis
phosphoric acid also weakens your teeth and it decreases the absorption
of iron and zinc now if you do caffeine with the soda it leeches calcium from the bone as well so
so each one of these things is a compounding effect but other than some of these minor
complications and these different effects i think it's totally healthy to drink so if

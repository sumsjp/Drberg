recently i realized that i don't have a video comparing vitamin k1 to vitamin k2 so i wanted to
create this video to talk about each one vitamin k1 has everything to do with blood clotting
and bone metabolism if you're deficient in vitamin k1 you may have bruising or if you
cut yourself and you're bleeding and it's taking a very long time to clot or heal up you can be
deficient in vitamin k1 also if you have if you have bleeding gums if you're brushing your teeth
now that could be also vitamin c but it could also be a deficiency of vitamin k1 so vitamin k1
is very very important to your survival because if you didn't have it and you got injured you could
literally bleed to death internally or externally so based on that our bodies have made sure that we
rarely ever run out of vitamin k1 and on top of that there's so many different foods that
we eat that have vitamin k1 it's very unlikely you're going to be deficient especially since
the requirement for k1 are not even milligrams they're in micrograms so we need very small
amounts to satisfy the requirements now where do you get vitamin k1 primarily from plant sources
now vitamin k1 is also in animal foods as well but not in the amounts that you would get from
plants like leafy greens now just to switch over to vitamin k2 this nutrient has everything to
do with calcium control it prevents calcium from accumulating in your vascular system and it also
has everything to do with bone strength so it keeps the calcium in the bone and it keeps the
calcium out of the soft tissues and vitamin k2 is primarily in animal products like animal fat
and it's also in fermented food like natto which is a fermented soybean it's also in sauerkraut
but it's very very high in beef liver for example or pork liver or pork proteins or chicken or beef
egg yolks soft cheeses so right there you can see that our bodies
were meant to consume both plant and animal foods based on nutrients that our body needs
now i realize that vitamin k is fat soluble so the vitamin k1 in plants is very poorly absorbed
in fact you only absorb less than 10 percent of it good thing you don't need very much
but it's very poorly absorbed but as a survival mechanism what we've done to counteract that is we
just recycle the vitamin k1 so if you're not consuming much k1 our body's going to take what
we have and keep recycling it over and over and over now vitamin k2 is much better absorbed why
because it comes with fat and any time you consume a fat-soluble vitamin with
fat you're going to absorb it more it's also going to stimulate bile which is going to help
you absorb that fat cycle vitamin so it's a combination of bile and then the pancreatic
enzyme called lipase that helps you break down the food and absorb these nutrients more effectively
now what most people do including myself when you're doing a salad for example you're going to
be using oil like olive oil to help the absorption you're going to help the absorption of vitamin k1
now one thing you need to know about vitamin k2 is that the bacteria in your colon
can actually make k1 from vitamin k2 so this is another survival mechanism that if you have the
microbes in your gut you'll be able to make more k2 from k1 if you're on a low-fat diet
that's going to be a problem to get this if you have inflammation in your gut anywhere as
diverticulitis or colitis or crohn's any digestive issue you're going to have malabsorption you're
not going to be able to absorb this one or this one as well if you had your gallbladder removed
that could also create a deficiency because you're not going to make enough bile in which case you
just need to take purified bile salts if you have a fatty liver or your liver is damaged you're not
going to be able to make bile to be able to use that to absorb these two fat soluble vitamins
as well if you're on a blood thinner like warfarin that's going to block
k1 and you will have deficiencies of that and as a side note if you are on warfarin
i have a video explaining the types of vegetables you should be consuming which are low
in vitamin k1 if you're interested in doing the diet that i always recommend which is healthy keto
basically you just eliminate the leafy greens and you do other types of vegetables
i put that video right down below alright guys so now you know the difference between vitamin k1
and k2 before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

i want to talk about coffee and the amount of coffee that we should drink 83%
of US adults consume coffee now what's in coffee is caffeine and the way caffeine works is it
blocks a certain chemical that makes you sleepy so basically caffeine wakes you up it helps give
you this sensation of well-being you feel more creative and you're less sleepy but if you have
too much it can have some negative things it can increase cortisol it can also increase
adrenaline if you have too much so another name for cortisol is glucocorticoid because one of the
functions of cortisol is to help you regulate your blood sugars if your blood sugars are too
low but cortisol decreases insulin sensitivity so what that means if you have too much it can
actually take you out of ketosis and the problem with a lot of people doing keto is they do a
massive amount of coffee and especially at the wrong times they do it through the entire day
so cortisol spikes at 8:30 in the morning okay so if you're drinking coffee through the day you're
constantly jacking up cortisol and as you do that you start stressing out the body and it has some
side effects which we'll get to now you're also stimulating adrenaline and that's going to put
you more in the flight or fight mode so how much coffee should you drink well i recommend
you drink eight ounces okay that would be the size of this coffee cup it looks very large right it's
actually very small okay this is how much coffee i drink every single day it's very small eight
ounces that's all i drink that's what i recommend you drink as you drink more coffee it's going to
affect you in various ways it can give you side effects it can actually make you tired
it can actually prevent you from sleeping or getting the quality of sleep that you really
want it can inhibit ketosis and i recommend that you check your ketones by just consuming a small
cup and then the next day check your ketones after drinking say three or four cups and and you'll see
that you'll actually be less in the ketosis also can give you more anxiety if you do too much so
most people drink coffee to have more focus right but the problem is it'll give you less focus
less concentration over time you'll be more add also it can decrease serotonin and serotonin is
the hormone that helps you assist in making you happier so you might kind of be grouchy
during the second part of the day also it can give you tension in the back part of your neck
okay up in the top part right between where your skull connects to your neck and it can
also affect and give you less digestion so do one of these okay you can do decaf make sure
it's organic or teeccino which is the great coffee alternative or some herbal tea that's naturally
decaffeinated hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

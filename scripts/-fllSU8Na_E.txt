hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the parathyroid gland now what are
the parathyroid glands okay there's four of them now if we take a look at the Adam's apple which
is right up here on the top of the trachea right below it is the thyroid so the thyroid is located
about two-and-a-half inches at the bottom of your neck okay the parent thyroid are behind
the thyroid gland okay they're in the back part and they control calcium in fact the name of the
hormone that controls calcium is the parathyroid hormone okay pretty simple right so what does it
do if this is such a tight control for calcium in the blood like it always wants to maintain
a constant stable calcium it will do anything to keep that level there so it'll increase in
decrease based on the level of calcium in the blood it's like a thermostat if you set
it at 72 your your thermostat is constantly turning off and on off and on all day and all
night right same thing with the parathyroid or the calcium in the blood okay so it just
maintains a very tight control because we need calcium for the main for a lot of things one is
the main communication between nerves you need calcium okay so now when this hormone increases
it increases calcium in the blood all right so it's it's raising calcium your blood now where
does it get it from if it gets it from the bone so it'll literally rob the bone of calcium to
keep normal levels of calcium in the blood now it also the parathyroid hormone also activates
vitamin D in other words vitamin D in your body is usually inactive and it has to be converted to the
active form of vitamin D the parathyroid hormone activates the enzyme to do that why because it's
another control of calcium so it will actually increase the conversion based on what's happening
to the calcium levels and then it will increase it by increasing more vitamin D because vitamin
D actually helps you or calcium by 20 times in the intestines raising the calcium in the blood
now what is the problem of too much calcium in the blood is the big problem so sometimes these little
glands can enlarge and turn into tumors okay if that happens this hormone starts increasing more
and more and more and that means you're going to be robbing more calcium from the bone and
that's one of the causes of osteopenia that's a lower thinning of the bones it's a mild version
of osteoporosis and then you get osteoporosis which is a major demineralization of the bone
and then you can get fractures bone pain and another condition called hypercalcemia which
basically means too much calcium in the blood okay the problem with too much calcium in the
blood is that you can get high blood pressure you ever heard of a calcium channel blocker that's the
medication that blocks calcium well why do you think they use that for blood pressure
right atrial fib palpitations kidney stones you get kidney stones for having a tumor on your
parathyroid so if they keep coming back tiredness why because the calcium is not working within the
brain and the nervous system and everything starts slowing down that's why you have memory
loss concentration problems and you can even have GERD that's a digestive issue that means
the valve on the top of stomach is not closing correctly so the parathyroid is very important
in controlling calcium okay you can also have hypo calcium iya or you can have low amounts of
the hormones and there's a whole series of other symptoms that you can get but if you look this up
the the tumor on the parathyroid gland they say well we don't know what causes that okay so we
just remove it okay so it's but it's still the success rate is pretty high even if you remove
it because you have four of them and sometimes they you can go tumors on multiple glands but
what I did is I got out my trusty toxicology book right this is an amazing book that you can
get a lot of information from and I turn to the chapter on the parathyroid okay I wanted to see
if there's any problem we research being done in that area and has tumors of the parathyroid
one is aluminum one is a chemical I can't even pronounce ozone and the influence of xenobiotic
chemicals what's a xenobiotic chemical those are foreign chemicals pesticides herbicides fungicides
so that's really what causes tumors the same tumors that are in other parts of the body are
which are triggered by chemicals also affect this as well so I don't know why they don't
make the connection with these chemicals so this is just another reason why you need to
continue to consume cruciferous and other vegetables simply because thank goodness
Nature has left a remedy for all the chemicals that we are exposed to you see so many people
just ending up with these weird diseases and dreamers on the parathyroid for no reason well
that's the reason because we're constantly exposed to that so anyway I wanted to just
kind of give you the basics on the parathyroid and put your comments below thanks for watching

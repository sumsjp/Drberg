so someone had a question can a person actually increase their metabolism okay
let's talk about that well one of the things that you may have learned in
other videos is that insulin resistance is one factor that can cause you to
plateau with your weight so let's say your trailer's weight and you hit this
setpoint you just cannot get below like your body is real comfortable at a
certain weight that is because of insulin resistance there's just too much
insulin in the body and people that are struggling with weight and that are
overweight have a lot more insulin in their body because insulin resistance
increases the amount of insulin in your body so in order to fix that you have to
lower insulin with keto and intermittent fasting number two exercise now out of
all the parts of exercise you have duration how long you exercise you have
the intensity of the exercise you have the frequency of how often you exercise
you have the recovery of how long you recover after exercise you have all
these variables out of all of them it's the intensity that is the most important
factor than raising your metabolism so then we have exercise okay you have
several variables you have duration how long you exercise the intensity how hard
you exercise and you have recovery how long you don't exercise after exercising
okay out of all three of these variables the intensity is the most important in
stimulating and metabolism okay it also stimulates growth hormone which is the
the main fat burning hormone and other hormones - like adrenaline and also
glucagon okay that's the fat burning hormone the key is doing a full body
workout where you're involving a lot of muscle groups and doing it at a high
intensity level but doing it a shorter duration because we want the duration
short and we want the recovery longer so high intensity short duration long
recovery okay so let's say you're going to workout for 40 minutes you would do
this full body high intensity short workout where your pulse rate is
really spiked and you're gonna rest until your pulse rate comes all the way
down do it again for 40 minutes that would be the ideal scene but of course
work into it and probably use the personal trainer but the this is what
you need to know it's the intensity that will trigger and increase your
metabolism and your mitochondria which is a little energy factories in the cell
number three you probably destroyed your metabolism from doing a low calorie diet
which is really a low nutrient diet so to fix that you need to nourish the body
so consume nutrient-dense foods okay so that's a given you just can't
heal the body with low nutrients it's just impossible number four enhance the
thyroid function so you may need to add sea kelp which has the iodine and other
trace minerals selenium is really really good with Hashimoto's but mainly make
sure your gallbladder 'king and the liver make sure that your insulin is not
too high and also avoid the GMO foods which is really responsible for blocking
the thyroid and even creating autoimmune problems with the thyroid okay now the
other thing on the flip side you have caffeine amphetamines ephedra which
all are stimulants to the metabolism right so people take them and they go on
a diet and then longer hungry and they lose all this weight but the problem it
comes with a package it stimulates adrenaline that stimulation ends up
burning out adrenaline receptors and the adrenal gland itself so you end up with
adrenal fatigue and then you start gaining weight so this is not the way
you want to lose weight this is a quick fix which comes with a package these are
the four things to focus on to restore the metabolism and actually increase
your metabolic rate thanks for watching hey tell me what you think about this

I did a video on the topic of coming off keto and going back on keto and then not
getting results and someone had a question about metabolic flexibility so
I thought I'd do a video on that one topic so what is metabolic flexibility
it's your capacity to adapt to different fuels so you're on low-carb then you can
switch on high carb and your body is able to adapt to it and your metabolism
is fairly good now the first thing I want to mention is there's very few
people that have metabolic flexibility most people have metabolic inflexibility
so they start going from high carb to low-carb and then high carb the low
carbon every time they do that they have a harder and harder time of getting in
ketosis and adapting and also what happens when they go back and forth
because they're having a cheat day or and there they can't seem to be
consistent they actually slow their metabolism over
a period of time the question is how did they become metabolic inflexible in the
first place a history of insulin elevation over time
this little hormone insulin is the gatekeeper it is the main thing that
determines what type of fuel you're gonna burn if the insulin goes up you're
not going to burn fat you're gonna burn sugar if the insulin goes down you will
burn fat but this hormone gets damaged as you stimulate this hormone over time
by consuming a lot of carbs and also by eating frequently and you start
developing insulin resistance and this is the thing that really is behind a
slow metabolism and a stuck setpoint where no matter what you do you can't
seem to get below a certain weight and that comes from yo-yo dieting especially
if you're doing a low calorie high carb low fat diet which so many people have
done that also stress will ruin this system pregnancy puts a lot of stress in
that system and many women who become pregnant
have the baby find that that's the point where the metabolism has slowed down
so this hormone change can really affect this system right here
lack of sleep let's say for example you're working third shift for many many
years that can greatly affect your metabolism overtraining I remember I
worked on a patient who was exercising I'm not kidding six hours a day okay
seven days a week that's overtraining and she wondered why
she couldn't lose weight there's no chance of recovering from that okay then
we have inflammation if you have inflammation in the body that can create
insulin resistance so if you're lucky enough not to have to go through a lot
of these stressors you may have metabolic flexibility and you can pretty
much get away with going back and forth and back and forth but if you're like
most people and you have metabolic inflexibility including myself you're
gonna have to try a different approach you're not going to be able to get away
with the cheat day you're gonna have to be consistent consistently keeping the
insulin normalized through doing healthy keto in a minute fasting exercise
consistently and making sure that your nutrients in the food are at a high
level and it does take some time to really correct this I'm talking about
months possibly even a few years because I don't want to give anyone this idea
that hey in three or four weeks your metabolism is going to be corrected and
you can go back to your normal foods because now you have a fast metabolism
now if you need more information about Plateau I put that video right here

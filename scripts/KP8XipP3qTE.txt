it's hard to be excited about the benefits of a cucumber but
let's talk about cucumbers in general now sometimes i will switch it up
instead of having a big salad i'll have a couple cucumbers and
it's interesting because the cucumber has 73
different phenolic compounds which are just a type of phytonutrient
and another unique thing about cucumbers is they have certain phytonutrients
that are in cruciferous vegetables but not in other vegetables
except cucumbers now there's five basic benefits from cucumbers health-wise they
help stabilize your blood sugars they help stabilize your cholesterol by
helping reduce ldl increasing hdl decreasing triglycerides also they're a
good anti-inflammatory they are loaded with antioxidants very
powerful antioxidants all these right here and plus they
provide fiber to make butyrate so your microbes can take that
fiber and turn it into small chain fatty acids and this helps
with insulin resistance it feeds the colon cells
it gives the colon cells energy now the question is how do we extract these
phytonutrients and a lot of them are fat soluble
now in order to extract these from plants
there's three main things you can do one is you can ferment
them okay when you ferment a vegetable now that's different from pickling which
i'll talk about in a second when you ferment them you actually
release more phytonutrients you make more
phytonutrients available for you to use so when you go to the grocery
store the great majority of pickles
are basically just cucumbers with some added acid
when you do that you do not enhance the phytonutrients you don't
make them more available now when you eat pickled anything it's going
to help your digestion to some degree but you're not going to get the maximum
benefits of getting these right here but when you ferment them you will
so one of the brands that i recommend is bubbies pickles they have sauerkraut
really high quality product and that's a true fermented product
where they add a bacteria lactobacillus and then what happens it ferments the
carbohydrate and you get lactic acid it takes longer
but you have the release of these phytonutrients so
i would always recommend if you're going to eat pickles go with the fermented
pickles it should say it right on the label you'll just get more
health benefits so that's the first way to extract these
fat soluble phytonutrients from vegetables the next way is to steam them
a little bit don't overcook them but when you steam
them you will also release some of the phytonutrients which is
interesting and the last thing you can do
is you could eat them with fat and what i do is i do cucumbers with
hummus not the typical hummus that has the soy oil
or even the safflower oil i want it with the olive oil
so i get my hummus from the farmer's market or i will go to a healthy store
to find it but adding some of the tahini butter
which isn't a fat with cucumber will help you
extract these phytonutrients now you can also add olive oil so you
cut your cucumber on your salad add olive oil and you'll extract it
that way as well but these are the three ways to enhance the phytonutrients
from plants in general thanks for watching

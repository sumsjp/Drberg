you know in the morning i usually bring
my wife coffee and uh usually
i'm up a lot earlier uh after my deep
dive in
researching and things and of course i
always bring up some interesting
conversations
when she's sort of half asleep so this
morning i came in there and i said hey
karen
have you ever pondered this idea on the
relationship between
someone's breath and their microbial
diversity of course she just gives me
that look like
what and then i proceeded to talk about
is it the microbial imbalance
that can alter someone's mood
or is it the mood that can affect the
microbiome
and her response was
i need more coffee so anyway hopefully
you're awake today and i can talk to you
about this
but the relationship between your mood
and your microbiome is very very
interesting
if you are in kind of a state of anxiety
chronic stress and worry or depression
your microbiome greatly changes okay and
your breath changes as well and this is
why when someone's chronically stressed
um their breath can become pretty nasty
when someone is in a depressed state
chronically
they can develop halitosis even the
pathogenic
microbes that give off that sulfur smell
are
increased when you're in that state and
a lot of the protective friendly
bacteria are diminished someone who's
even at risk for periodontal infections
and disease when they're under chronic
stress but typically when someone is
stressed or has anxiety or
some even a panic attack their breath
changes dramatically and on the flip
side of that
when someone takes an antibiotic or an
antifungal and they wipe out
their microbial population
that can dramatically affect their mood
and their breath because you're altering
these microbial
communities so this is why
one of the big side effects from an
antibiotic is an overgrowth of yeast in
your mouth like thrush that gives off
kind of a bad odor
and if you look at some of the side
effects from antibiotics you could have
psychosis
major depression
anxiety
and even panic attacks now as far as one
reason for this physical reason
we have this spike in cortisol when we
go through panic attacks when we go
through chronic stress we have or worry
we have this spike in cortisol
cortisol it greatly suppresses the
diversity of the different types of
species of microbes that you have and it
basically paralyzes your immune system
which your microbes are a big big part
this is why chronic elevation of
cortisol
can affect your breath because it
destroys the microbes i mean if you even
think about when someone cries for
example
it affects their entire physiology and
the same thing that happens when someone
is actually in a chronic state of
depression so brushing your teeth or
using perfumes or breath mints
are not going to work unless you handle
the source of depression or handle the
source of
anxiety or worry but on the flip side if
you had an antibiotic and that affect
your mood you have to reestablish
this microbial life but one thing you
have to realize and this is something
new for a lot of people is you don't
just have
strains of bacteria you have a complex
group
of friendly
bacteria
friendly yeast friendly fungus and they
all work together very similar to the
microbes in the soil like when you're
gardening you need the right ratios of
bacteria to the fungal population if
you're too heavy in the bacteria and not
enough fungus you're not going to have
the mobilization of the nutrients and so
we don't want too much of one population
we want the correct ratio of fungus to
bacteria the same thing in your gut you
should start eating foods that are
fermented for example that have healthy
yeast as well as bacteria like
kefir like sauerkraut things like that
so you have the microbiome okay
that's all the friendly microbes but you
also have
mycobiome that's myco biome that is the
population of friendly funguses in your
body so we need
both and so when you take an antibiotic
and you kill off your microbes and then
you get a yeast infection it's because
these yeast and fungus now become
competitive they no longer are friendly
i wanted to just increase your awareness
that your mood can affect your microbes
and your microbes can also affect your
mood and you want to identify what is
the real cause of that and you can use
your breath as an indicator of what's
happening to your microbes because the
quality of your breath is directly
related to
mainly your balance of the right
microbes i know i've done a lot of
videos on chronic stress
and depression and there can be some
nutritional reasons for that like
vitamin d is the best
nutrient for depression and vitamin b1
is the best antidote for anxiety so you
might want to try that but also just
being out in the sun being out in nature
getting more space
changing your environment is so so so
important versus being stuck in the
house watching the news all day very
very bad to keep your mood up now as far
as exercise goes if you compare physical
work outside to going to a gym on a
treadmill
the physical workout side is going to be
hands down way better as a therapy
because it gets your mind off the stress
way more than being on a treadmill
especially when you're watching the news
on the treadmill but i do want to say
one of the best exercises that i found
for for mental stress is indoor rock
climbing boy there's nothing better than
doing rock climbing just to extract you
from your stress
but you can do the same thing with
hiking outside and there's many of
exercises that will help
now of course your diet is something
that i would really focus on because if
you're not on the right eating plan and
if you're doing too many carbs and
you're not doing the keto or not doing
intermittent fasting especially boy
that's going to keep you in a lowered
mood for sure but just implementing
intermittent fasting has a dramatic
effect on the cognitive function it'll
bring you out of anxiety and put you in
a great state of mind now i put some
links down below some great videos that
you can watch on how to re-establish the
friendly flora in your gut
but if you haven't seen my video
on panic attacks it's a simple technique
you can do to pull yourself out of not
just a panic attack but any type of
anxiety or stress
check it out right here

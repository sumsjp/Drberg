so i've created a lot of videos on insulin
and blood sugars and diabetes but there's another hormone
that works with insulin that i haven't talked about very
often so i wanted to cover it and make it really simple it's called glucagon
it sounds like glucose but it's not glucose it's a hormone
that opposes insulin so it kind of works in opposite
to insulin so let's just take a look at what glucagon does
in relationship to ketosis ketosis is a state of fat burning
glucagon turns the switch on for ketosis insulin turns it off so insulin blocks
ketosis glucagon releases stored
sugar stored sugar is called glycogen okay and your liver in your muscles so
glucagon will release this into glucose as fuel insulin
will store glucose as glycogen and as fat whereas glucagon will release
the stored sugar glycogen into glucose and it'll turn the fat into ketones
okay so it's just the opposite function so insulin lowers the sugar in the blood
glucagon will raise it where does it get the sugar from right
here the stored sugar and the fat so it's a
counter hormone to insulin so let's say for example you have too much insulin
and it shoves your blood sugar way down and you get hypoglycemia
okay you get the shakes and you're craving everything well normally
glucagon is supposed to kick in there and counter that it's kind of like a
counter regulating hormone that keeps the blood
sugars where it needs to be realize that glucagon is one of the fat
burning hormones as well now if we take a look at insulin insulin
is the dominating hormone in other words in the presence of insulin glucagon will
be lowered insulin knocks you out of
ketosis glucagon puts you into ketosis
insulin is triggered by carbohydrates protein okay and eating
right here protein now you're probably thinking wow protein's going to knock me
out of ketosis well look at over here glucagon
also is triggered by protein so protein will trigger both hormones so
that will counter the negative effect of insulin fyi so you don't have to worry
about protein knocking a lot of ketosis unless you consume
a lot of it vigorous exercise will trigger
glucagon adrenaline will trigger glucagon what triggers adrenaline
vigorous exercise stress will do it too this is one of the
reasons why people will lose weight during stress
but chronic stress they gain weight because the cortisol
when you experience stress acute stress you have more adrenaline
chronic stress you're going to have more cortisol issues
now there's a thing called GIP this is a hormone that's triggered by
eating so look over here every time you eat
insulin is triggered every time you eat glucogon is triggered as well again we
have a situation where eating will trigger insulin
but also glucagon when eating protein you'll stimulate both
hormones now when you're fasting you will trigger glucagon and when
you're eating you'll trigger insulin what will inhibit glucagon
high sugar in the diet and insulin i hope you got that
but that's the simplicity of what glucagon is
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up
watch the recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy
making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

one of the most important things when you're on a ketogenic diet is to really understand how to
read a label and to read labels on a regular basis because if you're not there's all sorts of hidden
carbs that can creep into this so i wanted to give you some basics on what you should look at
on a label the most important things so you'll see this little thing on the back
called nutritional facts there's two things at the top it says serving size
and servings per container or per unit so let's say for example you're buying chocolate of course
the only chocolate you should be buying would be the keto friendly but let's say
for example it's just a chocolate bar and let's say the serving size is one of those little
cubes right those little tiny cubes and there's 12 of those cubes in a whole bar so
this entire label as far as the carbohydrates and the sugars and the proteins and the fats
are based on the serving size not the servings for the entire container or the entire chocolate bar
and the reason i'm bringing that up is because if you're eating more than one serving size
which most people do let's say you ate the whole chocolate bar you have to multiply 12 times
the number of sugars to really see how much sugar or multiplied by the carbohydrates to see
how much carbohydrate you're getting and you're going to find out it's a massive amount okay so
just pay attention to that all right so then you have the total carbs which is very important and
then you have the fiber you minus the fiber and you get the net carbs okay so why because
even though fiber is a carbohydrate it doesn't increase insulin it doesn't get digested by you
it gets digested by your microbes in your gut but it doesn't spike insulin and then you get
to sugars right we want to keep those as low as possible so when i read a label i'm focusing on
carbs fiber and sugar now the next point is very important when you do keto you should have a
net carb of between 20 and 50 grams of carbs you shouldn't have more than 50 grams right
but what's also very very important is the type of carbs the quality of carbohydrate
because if you're getting your carbohydrates from pure sugar or high fructose corn syrup or
something that's high in the glycemic index then that is going to make it a lot less
keto friendly and so we have the limit of carbs and then we have the type of carbs we want low
glycemic carbohydrates when you're doing dirty keto for example you're not really looking at
the ingredients so i don't recommend doing dirty keto so even though that like a substance called
maltodextrin might be in the ingredients and they might say it's keto friendly because
they're saying it's well it's just small amounts yeah but on a glycemic index it's
higher than glucose it's like one of the highest glycemic substances i wouldn't call it a food
ever okay so it's very very high so it's going to create more problems with your blood sugar
then we have other ones like dextrose which is a synthetic sugar which you want to avoid
and then we have other things that are i consider not very high in the on the quality list of
healthy corn fiber okay is it is it gmo does it have residues of glyphosate how is it processed
not excited about corn fiber tapioca not excited about that one and then some products even
keto friendly breads have wheat in there now why would you put wheat in there that's that's
not keto friendly or they might have gluten which is the protein in the wheat which a lot of people
have allergies to in sensitivities to or they're intolerant as in gluten intolerance okay so it's
a little bit different than analogy but they can rip up their stomach so you don't want to use
wheat or gluten and any products that you consume and even some keto products have sugar in them
which is kind of crazy so when it says keto friendly read the ingredients and you'll find
that a lot of times it's not really keto friendly it may fit within the certain carbohydrate amounts
but they're not the type of carbohydrates that you want to be putting in your body
now moving right along when you get to the ingredients at the bottom part
usually the first ingredient is the majority of the product and this is interesting when you buy
multivitamins if it has calcium carbonate as the first ingredient then you know the majority of
that product is calcium carbonate and that's limestone and it's like a rock first of all
it's not very well digested in your body you don't really absorb it too well and they're
basically selling you a bunch of vitamins as a paperweight because it's just basically
a rock with some other synthetic vitamins and minerals and they're making a tremendous a profit
yet the quality is terrible and so a lot of other products their first ingredient is
soy and so then you know the other ingredients in addition to that soy are just small amounts and
i'm talking about salad dressings and mayonnaise i mean they're basically just soy oil products
now sometimes we'll say it's organic soy but it's still soy it's estrogenic so i recommend
you don't consume any soy sometimes they'll say your salad dressing is made with olive oil right
and then you look at the back label and it says it has soy with the olive oil so
you want salad dressing just with olive oil without any soy another little thing
they'll do is they'll instead of putting msg or monosodium glutamate they'll put modified
food starch okay modified food starch is msg and then the other thing they might put is they might
put a certain oil they may even say olive oil and then in parentheses or soy canola coconut
safflower or cottonseed oil so now they have an option to use whatever oil that they want and so
you probably could have guessed that they're going to use the cheapest one they can find
so just be aware of that so i always read labels and it's amazing how people are surprised after
they buy the product and they're like oh my gosh now i got to shoot this out so read labels always

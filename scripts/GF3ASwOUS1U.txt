did you realize that most of the wasabi out there is actually fake yeah true wasabi
is very hard to grow and it's very expensive it's like 160 a kilogram but 95% of all the wasabi
sold at sushi restaurants are made from something else horseradish mustard
either green food coloring or spinach juice yeah i'm not kidding because in order to get
the true wasabi which by the way has a massive health benefit you would have to go to japan
or go to very specialized restaurants that serve it and so if you ever buy it in the store out of a
bottle or can make sure you read the ingredients at these restaurants that wasabi is served they're
served as a root and they give you a little grater so you can actually grate it because
the optimum time of flavor is about one minute okay but there's all these receptors for wasabi
in your sinuses and your lung and your throat and this is why when you consume either wasabi or the
horseradish and mustard you're going to actually your nose is going to run and your eyes might
water because they stimulate the receptor that is involved with pain and inflammation actually
but anyway wasabi has various phytonutrients that when combined when you grate them or shred them
or crush the the plant you stimulate a very special phytonutrient called isocyanates okay
and this is very anti-cancer and it's 3,000 times more concentrated in wasabi than it is in cabbage
and it's very bitter and very spicy personally i cannot consume wasabi or even the horseradish or
mustard that is proposed as wasabi i just cannot consume it sometimes i've eaten it
by mistake and oh my gosh it just burns my sinuses and my throat but the health benefits of wasabi
are off the chart potent anti-cancer potent antimicrobial that's probably why they use
it with raw fish if there's any microbes growing in the raw fish it will kill it
great cardiovascular support respiratory support has anti-inflammatory effects it's a very powerful
antioxidant and it will also thin your mucus thus the drainage of the sinuses all right thanks for

i want to give you some data on a1c it's a really good predictor of all sorts of diseases so what is
a1c it's simply a test that gives you feedback on your average blood sugars for two to three months
in this measurement is something called glycated hemoglobin now what is glycadamine and what does
hemoglobin mean hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells glycated or glycation is basically
glucose sticking to the protein so when you expose this hemoglobin protein
to too much glucose it becomes glycated and so the quantity of sugar and protein combining together
will raise your a1c so for example if you have an a1c of 4 your blood sugars are roughly about 68.
if you have an a1c of 5 it's about 97 but typically if it's lower fives it could be like in
the 80s so higher fives like 5.8 5.9 would be like 98. then you get 6 which is the blood sugar of 126
and if you get 7 you have a blood sugar of roughly about 152 and if it's an 8 it's 183 and it keeps
going higher and higher and higher so a1c is a really good test to tell you what your average
blood sugars are it's much better than a one-time glucose test because it tells you what's happening
over a period of time and so if you're doing really good through the week yet on the weekends
you go off your plan you eat a lot of sugar you're not going to probably have good a1c and so high
a1c really is high carbohydrate diet now there are many disease processes that occur when you
have high a1c because the high sugar starts to create a lot of oxidation in problems with all
sorts of tissues but there are four main tissues that high glucose affects one is the combination
of your brain and nervous system and so we have brain dysfunction and that can be anything from
alzheimer's to parkinson's to dementia there's a whole series of descriptive problems with
brain dysfunction then you have nerve issues you have peripheral neuropathies which occur
in the lower extremities like your feet and the bottom of your feet become numb painful
burning same thing with your fingertips right so what's happening you're getting oxidation in a
circulatory system which is going to the nervous system and it's starving off the tiny nerves
on the very end part it's called the peripheral nerves but there's many other issues you can
have you can have autonomic neuropathy which the autonomic nervous system is becoming dysfunctional
and that can affect your digestion your sleep cycles then we have the eye retinopathy the retina
is the extension of the brain it's nervous tissue and that becomes majorly damaged when you expose
it with a lot of glucose but when you have high glucose you also have cataracts you have glaucoma
you have many different issues with the lens of the eye and one big side effect from diabetes is
you go blind then you're going to have problems with the arteries the vessels the coronary artery
it's called endothelial dysfunction and so you expose the inside of your artery with glucose
you basically rust out the inside then you have inflammatory processes you get a clot you get
plaquing you can get a stroke or a heart attack so your brain and nervous system the eye the
artery and the kidney okay those are the four main tissues and with the kidney the same thing happens
if you expose the kidney with too much sugar you damage that inside filter because the kidney is a
filter and so you then start leaking out all sorts of things so you have different stages of kidney
disease now there's a couple things i want to mention as far as solving a1c yes you need to
cut your carbs down for sure and yes you need to reduce the frequency of eating that's called
intermittent fasting both of those actions are going to greatly improve your a1c very very
rapidly but there's something else you can do for the complications of all these diseases in other
words there's something you can do to reduce the symptoms of exposing glucose to these tissues you
can take b1 but you would want to take it in the form of a fat soluble vitamin called benfotamine
you see what happens is this high level of glucose depletes vitamin b1 which is essential for the
metabolism and breakdown of the sugar and so as you have high levels of sugar you deplete your b1
and you get a lot of complications including more glycation more oxidants more free radical damage
so if you're a diabetic if you're a pre-diabetic i would highly recommend in addition to reducing
your carbs and doing intermittent fasting also take some ben photome i would take probably four
per day four pills per day and you're going to see amazing results with your symptoms you may even
still be a diabetic but you'll have a lot less symptoms you're going to notice your vision
is going to be better less complications with peripheral neuropathy less issues with your kidney
better focus and better cardiovascular function now if you haven't seen my other videos on v1 and
benfotamine i put a link down below check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

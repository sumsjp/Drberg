today i'm going to answer some questions on my youtube channel someone wanted to know can a
product with dextrose still be classified as keto and the answer is technically maybe it
really depends on how much dextrose preferably you want carbohydrates that are low glycemic
which means they don't create a huge spike in your blood sugars now the essence of what makes
keto keto is the low carb the carbs need to be below 50 grams or less per day and then what's
left is moderate protein and high fat if the fats high if your protein is moderate and your carbs
are high that is not keto so to really be keto it has to be low carb preferably below 30 grams
per day but it can go up as high as 50 grams as your carbs become higher and higher above 50 grams
you're gonna have less and less ketones so what you're doing is you're depriving your body of
carbohydrates so then it's forced to burn fat and make ketones out of fat now a carbohydrate is a
term to describe fiber sugar and starch now let's take a bagel for example one bagel is 50 grams
of carbohydrate and a bagel only has 2 grams of fiber so when you don't have enough fiber
you don't have that buffer for that blood sugar spike so the lower amount of fiber the higher the
glycemic index and then in a bagel you have seven grams of sugar i consider that on the high side if
you're going to consume something you probably want to keep it two grams of sugar or less
but seven grams of sugar pretty high for one bagel now the question is what is left what's left is
starch and what a starch is it's the string of glucose molecules stuck together and so on the
body it's going to break down and it's going to then spike your blood sugars and there's
some other variables as well which i don't want to get into in this video i'll put a link down below
for that video but for example if you were to eat a raw potato a lot of it's starch it won't
affect your blood sugars because it's not heated like if you're going to consume a potato chip
or a french fry or cook potatoes as in mashed potatoes the heat breaks down the enzymes which
make these glucose molecules very available so when you eat them you're going to really spike
your blood sugars now recently there are so many people coming out with so-called keto-friendly
foods desserts that are really not keto friendly so here are some ingredients you'd want to avoid
if you see these in the keto friendly foods dextrose maltodextrin dextrin that stands for
iso malto oligosaccharides at one time i thought that was keto friendly but i found some data
that showed that it's not very keto friendly i did a video on it i'll put the link down below
corn syrup sugar raw sugar sometimes people think because it's raw it's keto friendly no that's not
true tapioca not keto friendly fructose coconut sugar agava nectar honey maple syrup molasses
all of those are not keto friendly and of course avoid pasta bread grains fruit unless they're
berries in certain quantities corn and potato hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

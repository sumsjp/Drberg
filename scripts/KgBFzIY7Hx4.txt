let's talk about the number one cause of hypertension now hypertension is
classified in two different categories one is primary or essential hypertension
and then you have secondary hypertension which mainly comes from a kidney disease
or maybe a tumor etc but the vast majority 95% of hypertension is called essential or primary
which basically means unknown cause now that can be related to lifestyle salt smoking alcohol
etc etc but if you dive into research on this which i'm going to put some links down below
there's a lot of data that points to having too much insulin as in hyperinsulinemia now with
a hyper insulin state too much insulin you're always going to have insulin resistance as well
so the fact that you have insulin resistance will cause the pancreas to make more insulin
and having more insulin will then cause those receptors to downgrade
and cause insulin resistance so they both feed on each other now one of the mechanisms of why
high insulin will do this is that when you have high insulin it stimulates the autonomic nervous
system primarily the sympathetic nervous system which which has one effect of raising the blood
pressure the other thing that high amounts of insulin will do it it'll make the arteries
very very stiff causing hypertension and of course the best thing to do which is rarely ever done is
to do a test to see if you have insulin resistance and high insulin levels while you're fasting
this is the test that should be done homa ir if you had hypertension and you did this test chances
are you would find that you do have insulin resistance and high insulin which by the way is
behind type 2 diabetes it is the thing that brews in the oven for many many years until you develop
pre-diabetes and then actual type 2 diabetes so this is number one and by the way this is
also behind the metabolic syndrome where you have high blood pressure high glucose high cholesterol
belly fat now there are several other reasons why someone's blood pressure might go up as well
low potassium but here's the thing if you have too much insulin and insulin resistance you're
going to end up with low potassium because because you need normal functioning insulin to be able to
absorb potassium and the other reason why this is a common cause is because we need so much of it
dietarily we need 4700 milligrams every single day instead they're really heavy on the sodium
and very light on the potassium but for a lot of people they'll just increase their potassium level
they'll supplement it and all of a sudden their blood pressure comes down so this is a really
common cause too that can be aggravated by this right here all right number three low vitamin d
levels vitamin d has a very powerful effect over blood pressure and the vast majority is vitamin d
deficient and a good percentage of them have high blood pressure will show there's a correlation
but there's been a lot of studies and i'm going to put some down below that show that when you
take vitamin d your blood pressure comes down and i would recommend if you have hypertension to take
at least 20000 IUs maybe even more to help you with your blood pressure and sometimes it takes
a couple days before you see the results but you can test yourself before and after
number four low magnesium magnesium is an electrolyte it works with potassium
you also need vitamin d to help you absorb magnesium and also magnesium helps you absorb
vitamin d and it just so happens that magnesium is in the same foods that you would eat with
potassium but magnesium is a relaxer of your blood vessels and if you don't have enough magnesium
things tend to stay stiff and your pressure will go up number five low vitamin k2 which you need
with vitamin d3 they work together vitamin k2 helps to keep the calcium out of the arteries
where it should not be and so if you are deficient in vitamin k2 you could potentially
build up more calcium in the arteries and that can make things very very stiff and this comes
from fatty foods so if you're in a low-fat diet you're going to be deficient in vitamin
k2 also if you're on a statin drug which blocks cholesterol that can inhibit this as well as well
as this right here and also statin drugs increase your risk of getting this right here so if you're
new to my channel and you're not familiar with healthy keto and intermittent fasting
i put a link down below for more information to help you with this right here but what it
can do is help you support a healthy lifestyle as well as to help you support healthy insulin
levels because you're reducing carbohydrates and if i were to look at the ketogenic diet
and intimate fasting on what would be a greater impact on helping you lower insulin
i would go with intermittent fasting but the combination works even better and one last point
this information is not meant to replace your medical care don't stop taking medication
unless you check with your doctor first before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

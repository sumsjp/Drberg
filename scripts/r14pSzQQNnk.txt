so how effective is chemotherapy really
the contribution of chemo to a five-year survival rate in adults in one report which
i'm going to put a link down below in australia it's only 2.3 percent and if you live in the u.s
it's only 2.1 now what does that mean it means that if you had a group of people who took chemo
at the end of five years only 2.1 percent of them would still be alive the rest would be dead
now what i'm going to tell you is not meant to replace your medical care check with your doctor
before taking any advice i'm not telling you in this video not to do chemo i'm just giving
you information that i suggest that you need to research there's two really important definitions
that i want to talk about one is relative risk and the other is absolute risk when you're being told
the effectiveness of a drug or some treatment you really don't want to know the relative risk
you want to know the absolute risk let's say for example before chemo it was found that two
people out of 100 die and after chemo one out of 100 would die what would the relative risk
look like well it would look like this chemo decreases cancer mortality rate by 50
if you take the chemo you'll have more than a 2x chance of surviving for five years so chemo
will double your rate of survival that sounds very hopeful doesn't it let's take a look at what
it actually means now if we take a look at these numbers okay and if we look at the absolute risk
it gives a different picture chemo decreases cancer mortality rate
by one percent okay because we're going from two to one remember these are fractions they're not
whole numbers so drug companies and certain people that want to make their study look
way better than it really is will always talk about relative risks okay
and they won't mention this right here if you have cancer and you're presented with chemo the only
thing you want to know is how long will it prolong your life right here that's what you need to find
out so you ask your doctor if i take this chemo how much longer am i going to live that's what you
need to know and then after they tell you you want to request the study and actually read it yourself
to see if it matches up so we have two problems number one we want to know what their definition
of effectiveness is and number two we want to know how safe it is because chemo is a poison
because if it barely gives you any results and at the same time it's adding some major toxicity you
want to really weigh out your choices now the other thing that i would do if i was talking to
an oncologist is i would want to know if they are open to alternative therapy or natural type things
because there is some significant science behind using natural things to affect cancer and you just
want to know if they're open to it and if they're open to it great if they're not all that tells you
is they have a fixed idea and they're unwilling to look at the information that's out there
and the last thing i want to mention is if you haven't seen my interview with Dr. Seyfried
on cancer i think you'll find it very interesting check it out i put it up right here

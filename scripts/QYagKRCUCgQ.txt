hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about orange juice now you might have
heard that it's a health food thing like people think they're getting some health benefit from it
but check this out it has the same amount of sugar as a can of soda a 12 ounce can of coke there's
nine teaspoons of sugar so it's sugar water so you say well I'm getting the vitamin C right well
they have to pasteurize it that means heated at high temperatures you have to boil it why to kill
off anything so it can last on the shelf a lot longer so it can be stored because orange juice
is seasonal and what happens is they pasteurize it to last through the whole season so basically
they severely lower the vitamin C content okay a lot of times we'll add ascorbic acid back into the
vitamin C and you think you're getting the vitamin C but it's just it's synthetic it's enriched with
an artificial C ascorbic acid is one small part of the vitamin C complex in the stuff that they put
back in it's synthetic and it's made form from cornstarch which has no vitamin C and sulfuric
acid and this makes it ascorbic acid which basically to me my view point it's not
really vitamin C it's an artificial thing so you get this thing where you have low nutrition high
sugar and then when they heat it and they have to pasteurize it you lose some of the flavor
sometimes they have to add the flavor back in so I just wanted to kind of reveal what's behind this
whole orange juice thing and if you're going to do orange juice you know make it yourself but again
if you're trying to lose weight it's not a good idea but the point is if you do eat the orange by
itself with all the fiber and everything instead of a juicing it and taking the pulp away you'll
have a much less effective of that insulin spike as well all right thanks for watching

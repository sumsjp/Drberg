I'm want to talk about viruses now what is a virus it's a very mysterious
thing for a lot of people but viruses you can't kill them because they're
really not alive in the first place there are pieces of genetic material
wrapped in a little bit of a shell and they're very very tiny compared to
bacteria if a virus was a ping-pong ball a bacteria would be the size of the
Empire State Building so they're very very tiny some viruses are so small you
can drop them through a porcelain dish for through the little holes that they
have so viruses basically are an inactive creature that actually kind of
is like a parasite in a way but because it it takes something from you
but it doesn't give you anything back at least bacteria helps you in some ways
but viruses just take but they don't give back so once your cells are
susceptible to the virus then they can start to invade your own cell machinery
and start to switch switch on the duplicator so basically that's how
viruses reproduce off your own energy from your own cells they kind of lock in
they're very similar to computer viruses so what happens is that if you notice
you have shingles pain that's like pain down a nerve root on your back or you
have herpes virus or you have some venereal virus type thing or mono that's
Epstein-Barr virus these viruses are nearly always triggered by a stress
event which is fascinating because when you ever ask someone when did you first
start getting that that thing it was after some stress event and that's why
stress is one of the big activators because it activates the virus it comes
out of remission and then the cascade effect that you start going through this
whole cycle could be like a 10-day cycle maybe two weeks before you can get over
this viral infection because antibiotics do not fix viruses also you
can have certain malnutrition deficiencies that can lead to more
over loads as well if you're eating a lot of sugar and junk foods you don't have
the proper nutrition that can do it but the main thing that will set you up for
a viral infection is low calcium calcium will protect you if you have enough
calcium so if you have a virus let's say it's a herpes virus or cold sore or
shingles what I'm going to recommend is taking calcium take a calcium citrate
and add it with omega-3 fatty acid and it doesn't matter if you get omega-3
from flax oil or cod liver oil or fish oil you want a good omega-3 with the
calcium and trace minerals all together and that many times will speed up the
healing or they put the virus back in remission and I like to give this to
like even kids that get fevers from a virus because you can actually get them
over it very fast so that's the summary of what a virus is and that's why you
can't kill it because it's not alive in the first place hey guys thank you so
much for watching I really appreciate it please click the share button below and
I will see you in the next video

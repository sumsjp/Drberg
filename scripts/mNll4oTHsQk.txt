let's talk about depression and the hpa axis now what does hpa stand for hypothalamus pituitary and
adrenals okay so we have this feedback mechanism a certain hormone is made by the hypothalamus which
is kind of like the true master gland and it's sent down to the pituitary which is like the
middle man it's like you have the owner of the football team and then you have the coach right
and then the coach then gives it to one of the players and that communication is
another hormone that then tells the adrenals what to do and so the adrenals then make
its hormones and we're going to be talking about the cortisol which then creates its effect
and then there's a signal sent back to the pituitary and hypothalamus to turn off that
communication so we have a communication cycle where we're sending messages that's being received
and then there's a return communication to turn off that communication because we don't want
cortisol to keep going because that's going to burn out your body which is exactly what happens
when you keep stimulating cortisol with chronic stress there's also something in
your brain that cortisol affects and that's called a hippocampus which involves memory
learning and what happens with high levels of cortisol over a longer period of time
you have a shrinkage of the hippocampus and that's going to affect your memory okay
so what is the relationship between this hpa access and depression it's the over stimulation
of the sympathetic nervous system and the flight or fight mechanism
the first thing that's going to happen with someone is they're going to get anxiety
and then as time goes on it starts to go into depression on the flip side you
have the opposing system it's called the parasympathetic nervous system and so we
have the sympathetic which is fight or fight and the parasympathetic which is the rest in digest
the parasympathetic well both systems are like a wave system in the body the
sympathetic nervous system raises the pulse rate for example and then the parasympathetic kicks in
let's say after you stop exercising and it's a push down wave mechanism that brings things back
to normal when that system is dysregulated you can also develop depression okay so you
can actually predict depression if you have a malfunctioning parasympathetic nervous system so
we have two things we have a dysfunction with an overactive uh flight or fight mechanism and
then we have another problem where we lose the brake pads the thing that's supposed to
recover us so you can develop depression from both mechanisms now what can someone do if they have
depression from chronic stress well reduce the cause of the stress whatever that is
it must be reduced number two magnesium helps support and helps normalize an overactive hpa axis
mechanism now fasting really can help someone fasting not only brings up your emotional state
and is one of the best things for depression but can also reduce the stress on the hpa axis
now of course i would always recommend combining it with ketones because ketones are part of that
because when you put someone in ketosis it's a much better fuel and then you go away from
burning glucose because glucose can also affect someone's mood and bring them into a blood sugar
anxiety or even a depression aerobic exercise is also very therapeutic of reversing the damage to
the hippocampus because we want to flood the brain with lots of oxygen so a lot of long
walks would be very therapeutic vitamin d vitamin d not only is great for someone who is depressed
but it can support the hypothalamus pituitary adrenals and especially cortisol vitamin d is
a steroid hormone and so it can help support the adrenals and
anytime someone has a an elevated cortisol they're usually going to be depleted of vitamin d now the
herb rhodiola is another really good herb that can act as an adaptogen for these problems don't
forget to focus on your sleep because if you're not sleeping it's going to be virtually impossible
to reverse the damage in the system and then vitamin b1 from nutritional yeast is also very
very important in supporting stress in general hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put
a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

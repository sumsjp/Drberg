hi guys I want to answer a question what
is a ketone if you look this up there's
so much complexities you have to
understand organic chemistry to figure
it out but real simply a ketone is a
byproduct of fat being burned okay it's
an alternative fuel source to
glucose it's a preferred fuel it's a
more efficient fuel for the brain and
the heart and it actually is H better
for your metabolism than running your
body on glucose but it's triggered by
the absence
of
carbohydrates okay so when you get rid
of the carbohydrates your body then will
transfer over and adapt to ketones okay
so it's a more efficient fuel source so
uh I put some links Down Below on how to
get into ketosis but I want to just
Define what a ketone is so you just have
the basics thanks so much for watching

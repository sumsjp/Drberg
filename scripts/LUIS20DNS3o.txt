so i want to give you my opinion on colon cleansing there's several
different types you have colon hydrotherapy where you're
putting water up through the rectum into the large
intestines and then you're flushing everything out
okay herbal laxatives create a purging of the material out
from your colon then you have something called the
colema which is a combination of an enema
and a colonic because you're using an enema tube but you're also flushing
water up through here and pulling it out this is that was developed by bernard
jensen i've done it three or four times a very long time ago
the problem with that is that it's very very temporary
i actually experienced a lot of good benefits but the other problem is it
flushes out your electrolytes okay and if you're
already deficient you can feel very dizzy it can affect
your heart and even a colonic can also flush electrolytes so you better make
sure you put those back in so you're not deficient not to
mention you're also flushing out your friendly bacteria you have to put
that back in there as well because some people that get this done
end up with constipation because they they just basically wiped out their good
bacteria and they haven't put it put it back in
one of the problems with the colema is that one of the things that
you're doing in addition to eating the food is you
you are drinking apple juice and it's going to keep that blood sugar up
you're going to feel miserable because you actually never get into a state of
ketosis because you're drinking this apple juice
causing your body to be dependent on glucose
and not your own fat so you have this constant crash in blood sugars
all i thought about and dreamt about on this program was at the end of it i was
going to really consume a large amount of pizza and
salty foods because i was so deficient they didn't
really put back those electrolytes and the apple juice was not a good idea
so my opinion is this why would you want to do this in the first place
what problem are you trying to solve do you have too many toxins in your
colon do you have ibs do you have polyps maybe you have constipation maybe you
have malabsorption problems even in the small intestine
maybe you have some type of itis ilitis diverticulitis
colitis in the small intestine or the large there's many different reasons for
for doing this but the first thing that i would recommend
is you must fix your diet because what you're normally going to find is if you
really fix this these things are usually going to
go away but i'm not against doing colon
hydrotherapy maybe for a short-term solution for
constant patient or other conditions but just realize
that it should be supervised and you better put your electrolytes back in
as well as the friendly bacteria but if you think long-term there's really two
things that you must do you must fix the diet
of course you know what i'm going to say you need to go on a keto diet
ketones have anti-inflammatory properties
it's going to greatly help your colon adding more carbohydrates adds more
inflammation to your digestive system but the most important thing is to start
doing fasting okay intermittent fasting why because the frequent eating goes
completely against how our digestive system was designed we
were not designed to eat so frequently we're cramming
so much food down this pipe where it never has a chance to completely clean
out where we're keeping our stomach our
small intestine our colon constantly filled with food it
overwhelms everything we get all sorts of malabsorption and
incomplete digestive cycles that's really where the problem is so
this right here is a vital vital vital if you're new to my channel
i put a link down below how to do it now fiber
talking about vegetable fiber it can be good or bad
most of the time it's going to be good most people can actually do
vegetables without a problem the benefit of that is
the phytonutrients that are very anti-cancer
anti-polyp anti-tumor not to mention anti-inflammatory and the
fiber feeds the friendly microbes which then
make a chemicals that are really good for you
that help your blood sugars they're also
anti-inflammatory however for some people consuming too
many vegetable fibers can tear up their colon
in which case they need to go carnivore for a while to actually
reduce that inflammation and reset probably for about a couple months
and the last thing i want to mention is fermented vegetables are very very
important now i want you to differentiate between
pickled vegetables versus fermented always get the
fermented if you are not familiar with that i put a link down below of
the difference between the two but fermented vegetables would be like
sauerkraut some pickles are fermented kimchi very
very good because you have the fiber and you have the probiotics all in
one it's very good for the digestive system
all right that's my opinion and i'm sticking to it
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

you know the big problem with growth
hormone is that
it decreases with age so
if you're noticing uh various things
with your joints
with your muscles
it could be the decline in growth
hormone but growth hormone is involved
in fat burning it's involved in
building up collagen and cartilage and
muscle and it also helps your endurance
when you exercise so it's involved in
performance it also helps you recover if
you have trauma like whether from an
injury surgery
or even a stroke and it's also involved
in the cognitive function of your brain
so
if you're low in growth hormone you may
find that that can affect your memory or
focus and your concentration also if you
are a young person
and you don't have enough growth hormone
it can actually
make you a bit shorter than you should
now i'm definitely not going to
recommend you take growth hormone
it's probably
a big problem in sports
but you don't need to do that okay there
are natural things that you can
do to boost growth hormone to counter
this aging process
it all starts with a hypothalamus okay
so you got this hypothalamus up in the
brain
that sends a signal down and tells the
pituitary
to release growth hormone so the growth
hormone is created by the pituitary but
there's another hormone up here that
tells the pituitary to create growth
hormone and then growth hormone goes
right to your liver
and it works through another hormone
called igf number one insulin-like
growth factor number one so in other
words igf number one does the work of
growth hormone so i just want to talk
about what will stimulate or boost
growth hormone
and then
on the flip side what will inhibit or
suppress growth hormone well guess what
in the deep part of your sleep when you
hit the delta wave
that's when you have a
major release of growth hormone so
of course if you're not sleeping you're
not going to have nearly as much growth
hormones so sleep is a very
potent way to keep the growth hormone
doing its job
number two intense exercise okay
not mild
exercise but intense exercise the more
intense the more growth hormone
stimulation so you have the potential to
increase your growth hormone by up to a
thousand percent
if you do intense exercise and i think
out of all the exercises
sprinting is at the top of the list but
there's a lot of other ones that you
could do to increase your pulse rate and
use your whole body to really activate
um this intensity that you need to do um
just kind of walking on the treadmill is
not going to do much to growth hormones
you're going to have to really
use a lot of effort okay intense effort
but guess what if you over train and you
don't get enough sleep
then you're it's probably not going to
work so we want to do this intense
exercise without over training this is
why we want to do high intensity
interval training okay short duration
lots of rest low blood sugars are
another uh powerful way to stimulate
growth from them right so guess what
that's on the keto plan that's on a low
carb diet so unfortunately diabetics who
have high amounts of sugar in their
blood because they're not told
about this dietary sugar and
carbohydrate connection usually it's all
about just managing your blood sugars
they usually have very low growth
hormone levels
so we want to keep the blood sugars low
to trigger growth
hormone number four amino acids so
protein so you need protein to stimulate
growth hormone so if you're not getting
enough protein guess what you're not
going to have enough growth hormone
there are several amino acids that will
trigger growth hormone but the big one
is arginine in one study they found that
you have to take between five and nine
grams of it to increase growth hormone
by 100
okay now i'm not recommending that you
go out and get arginine i don't think
you need to do it i just wanted to bring
it up as a potential thing to increase
your growth hormone sometimes
people are concerned about taking
protein especially branched amino acids
when they're fasting and having that
increase their blood glucose levels
and that can do it but apparently
arginine won't increase your blood sugar
level so that's interesting good to know
also there is a very unique amino acid
blend
that i recommend for certain people
that
need to maintain their muscle mass
during fasting that doesn't have the
same effect
of other proteins of turning into sugar
it's like i think
99.8 of it turns into muscle tissue so
you don't have that stimulation of
glucose which is good so i will put that
link down below if you fit into that
category but typically when you eat
protein so it's going to turn into
glucose that's going to increase insulin
and that's going to knock you out of the
benefits of fasting but the point is
that you need sufficient amino acids if
you want to
increase growth hormone number five
fasting
fasting has
the largest influence
over growth hormone okay you can
potentially increase
growth hormone by up to two thousand
percent if you're a male
if you're female you can increase it by
thirteen hundred percent
so
this is really really powerful so
i'm definitely recommending sleeping
more sleeping deeply adding fasting okay
doing keto and intense exercise those
are the the key factors here but then
you also have niacin which is vitamin b3
that has the potential to increase
growth hormone not by a lot but it can
definitely boost it then we have vitamin
d okay that you can get from the sun
no cost to that and that can increase
growth from let's talk about what can
inhibit growth hormone you got stress
and cortisol right which is going to
affect your sleep the more cortisol that
you're exposed to let's say from a
medication you're on prednisone for
example
the more stress you have the less growth
hormone you're going to have so if your
diet is high carbohydrate you're not
going to have nearly the amount of
growth hormone that you really need
also goes along with this
hyperinsulinemia okay so of course if
you're eating sugar you're going to have
high insulin
but high insulin also
will
knock down
growth hormone especially if it's
sustained or chronic elevation insulin
we see
you know great majority of the
population
and also
pre-diabetes and also the first part of
diabetes where your body is compensating
but eventually
the pancreas runs out of insulin and
then now the blood sugars go really
really high so then of course the doctor
might even give you more insulin to
regulate your blood sugars
all right next one obesity so the bigger
you are fat wise the less growth hormone
you're going to have why probably
because of this right here
hyperinsulinemia all right next one is
low thyroid if your thyroid is not
working correctly
you're not going to be able to nearly
produce
enough growth hormone
now since
growth hormone works through the liver
we need a healthy liver for that to work
so the more damage you have in your
liver the less growth hormone you're
going to have and i'm talking about a
fatty liver talking about
an inflamed liver and also cirrhosis of
the liver
alcohol has a pretty potent
inhibitory or suppressive effect over
growth hormone okay
and of course age as you age
you have less growth hormones so we're
really trying to do all these things to
compensate for this darn aging thing
that we're we're forced to deal with so
there you have it
kind of growth hormone in a nutshell
and i think
at this point it'd be very very smart to
get a little more information
about the main organ that you have
growth hormone connecting to
so check out this video on the liver

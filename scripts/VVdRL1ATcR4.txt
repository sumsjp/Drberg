so you're doing keto but the weight it's not coming off or it's very slow what can you do
now i've done a ton of videos on plateau i'm going to put some links down below but
i want to give you a a summary of three really important things okay related to slow weight loss
so number one the goal is to get your ketones from your own body fat not necessarily your diet
i really want to make that distinction because sometimes people think that keto is a high fat
diet no it's a low carb diet being on keto does not mean unlimited fat it doesn't mean that
you can keep eating these fat filled keto bombs all day long that's not going to work and drink
tons of mct oil and take these exogenous ketone supplements and thinking you're actually going
to lose weight no that's not going to happen because if you provide your body with dietary
fat or ketones and we compare that to your own fat the body is going to always use the dietary fat
and ketones first before it taps into your own fat and so if you're not losing weight that could be
the reason why you might need to cut down on some of the extra fat i would just consume the fat that
normally comes with the protein and also realize that dietary fat has more than double the calories
so when we say the ketogenic diet is 70 or 75 percent fat we're talking about calories that's
a little different than the size or the volume of fat and i think it's confusing for people
because they think they have to fill up half the plate with fat because it's 70 to 75 fat but what
they're missing is that if you take carbohydrates and protein and fat the fat calories are more than
double as far as the density of calories versus these other two all right let's go to number two
if you're having difficulty losing weight on keto you must add intermittent fasting why
because what determines how much weight you're going to lose and how deep you're into ketosis
is where your insulin is at and the way that you reduce your insulin is through a low carb diet
and through not eating so frequently as an intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting
so wherever you're at whether it's two meals a day go to one meal a day let's say for example you had
two meals a day that but once in the morning and once in the evening squish them together
so you have a longer fasting period you can add more fat to fast longer it makes it easier to go
longer if you're at one meal a day you might want to consider eating once every other day okay so
that's number two all right number three this is very important you need to understand if you have
a slow metabolism that means you have insulin resistance and insulin resistance comes from
years of consuming too many carbohydrates and eating too frequently in other words insulin
is not just raised by a high carb diet it's also raised by eating so you can create insulin
resistance you can make insulin resistance worse by consuming frequent meals three meals two snacks
okay so if you're grazing all day you can actually create insulin resistance like that so if we want
to reverse that and you want to improve insulin resistance and fix your stubborn metabolism
you need to reduce your carbs even lower you need to fast longer okay you can consume things like
berberine like a supplement that actually can help you lessen the insulin resistance you can
also take apple cider vinegar before bed that helps insulin resistance you can sleep longer
that improves insulin resistance because it lowers cortisol you can also add exercise which
also improves that insulin resistance and it makes insulin more sensitive all right try these things
and comment down below hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

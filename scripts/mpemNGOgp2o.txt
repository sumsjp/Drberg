you you feel less stressed cuz you're
getting you know the the acurate
pressure points uh worked on and I have
a little shoulder uh injury also so we
recently start working on the uh
shoulder so now I can actually lay on my
left side when I you know sleep at night
before I could not lay on my left side
at all so definitely I feel like a
little pep in my step once I leave the
uh the treatment

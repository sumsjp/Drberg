hey guys and another question about
probiotics and if someone is lactose
intolerant or sensitive to Dairy what do
they do because so many people are
taking yogurt and keeper and all these
fermented drinks to get their friendly
bacteria well first of all you can do
fermented vegetables you can also do
effective microbes you can look this up
there's some products out there that are
non-dairy microbes okay and I like
effective microbes are called e/m and
you can do a search and get them because
they have lots of different strains of
microbes but they're dairy free all
right check it out hey if you haven't

let's talk about intestinal permeability or leaky gut this is a situation where
there are holes in your intestine and your food particles are getting into these holes
into the lymphatic system and then your immune system is going to react to it you're going to
have all sorts of allergies you're gonna have inflammation then you're gonna get scar tissue
and now i've done other videos on this and i've talked more about certain foods that destroy your
gut lining and that cause a leaky gut like gluten for example taking antibiotics consuming foods
that are inflammatory but in this video i want to talk about another control mechanism that is
superior to that and it is the vagus nerve the vagus nerve comes from the brain stem and it goes
throughout the entire thorax into your abdomen it goes down into your pelvis and it's a very
long nerve and you actually have two of them okay and 80 of that nerve goes down and only 20 goes up
and so we have this huge communication network between our brain and our gut and so the vagus
nerve helps to maintain this intestinal barrier to prevent pathogens and other things from crossing
over into your body now they've done experiments on vagal nerve stimulation to show how that can
protect the gut barrier now from my experience i don't recommend stimulating your vagus nerve
there's other ways to go about this but they did find that when you stimulate the vagus nerve
it actually protects this barrier this gut barrier also low vagal activity so when there's low
function in your vagus nerve you have an increase in permeability and inflammation and so the vagus
nerve is all a part of something called the autonomic nervous system the vagus nerve is part
of the division called the parasympathetic and the parasympathetic is all about rest and digest
and so this division of the autonomic nervous system also helps you secrete hydrochloric acid
it helps you release enzymes from your pancreas it helps you release bile from your gallbladder it's
involved in peristalsis that's the pumping action of your colon it helps you prevent inflammation
and also controls the valves of the stomach above the stomach and below the stomach and
helping to prevent a condition called gerd and so the vagus nerve has this protective function
in the intestinal epithelial barrier now that's all very interesting but the question is what if
we have a problem with the vagus nerve what is the best thing to do well there just happens to be a
very key nutrient that supports the vagus nerve and that is thiamine and the question where does
it come from it comes from grains but here's the problem when you consume grains grains have gluten
and that will destroy the gut so you don't want to get your b1 from grains in fact consuming grains
creates a deficiency of b1 you want to get your b1 from nutritional yeast you can also get it from
sunflower seeds if you have gut issues i think it's very very important to not neglect vitamin
b1 in the control of intestinal permeability hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

let's talk about magnesium's effect on mood especially anxiety and depression
there's a lot of things that magnesium does in the body it's involved in probably actually more
than 300 different enzymes involved in biochemical pathways but i want to emphasize just one area the
effect of magnesium on neurotransmitters which are hormone-like but instead of traveling through the
blood they travel through the nervous system now a magnesium deficiency is extremely common well over
50 of the population is deficient and probably a lot more that have a subclinical deficiency
but it's very difficult to test magnesium since only one percent of your whole body's
magnesium is in the blood the rest is in the bone it's in the teeth it's in the muscle and it's also
inside the cell so you kind of have to go by symptoms and just take some magnesium consume
foods higher magnesium and see if these symptoms go away so if you're deficient in magnesium
you can get anxiety depression low tolerance to stress you're not going to sleep that well you're
going to be irritable and brain fog other than that you're going to be good to go but magnesium
has some direct effect on increasing serotonin serotonin is the hormone that kind of brings you
in a state of well-being it actually makes you feel calm happy and without stress number two
magnesium can decrease cortisol so cortisol is a stress hormone and if it's too high it puts you
in a state of stress so many people have chronic elevations of cortisol and they're stressed out
and magnesium can help them all right number three magnesium can lower adrenaline okay so
that's going to help your sleep number four you can increase gaba which is a neurotransmitter
involved in relaxation and feeling calm and even sleep number five magnesium can increase melatonin
it's going to help you sleep all right number six it can increase the parasympathetic nervous system
what is that that's the part of the nervous system that's responsible for rest and digestion
so it calms you down it's actually an active wave in your body that's pushing things down to keep
things calm so let's say for example you ran up the stairs or you're exercising and then you stop
the parasympathetic kicks in there and brings your pulse rate down and calms you down without that
everything would stay fairly elevated for a long period of time and in practice i used to measure
the parasympathetic nervous system i had a a test it's called heart rate variability which measures
the autonomic nervous system and when people would come in with very low parasympathetic function
if they were to exercise their pulse rate would go high and it just would not come down
so they have to do very very light things and not a lot of exercise all right number seven
magnesium decreases the sympathetic nervous system so this is the opposing nervous system
this is the nervous system that keeps things turned on and it keeps you from sleeping so
magnesium can chill that out and another name for the sympathetic nervous system is flight or fight
all right there you have it magnesium's effects on your mood before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

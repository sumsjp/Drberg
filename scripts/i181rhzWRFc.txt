i would highly recommend that you do fasting before
during and after surgery and especially after
some trauma or injury why is that because fasting creates some interesting
effects to help speed up the healing number one
we have a spike in ketones ketones are anti-inflammatory
they decrease certain things that raise inflammation
now what do you have when you have surgery trauma injury you have
inflammation you have pain fasting is one of the most powerful
things to decrease the pain and what that's going to do
decrease the need for medication the next thing
that's going to happen when you fast is it's going to stimulate
autophagy that's a condition where you recycle
damaged proteins as in ligaments tendons muscles after the
surgery trauma or injury so autophagy is very very important
post surgery post trauma etc also fasting will increase human growth
hormone and this is everything about growing
muscle and growing proteins but not just muscle
your cartilage the collagen the inside of the colon the skin
so anything that's protein can be improved by having a spike in human
growth hormone there's two surgeries that i had done
one is to my left shoulder and the other one is
to my left elbow my elbow was shattered in about 30
pieces so they had to do surgery problem was at
that point in my life i really didn't know much about fasting so i go
in the surgery okay i had the fast before i went in
surgery so i wasn't adapted to ketosis i was
literally starving to do the surgery and my blood sugars
just crashed why because i didn't adapt to
ketosis i didn't adapt to fat burning that well actually
i didn't adapt at all i had serious blood sugar issues
and then what they do is they bring you this little jello or crackers
there's no protein and i remember asking them
i can't eat this you need to give me some protein well we don't have any
protein i'm like nothing to go nope that's all we have
and so i i consumed it and then my blood sugars
really crashed down so i felt miserable now think about this
carbohydrates glucose are glucotoxic they create more
inflammation they create blood sugar issues so
if you're going to get surgery and you have the ability
to prepare for the surgery and i'm talking about
start intermittent fasting i would highly recommend
you do that two weeks before the surgery that way
you're fully adapted to fat burning and you can go into this
so smoothly without any problems with your blood sugars
and then i would recommend you do longer fasting right
after the surgery so you do intermittent fasting like two meals a day
before the surgery and then after you fast for at least 48 hours
i definitely do not agree with those that are recommending
carbo-loading after the operation because we're going to create more
inflammation it's much better if you do fasting because you get a lot of other
benefits now i'm not going to recommend just
drinking water when you're fasting i would recommend taking sea salt
probably a level teaspoon you can break it up and spread it through the day and
mix it in your water electrolytes i think it's going to be
very important potassium magnesium things like that and then b vitamins
okay for nutritional yeast that way if you had some deficiency going into a
fast it's not going to aggravate things one
more thing that might be helpful is to also take amino acids in a certain
blend that can help you in the recovery
there's a certain blend that i recommend i'm going to put a link down below
that won't turn into sugar or it won't create a lot of waste it has a rate of
replacing proteins and repairing things at 99
now if we compare that to eggs eggs would be like 48
the rest is either turning into glucose or
waste steak and fish i think it's like 38
and the worst protein to take is whey protein because the great majority of
that either turns into glucose or waste
and the last thing i would recommend is to take vitamin d
and at least 20,000 i use because vitamin d is a very powerful
anti-inflammatory so if we're going to combine
fasting with vitamin d we can actually really drop that inflammation
learn from my mistakes don't do what i did fast before you go into surgery
and then after and you're going to be fine thanks for watching

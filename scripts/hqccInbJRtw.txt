so this video is based on a question someone had about the mercury in tuna fish there's
certain types of tuna that are good and certain types that are not so good because
they contain three times as much mercury now the problem with mercury is it interferes with
certain enzymes involving selenium and certain fish have more selenium than others
and so the mercury that's in the environment it's in the water that the fish are exposed
to might not affect you too much if there's high amounts of selenium because selenium can counter
this mercury but you have to realize if there's too much mercury it can lock up these selenium
enzymes rendering them in active and this can create a whole series of mercury
toxic symptoms okay like tremors headaches nausea insomnia weak muscles twitches mood swings and
there's a lot of other symptoms as well and so if you want tuna that's lower in mercury
skipjack is a good source and canned light tuna now a better option would be to do the canned
salmon sockeye or the pink alaskan salmon or even wild called sardines but you want to avoid
the tuna that is higher mercury and that would be the albacore or the canned white tuna avoid that
and then avoid ahi tuna which is yellowfin in big eye because you're going to get three times
as much mercury now if your child is consuming tuna you want to really bring down the frequency
because really it's dose dependent so i would recommend your child consumes tuna maybe once
a month now there are certain cultures that consume dolphin or whale you have to realize
you're getting 20 times as much mercury as even the tuna in the higher category alright so this
was your short video regarding the mercury in tuna hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

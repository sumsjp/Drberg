Hi guys.
In this video, I want to talk about a tea that's been around for 5,000 years.
The chamomile tea.
It's really good for nervous tension, anxiety.
It's a calming type tea.
Great for muscle cramps.
Skin health, it's more effective than hydrocortisone cream for eczema.
It's quite amazing.
Digestive health, heartburn, IBS, gas, bloating.
Good for sleeping in general, so don't consume this right before a long road trip.
Because you might fall asleep.
Kidney stones, ulcers, gallstones.
Take one cup boiling water, add one teaspoon of this stuff and seep it for five to seven
minutes.
Now, if you want more of a calming effect, just leave it in there longer.
Alright?
Thank you so much for watching.

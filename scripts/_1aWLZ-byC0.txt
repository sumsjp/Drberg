i want to talk about how hysterectomy can
really destroy your body shape now this video is not just for women who had a hysterectomy
but it's primarily for women who are considering a hysterectomy you might want to think twice because
here's the problem when they do surgery there's all these ligaments that are attached to the
inside of your torso to the bottom part of the ribs to the lower back to the pelvis and when they
cut these ligaments and fascia which is a ligament it can create an imbalance because all these
ligaments are opposing your abdominal muscles so when you lose this stabilizing base it can create
major weaknesses within your abdominal muscles and then your stomach starts to collapse and
fall forward giving you more of a belly fat it can also create lower back pain because you lose the
low back curvature it can even actually spread your hips out a little bit more
it can create weaknesses in your core but other than that i think it's totally fine and i'm being
very sarcastic there's other side effects too that occur after you have a hysterectomy number one
you can lose your libido you can have bladder issues bowel issues even increase your risk
for cardiovascular disease and even clots because the imbalance in hormones if you had a
full hysterectomy when they took out the ovaries as well depression is a side effect weight gain
is a big side effects in fact the average a woman who gets a hysterectomy after one year
is weighing 25 pounds more also you can have pain and inflammation but there are also people that
have no symptoms at all so before you implement any of this information check with your doctor
i'm just giving you my opinion the two top reasons and there's other reasons why someone
would get a hysterectomy would be endometriosis and fibroids usually both of those conditions
occur because you're estrogen dominant and that means that you would want to avoid estrogen
like birth control pills also avoid gmo cotton did you realize that cotton is gmo
which means it has exposure to glyphosate herb which could mimic estrogen and create
problems so make sure your tampons were organic and also dairy i've always recommend if you do
dairy it must be organic but if you are estrogen dominant i would avoid dairy completely and other
things you need to avoid of course is soy and pretty much all of your foods should be organic
including your vegetables because pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides that are
on your food can mimic estrogen so we're trying to reverse that now there's two big things that
can help balance your estrogen and give you more good estrogen versus bad estrogen one
is consuming more cruciferous vegetables and two consuming seek help if you're going to
take a sea kelp tablet i always recommend only taking one per day you don't need much
but a little bit can be very very helpful now if you've already had the hysterectomy i hope you're
on the healthy version of keto i hope you're doing intermittent fasting both of those together are
going to be essential in supporting reduction of inflammation as well as leveraging your metabolism
to give you the best chance of losing weight so you can minimize the excess weight around
your midsection and if you do fasting periodic prolonged fasting your body will go through
what's called autophagy and will help recycle damaged proteins as in scar tissue and adhesions
that comes with surgery and the last thing i would recommend if you do have adhesions or scar tissue
which causes pain is tocatrinals it's a type of vitamin e that works very well on reducing
inflammation turning into fibroid adhesions thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

so is mct oil actually good or bad for your liver now i've done other videos talking about how bad
omega-6 fatty acids are for your liver because for example soy oil corn oil cottonseed oil canola are
all highly inflammatory and very very bad for a fatty liver omega-3 fatty acids on the other hand
like fish oil and cod olive oil are very good for a fatty liver but mct oil which stands for medium
chain triglycerides are a very unique type of fat that is actually very good for your liver and i'm
going to tell you why first of all mct fats are burned or oxidized into energy pretty quickly
and what's unique about mct oil being a fat is that it's water soluble now why is that
so significant because it doesn't depend on bile the stuff that's made by your liver that's stored
in the gallbladder so you don't need bio to break down mct oil in fact you do not need
enzymes from your pancreas to break down mct oil so it gets absorbed directly in the body
bypassing your digestive system so it goes right in the body it turns into ketones
and it's really good for dementia malabsorption issues that you have so if you have celiac or
scar tissue in your colon or some type of inflammatory condition in your gut this is a very
good fat to consume really good for brain problems especially epilepsy also good for heart conditions
and really good for people that actually don't have a gallbladder so if there's anything wrong
with your liver your bile ducts your gallbladder your pancreas your colon mct fats or oil is a very
good fat for those conditions now just so you know there's not a lot of vitamins in mct oil there's
not omega-3 fatty acids the primary benefits of mct oil is to provide energy primarily in the form
of ketones which by the way are anti-inflammatory they act as an antioxidant they carry more oxygen
with less waste as co2 and because so many people have digestive issues it's a very easy oil to
digest and if you haven't seen my other videos on mct oil i put them up right here check it out

so you definitely want to use fasting if you have pain especially chronic pain I
did another video on the topic of fasting with chronic inflammation and I
will put the link down below but the influence you can create when you do
fasting for chronic pain is huge this data was taken from several sources I'll
put the links down below one was doing a seven-day fast which is considered a
prolonged fast but you can also achieve these benefits from doing intermittent
fasting on a regular basis how would the avoidance of food actually help your
pain well you're gonna basically generate ketones ketones are alternative
fuel source that have antioxidant properties they have anti pain
properties they also protect the neurons that's why it's really good for dementia
and Parkinson's in Alzheimer's but it's also good for peripheral neuropathies
where you have tingling or nerve pain in your hands or your feet from the damage
that is created from diabetes or other things number two fasting can release
and help you recycle a lot of serotonin serotonin is typically involved in your
mood it'll bring you up it will give you the sense of well-being it also helps
you sleep but it has another important function in reducing neuropathic pain
which is basically pain from nerve damage it can also reduce fibromyalgia
which is a pain involved in a lot of different muscle groups low serotonin
can actually cause chronic pain and people in chronic pain usually always
have low amounts of serotonin raising serotonin alone can dramatically reduce
pain serotonin is a neurotransmitter and another cool thing about fasting is it
has the ability to increase neurotransmitter receptors in general so
it's not just about serotonin it'll increase the receptors the ability for
that neurotransmitter to be absorbed in the body with different
neurotransmitters like adrenaline noradrenaline
dopamine things like that alright number three fasting stimulates neurogenesis
what is that well neurogenesis is there regrowing of
neurons or nerve cells if you have nerve damage it's causing pain and you have
more ability to grow that nerve then your pain is going to go away a lot
faster it stimulates stem cells that help you grow new neurons and that's
part of number six fasting increases brain derived
neurotrophic factor and you can look at this like Miracle Grow for your brain it
just allows the brain to grow back much better if there's damage and lastly
fasting increases endorphins which will not only increase your mood and make you
feel better but it will also decrease your pain now
if we look at the flip side of fasting and we look at frequent eating or
overeating or consuming carbs in general what is that - that creates a tremendous
amount of oxidation and your vascular system and the capillaries that feed the
nerves this is why diabetics for example that have high amounts of sugar end up
having all sorts of nerve damage because it destroys the circulation to the
nervous system they have pain syndromes they have problems with the retina which
is a nerve we know that problems blood sugars can
occur from a lot of carbohydrates or doing a lot of frequent meals with a lot
of snacking or grazing in between so if we just flip it and do the opposite and
fast and not eat so frequently we can get rid of the pain pretty naturally if
you haven't seen my video on fasting and chronic inflammation I put it up right

so your immune system is highly influenced by your sleep cycles so if
you're not sleeping your immune system is just not going to work so let's talk
about why that is well when you sleep you stimulate growth hormone growth
hormone is intimately involved with proteins and your entire immune system
is made out of proteins you're going to have higher cortisol and adrenaline and
both of these if spiked chronically will suppress your immune system the rhythm
of sleep is called circadian waves the strength of your macrophages are highly
dependent on your sleep cycles and these guys are professional phagocytes they
basically go in there and they eat up microbes macrophages are not just a
garbage disposal that cleans up debris but they will eat viruses bacteria
they're like your guards that protect you against invaders also your t-cells
which has to do with thymus the thymus trains your immune system t-cells to do
their job so we have the t-cells and then we have cytokines which could be
inflammatory anti-inflammatory but they're basically the communications
between your immune cells so certain t-cells and cytokines will peak right
when you start to get to sleep then others will peak during the day like the
killer T cells which would be equivalent to the Navy SEALs so when you don't get
sleep and you're tired during the day these cells can't protect you so you're
more susceptible to getting an infection and also the speed at which the white
blood cells are fighting infection will be suppressed and then we also have the
memory of your immune function as well will be suppressed so if you can't
remember certain pathogens and you can't fight infection you're just more
susceptible to getting sick so if you want to strengthen your immune system
get more sleep by watching this video right here

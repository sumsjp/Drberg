hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the absolute most important vitamin
involved in diabetes that would be vitamin b1 okay vitamin b1 does a lot of things but related
to diabetes it is involved in keeping the lining of the blood vessels nice and strong without b1
you have a problem with the vascular system the blood vessels okay now realize that the
blood vessels support the nervous system your nerves need blood flow there are tiny nerves
in the cornea of your eye the retinal nerve that goes in the back of the eye that goes
to the brain that's nerve both of those nerves are supplied by blood vessels when you consume
a lot of sugar or you're diabetic and you have high sugar you get a severe b1 deficiency 75%
of diabetics type 1 and 2 are deficient in B vitamins okay primarily the b1 but other
B vitamins as well so when you don't get blood supply to the nerve it decreases the oxygen to
the nervous system and then you start getting all sorts of problems with that so vitamin b1
deficiencies affect the nervous system and the heart first especially the nerves that
connect to the heart it affects also affects the mammillary bodies in the brain they're
these little structure in the brain called the mammillary bodies that are like really switches
to your memory system so that's why when your vitamin b1 deficient your memories start going
as well vitamin b1 is also involved in making myelin which is the insulation around the nerve
so when you're deficient in b12 lose the myelin sheath you can't grow that anymore and that's
where you start getting pain in the feet in the hand first because those are the distal
or the furthest nerves from the heart okay that's where it shows up first because it's a nutritional
deficiency so vitamin b1 counters damage to the vascular walls that support the nervous system
it also prevents necrosis that's like dead and dying tissue so you know with diabetics
you lose it your toes right well b1 will prevent that number three b1 improves the neurovascular
system that's the connection between the nerves and the vascular system together b1 increases
the survival of heart cells as well because it affects the nervous system in the heart number
five b1 prevents cardiac fibrosis that's like scar tissue filling up the heart b1 prevents diabetic
retinopathy that's damage to the retina of the eye it also prevents neuropathy which is damage
to the nervous system now you would think this to be in the front of every newspaper in United
States but it's buried you have to dig it out I'm going to put a link down below you have to read
this this research study on this vitamin because it's incredible every diabetic should be taking
this so just make sure when you get b1 give it in 600 milligrams and make sure it's a fat soluble
form not the typical thiamine in the water soluble form thanks for watching hey you probably already
subscribed but if you haven't press this little button down below and I will keep you updated

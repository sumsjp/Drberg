let's talk about how to raise your mood this is primarily for
men um but there's a great study i put the link down below called
efficiency of fasting and calorie restriction on mood and
depression among aging men so there was 32 men in
this study an average age of 59 and they did this
for three months they did a combination of low calorie
and also fasting and the results were remarkable
there was significant improvement in less tension
less anger less confusion that's wild increase vigor
and increase daytime concentration not to mention other benefits like weight
loss so there's this condition called peds
partial endocrine deficiency syndrome it's really just a syndrome that occurs
in men as they age where the endocrine
system kind of falls apart and the hormones get
lower and lower and lower primarily we have two hormones involved
we have testosterone and cortisol so we have the spike in cortisol the
stress hormone with a drop in testosterone
and by the way when you increase cortisol you do
drop testosterone so when you have this situation right here which
starts to happen at age 50 and it gets worse with time a lot of
times men will do testosterone replacement therapy
and what they might not realize is that even though it might help them in the
short term it will basically stop the production
of this hormone in the pituitary called luteinizing hormone
and then that will cause atrophy of the gonads
because when you're taking hormone your body's own
production doesn't have to work and you basically shut down your own production
of testosterone so it comes with a package and i don't
think it's the best solution there are other things that you
can do that are very very powerful number one
fasting if you're new to this channel and you haven't tried fasting
and you're a man over the age of 50 and you have any of the symptoms with
lower testosterone or high cortisol whether it's mood changes
cognitive changes loss of muscle mass lack of sex drive uh ed
other issues then fasting can greatly help you and i'll put a link
down below of how to do this correctly zinc is another very important trace
mineral that can help enhance testosterone
and lower cortisol at the exact same time
and number three l-arginine l-arginine is a pretty inexpensive non-essential
amino acid that has the ability to increase growth
hormone increase testosterone and it also
increases something called nitric oxide which can
help erectile dysfunction and lower blood
pressure and help blood flow to the brain so this
one actually is really important in men as they get
older and then exercise in general and then of course i'm just assuming you
know about healthy keto you would want to add that as well then
you'd have a really good combination to pull yourself out of any lower mood
situation that you have and help to reverse this right here if
you want these benefits right here simply do these things right here
before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

this is a very interesting topic
and i put the study down below but
there's been a study that showed that
stevia using the whole leaf
has the ability to kill
the pathogen that causes
lyme disease i mean this is huge
now lyme disease is caused by a spiral
kite
spirochite is a spiral bacteria
that you get infected from a tick
and not everyone gets lyme disease
certain people that have a lowered
immune system get lyme disease and by
the way if you have the bullseye rash it
doesn't always mean that you have
limes but antibiotics are the primary
treatment for lyme the problem is they
don't always work in fact 20 of the time
you develop a resistance to the
antibiotic
and the problem is when you come off the
antibiotic
things get worse you relapse so
sometimes you have to stay in the
antibiotics for a very very long time
now this microbe has been around for
eons and has developed defense
mechanisms to survive and so if your
immune system is healthy it'll go in
your body
and it'll go into a dormant state
sometimes as a biofilm which are like
little igloos of calcium little houses
that they live in that
that allow them to live under the radar
so your immune system cannot see them
and so they go dormant for years
waiting until a desirable environment
occurs
they're waiting until you get stressed
out
until you get older
sickly where your immune system is shot
then they come out and kick you when
you're down but in the study stevia
compared to three different antibiotics
showed a significant effect compared to
these antibiotics also stereo was able
to eliminate the spirochite as well as
the biofilms now i will say this was not
in a human study yet but
this is very promising so
it wouldn't hurt to try it if you have
limes now because the problem is when
you take an antibiotic
antibiotics increase biofilms
they lower your immune system so there
are many things you can take to help
combat lyme as far as natural remedies
and i've done videos on that
but let's add stevia to the list
so if you're enjoying my content which i

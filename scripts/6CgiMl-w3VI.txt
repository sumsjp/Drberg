let's talk about the difference between salmon and Cod and which one is truly
healthier the first thing I want to mention is that when you consume salmon
or Cod make sure that it's wild-caught not farm-raised there's been this
thought that you should consume more Cod because of some thought that consuming
fatty fish is going to clog your arteries which is completely not true at
all let's just do a little comparison three ounces of salmon versus Cod salmon
it will give you about twenty five point four grams of protein cod will give you
twenty two point eight grams there's 1.2 grams of saturated fat and salmon and
there's a lot less it just traces trace amounts of fat in the cod fish starting
with vitamins b3 if we take three ounces of the fish that will satisfy 45% of
your RDAs for salmon and only 10% for cod b12 45 percent versus 15 percent b6
45 percent versus 10 percent B to 25 percent versus only 4% b1 15 percent
versus 6 percent so you can see that salmon has a lot more B vitamins folate
six percent versus two percent now both of these fish do have a little bit of
mercury but you don't have to be concerned because they also have a good
amount of selenium about equal and selenium is used by your body for
certain enzymes to counter the toxic effect of mercury but check out this big
difference here salmon has two thousand two hundred eight milligrams of omega-3
fatty acids versus cod which only has a hundred and seventy one milligrams so
you can see right there salmon is definitely the winner now a lot of
people consume cod as a like a fish and chips type thing where it's deep-fried
it's usually farm raised fish not that healthy I also recommend if you're going
to consume fish to consume the skin on it there's a lot of benefits from the
skin and the fat that's just underneath the skin all right guys

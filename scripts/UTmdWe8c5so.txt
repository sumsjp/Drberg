Hey guys, I'm back and today we're going to do an FAQ on this product right here
called trace minerals enhanced now I did have a product in the past that was a
liquid but there are two problems with that product one is when you ship a
liquid sometimes it leaks and it can get very very messy and the other reason I
wanted to change the formula is because I wanted to add some additional trace
minerals to this product to make it even better
and the most important trace mineral that I wanted to add in higher amounts
was this one right here zinc and one thing that people might not realize when
you're you're taking a zinc product is that if you're taking one trace mineral
or one mineral over a long period of time without the other minerals with it
it can deplete and create an imbalance in the other minerals especially with
copper, so I added zinc with some other key trace minerals in a blend of all of
the trace minerals and there's over 74 different trace minerals just to make
sure we don't create additional deficiencies but zinc supports a healthy
immune system in fact your phagocytes the cells that eat viruses and bacteria
and dead cells are saturated with zinc so if your zinc deficient you become
more susceptible to infection because you lose that resistance also you need
zinc for vitamin A to be utilized in the body so let's say for example you're
driving at night and it's raining it's hard to see at night so you have problem
with night vision well that's usually a vitamin A deficiency but if you're
deficient in zinc vitamin A won't work also zinc is involved in epithelial
tissue integrity so all the inner skin inside your sinuses all the way down to
the colon have this inner lining of skin it's called epithelial tissue and zinc
is involved in keeping the integrity of that tissue to prevent leaky gut which
leads to all sorts of immune issues so zinc is involved in a lot of different
things including your skin both outside and inside reproduction immune system it
supports testosterone and it's very high in oysters shellfish
red meat and even cheese now there's a couple of reasons why a lot of people
are deficient in zinc number one we don't have a good storage system for
zinc so if we're not consuming zinc on a regular basis from our food we become
deficient number two if you're consuming grains corn or rice there's something in
there called phytic acid that blocks your absorption of zinc also the more
stress you're under the more sugar you eat the more deficient you are in zinc
all right the next one is manganese manganese is really important in
strengthening ligaments okay in your back in your feet if your mother is
deficient in manganese when she's pregnant with you you can have all sorts
of structural problems because the ligaments will become lacks potentially
you could even have flat feet and many other structural problems because
manganese is involved in bone formation cartilage different enzymes and even the
immune system and then we get to copper copper is one little part of the vitamin
C complex so if you've ever heard of a major vitamin C deficiency called scurvy
you'll notice that there's a major loss of collagen they have major fatigue
copper is part of the vitamin C complex and it comes in a certain enzyme that's
involved in making collagen it's also involved in supporting healthy immune
system and like I said before ligaments and it works with zinc together as a
kind of a teeter-totter if you have too much of one thing it'll deplete the
other and then we get iodine iodine supports a healthy thyroid it helps in
the formation of thyroid hormones so if you've heard of t4 or t3 the three
and four represent the number of iodine molecules in that thyroid hormone it
also helps support estrogen and helps to balance out estrogen so if you have too
much estrogen iodine can help bring it back into the right
range iodine is very very very important if a mother who's pregnant is
carrying their child because if the mother is deficient that child could end
up with a lower IQ and certain cognitive impairments and then we get to selenium
which is probably one of the most important antioxidants it's involved in
something called glutathione which is a very powerful antioxidant in your liver
it's also very important in converting the thyroid hormones like t4 to t3 it's
really important in supporting conditions like Hashimoto's it's also
very helpful in buffering excess amounts of mercury it's involved in the immune
system it also can prevent muscle cramping so let's say you're doing all
of the different minerals like magnesium potassium salt and you still have cramps
it could be you need selenium selenium is mainly in shellfish and seafood okay
boron boron is very important to supporting bone health it's also
involved in building this hormone testosterone and a lot of people take it
for pain like in the knee of the shoulder so it does tend to help reduce
pain in some patients okay chromium very important in blood sugars
okay it supports the cells that make insulin and a lot of people have insulin
resistance have a deficiency of chromium chromium is also involved in stabilizing
your mood and helping reduce your stress and then we have molybdenum okay this
is involved in the detoxification process let's say for example you have a
candida infection you have died off from that also it helps detoxify sulfites and
potentially could help lower uric acid so this product has greater amounts of
these trace minerals but it's also in a blend of all of the trace minerals so
trace minerals in general are minerals needed in very small amounts but they
are cofactors in the biochemistry of the body so you have all these different
enzymes that are proteins that are building tissue
breaking food down all the different chemical reactions trace minerals are
needed in those chemical reactions they're in fact very essential without
them the chemistry would not work I would recommend taking one to two per
day on an empty stomach to get the most absorption possible so if you want to
check it out I put the link down below

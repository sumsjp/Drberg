a technology called synchronization
breathing technology now what the heck
does that mean that is a technology of
getting your breath breathing in at a
certain rate and letting it out at a
certain rate and is backed up by
hardcore science it's not some new agey
type thing you're going to go meditate
in somewhere and try to focus on
something you're basically all you're
doing is you're getting your breath down
to a certain frequency a certain
wavelength to reduce and extract stress
from your body to dissolve the stress
that's built up through the day and
every night you're going to play this
software and you're going to play it and
you're going to breathe with it and
you're it's going to retrain your
nervous system and your body to be calm
so you can get into deeper sleep and
wake up feeling refreshed it's quite
amazing actually and so the breath is
five seconds in with one pause
out I mean just one pause and then five
seconds out with one pause so it's a six
second breathe in six seconds breathe
out and that's I think that comes to
five breaths per minute if I if I know
my math correct correctly so you're
gonna do this breathing every night so
I'm gonna just give you give you some
tips on this
um when you turn it on you have this
little um this leaf that will open up
and then close okay that would be uh
symbolic of your lungs so you're going
to breathe breathe with it like this
[Music]
um
now if you notice
I'm not using Force I'm not going
you want to use the least amount of
force you want to breathe in
pause okay and you want to breathe in
through your your stomach so when you
breathe in you don't want to be a chest
breather where you're
and breathe in the stomach
don't breathe in with your chest breathe
in
out now when you're stressed your
exhalation becomes shorter than your
inhalation so the when you actually
breathe in you add a little bit of
stress into the body when you breathe
out you release a little stress in your
body when you're stressed
the inhalation is a certain amount but
the exhalation is usually half or
shorter than your inhalation and you're
not allowing all the CO2 carbon dioxide
to come out of your blood so you
actually you starve your body of oxygen
that's why walking is so good for stress
see when you when you exercise you
actually are stressing your body but
you're getting oxygen with it
when you're stressed and you're not
exercising it's like you're adding
stress without oxygen and it's more
destructive to the body
so this breathing software allows you to
literally extract your stress every
night and train your nervous system to
breathe correctly and that will be five
breaths a minute
okay so I want you to practice this
so once you're in the site
click on this button here called stress
tool
and here you are this is called the
synchronization reading software
biofeedback tool and you're going to
click on start
after counting down it's going to allow
you to synchronize your breath at five
seconds in and five seconds out with the
one second pause in between this happens
to be the pattern of Maximum relaxation
for your nervous system and maximum
training of your nervous system
so you can get into the deepest sleep
possible I recommend doing this about 5
10 20 minutes each night after a long
day of stress
so go ahead and do this and I will talk
to you in a couple days

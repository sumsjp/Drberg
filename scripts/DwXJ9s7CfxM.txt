hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the
secret to fixing low testosterone okay now you ready for the secret are you
ready for this are you sitting now so it's not about
necessarily trying to boost your testosterone that's not it
out of all the things that you can do it's really the avoidance of something
that will improve testosterone and so first thing we're talking about is the
symptoms and then I'm going to get into the things that you can do to boost it
but then I'm going to talk about that three things you need to pay attention
to to avoid so you can really get your testosterone back okay so first of all
let's talk about the symptoms decreased libido decrease erections decreased
vitality you're starting to gain some weight around the midsection and you
cannot build muscle mass so you go work out the muscle is not coming back or not
getting bigger okay that's all signs of deficiency and testosterone and what's
interesting is you get older in your 40s and 50s and 60s testosterone starts
going down down down down down okay in a female body it goes up so everything is
reversed right so now let's talk about the triggers so it is true yeah you can
take zinc from seafood and beef and lamb and sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds you
can do that okay and you can take vitamin D and vitamin D actually is from
the Sun or you can do take it from cod liver oil and the only vegetarian
vegetation a vegetarian source would be mushrooms and then vitamin A from cod
liver oil and then resisted exercise all those are really good to trigger
testosterone but it doesn't make a huge impact as compared to avoiding these
three things I'm going to talk about next okay so there are three hormones
that in the presence of these hormones testosterone is going to plummet okay
number one is insulin okay this regulates blood sugars number
two estrogen when estrogen goes up testosterone goes down and three is
cortisol when cortisol goes up testosterone goes down alright
so out of these three yes insulin will do it cortisol will do
it but the most important thing that you need to focus on is your estrogen levels
because if that estrogen is too high and it's very very common because as you get
older especially in a male body the estrogen goes up and your testosterone
goes down so you notice your voice starts getting higher the skin starts
getting thinner and softer that's estrogen okay so real quick I put
some links down below of how to fix like if you have problems with insulin
resistance and what to avoid with that you know definitely in a minute fasting
and cutting out sugars and things so that's I don't want to put a tension on
that because I want to focus more on the estrogens but you want to handle the
insulin and then cortisol cortisol is all about getting rid of stress and hand
in hint enhancing your sleep and getting to you're getting a good adrenal gland
function okay so now let's just put some attention on this estrogen now the
single biggest source of hidden estrogen in in your diet is basically from
consuming animal products not because the animals are injected with estrogen
it's because this animal feed so they give them soy unless it's
grass-fed they're giving a grain and now it's kind of laughs when you see on the
label it's like oh yeah this uh these eggs or our vegetarian fed all that
means is we're giving them soy and corn okay both of them are GMO so not only
does that increase estrogen because you have it's filled with pesticides like
you know herbicides and Roundup Ready but the biggest thing is the soy feed
that's fed to the chickens and the cattle that's the thing that's messing
people up so there's even an organization now that's trying to
monitor that but if they haven't really got too far because it's very political
but if you're going to consume animal products is better be grass-fed and
definitely organic because this is estrogen effect and so also if you have
some extra fat in your body right now there's an enzyme called aroma taste
that basically is in your fat and that's converting the
last bit of testosterone you have to estrogen so your own body is making more
estrogen not to mention the animal products and everything else so I want
to give you some things to do to actually clean up the estrogen this
whole estrogen problem is really in the liver so we want to make sure the liver
is really really good so there's the top foods that you should be eating right
now to lower your estrogen and their anti-estrogenic and they will also
inhibit this enzyme our cruciferous vegetables and you probably heard that
before kale broccoli Brussels sprouts and do a
shake of kale beet leaves and parsley because parsley is a really good anti
estrogenic vegetable as well so you do that olive oil is very anti extra genic
celery is very anti estrogenic mushrooms have a very high anta estrogenic just
regular those little button mushrooms you can just start consuming those women
in a study with women that consumed I think was like eight ounces of mushrooms
they decrease their breast cancer by 50% so it's pretty significant so we want to
start changing the diet and start to improve in the liver the other thing
that will increase the estrogen in addition to the animal feeds and is any
type of soy in the diet soy protein isolates I mean soils in so
many foods it's just very very estrogenic and 95 percent of it is GMO
the last thing i want to talk about is another hidden source of estrogen is
alcohol okay alcohol it's very estrogenic too
and and the problem with men is they start getting man boobs they start
getting prostate problems because of the estrogen effect okay so I just wanted to
put your attention on the most important thing to put your attention on if you
have low tea it's this little guy right here start cleaning up the liver start
adding more vegetables to start getting this estrogen out change your diet go to
grass-fed and thank you so much for watching

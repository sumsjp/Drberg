hey guys dr. Berg here I want to answer a question off my website relating to
the dangers of cardiovascular problems if you're not sleeping and if you're
exercising okay now the answer to that question relates to chapter 14 where I
talked about exercising for your body type okay and there's two things to this
answer number one you know if you ask anyone is exercise good for the heart
they're going to say oh yes it decreased risk of heart attacks okay but here's
the thing if you combine high exercise high intensity exercise or a
long-distance type exercise with insomnia sleep apnea okay you are going
to dramatically spike your risk for heart attacks alright why because when
you're tired the body the cardiovascular system is very very messed up if you
ever looked at a graph of a heart when you're tired it's it's actually very
very weak okay so sleeping really improves the cardiovascular function
because the heart has to beat all the time so it needs to heal when it sleeps
right so if you're not sleeping your heart is under stress okay now if we add
another layer of exercise on top of that it's not going to be a pretty picture
your risk for a heart attack will spike okay
so here's what you need to do use this principle to adjust your workouts
based on your energy level in your sleep okay so if you can sleep good and you
have a lot of energy then go for it do a high exercise intensity type workout but
if you're not sleeping the only exercise that you should do is either yoga
walking or pilates nothing high intensity because you're going to put
your heart at risk and I only see these people trying desperately to lose weight
and they're at the gym at 4 o'clock in the morning they haven't slept and
they're pushing trying to burn off these calories and first of all they're not
going to lose weight okay secondly they're going to create a lot
of chest problems the symptom of heart problems is tension
on the upper right back on your mid-back right to the left side or the left
shoulder okay also having a tired heart will then
prevent you from sleeping so the point is that you must fix the sleep you know
I have a you can try my adrenal night formula you can try other sleeping type
remedies but make sure that they don't have another tonin make sure they're
natural okay use the acupressure on the adrenals there's many things you can do
to help to sleep but never ever ever do any type of long-distance exercise or
high-intensity if you have not slept okay so go ahead and apply that and I
will see you in the next video

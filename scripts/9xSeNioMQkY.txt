did you realize that chronic stress destroys your ability
to experience pleasure now when you experience
short-term stress your cortisol spikes and there's a hormone called dopamine
that will increase initially dopamine is involved
with pleasure and in this case it can act as
a protective counter effect from the stress when you
go through stress over a long period of time you're
constantly triggering dopamine to the point where the receptors for dopamine
start downgrading to the point where it doesn't work
anymore and the same thing happens with chronic consumption of sugar drugs
certain medications will do the same thing with stress and high cortisol over
a long period of time you may notice that it's more difficult
to experience pleasure you're less motivated you're less awake
or an alert and you basically just have more stress because there's no
more counter hormone to kind of buffer that
what can you do about that let's give you a couple things to do number one
you need to get more sleep a lot more sleep sleep is one of the best things to
counter stress if you can't sleep the whole
night then try to figure out a way that you
can take a nap through the day but it's the volume of sleep that can
really help you counter stress just lack of sleep in general will keep
your cortisol elevated number two decrease
fear in your life the number one thing to do is stop
watching the news in fact i had an idea i wanted to do a clinical experiment
with a number of people to document this because i know this is true and evaluate
someone's cortisol levels dopamine levels
the immune system from just two weeks of watching the news regular news right
then to compare that with a group of people that watch
no news whatsoever i will guarantee there will be significant changes and
improvement just by not watching the news for two
weeks in fact you should just try this right now
stop watching the news for two to three days
and just see how you feel and then go back to watch the news and see how you
feel then you can decide what will be the
better thing to do number three exercise will give you more oxygen it
reduces stress get out nature more go for walks hikes
in nature it's a huge therapy and you already know that but i'm just
making note of this and number four isolate the source of your stress what
is the number one source of stress in your life go ahead and type it down
in the comments section right now now what you do is you attack the source
of that stress do whatever you can to eliminate
that stress or at least reduce it now if you're in a situation where
you're stuck between a rock and a hard place where you can't do
anything about it find a part of that stress
situation that you can do something about and do something about it
and then when the stress gets better you find another part of that stress that
you can do something about handle that until it's manageable if you
haven't seen my stress webinar that's a really important one i
put it up right here check it out

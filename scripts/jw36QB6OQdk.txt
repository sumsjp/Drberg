i wanted to do this quick video on the
interesting benefits of applying
caffeine to your skin
now the question is can't you just drink
coffee and get enough caffeine to help
your skin well no that doesn't really
work there's certain topical benefits of
caffeine that you can't get by drinking
caffeine now of course you can always
overdo it
so i'm not talking about putting a
tremendous amount on your skin but just
enough to create some interesting
effects now as far as the type of
caffeine you can use coffee grounds
you can use caffeine creams
or you can use green tea or a
combination of green tea and coffee
which i do recommend because there's so
many different phytonutrients in coffee
and green tea including
the compound egcg which has incredible
benefits you probably have seen many
different
facial creams with green tea extract and
even caffeine but caffeine has
interesting properties to the skin
it can act as a potent antioxidant it
can actually reduce inflammation now
using topical caffeine on the skin
doesn't always work on every single
condition like for example it may reduce
some redness with acne but it doesn't
get rid of acne there's other solutions
for that
it can maybe help with hair loss that
tiny bit but not significantly but what
it can do is give you some temporary
help on the three conditions i want to
talk about
as you work to correct the underlying
cause and i always recommend that number
one you can potentially reduce
cellulite okay the appearance of
cellulite
which occurs when you have
changes in your fat cells as well as a
connective tissue with cellulite you
have a loss of collagen and loss of
muscle you have atrophy
and it creates like kind of an orange
peel effect
but caffeine directly on the skin
increases lipolysis the breakdown of fat
it increases microvascular circulation
so it gets more blood flow more lymph
flow because it has vasoconstrictive
properties so it will tighten the skin
and you probably noticed a dramatic
difference within minutes but just
realize it's a temporary solution but
there are some important things you can
do that can create a significant
difference but it takes time but in the
meantime
this might help you number two aging
spots
sun spots
spots that develop from uv radiation
basically anything that creates hyper
pigmentation on the skin okay
caffeine can help you and number three
puffiness under your eyes okay now
if you have dark circles underneath the
eye that's probably not the best
solution but there's puffiness that
would be a good temporary solution but
i will tell you if your eyes are puffy
that
means you are consuming too many
carbohydrates that's like a suretel sign
that your carbs are way too high and if
you just got on a ketogenic diet with
some fasting this would go away
permanently now i recently did a video
on this hyperpigmentation on the skin
and talked about why some people get
these spots yet other people don't it
really has to do with
the level of antioxidants in your skin
but i think the next most important
video for you to watch would be the one
on cellulite so check that one out i put
it up right here

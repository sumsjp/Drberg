hey guys dr. Berg here I have a question for you are your sport drinks causing dehydration
and weight gain yeah this is interesting you know you have this idea that you're drinking
the sports drink and you're gonna hydrate your body and it's gonna help your performance but
in fact if you look at some of the studies it doesn't really help your performance and check
down below I put some of the studies down below primarily because most of these sport drinks
or electrolyte drinks have so much sugar okay not just Gatorade and by the way Gatorade has
36 grams of sugar that's nine teaspoons of sugar it's like drinking a soda so the sugar dehydrates
you why because it depletes minerals and if you take a diabetic for example that has higher sugar
they're peeing a lot and they're becoming more dehydrated so this idea that we need glucose I
think people have this confusion that when they work out because they're using up their glycogen
Reserve or their sugar reserve that they need to put the sugar back well when you put it in a
refined state like pure sugar or high fructose corn syrup or any type of synthetic sugars you
will deplete potassium magnesium chromium all the key minerals to help you lower insulin okay
so so we have the dehydration dehydration part but now the other part I want to talk about is
that here you are trying to lose weight right you're trying to exercise to lose weight well
sport drinks nullify the benefits from exercise because it's going to raise up your insulin and
it's going to block fat-burning so anytime you consume sugar you could trigger insulin
block fat burning and then anything extra is converted to fat okay not to mention the sugar
making you tired so when you drink this drink and then you feel this little spike in energy
and then it's gonna come down it's gonna come crashing down because insulin will be generated
and then you can end up lowering your blood sugar so you end up with a high sugar and a
low sugar okay so I just wanted to kind of dispel the myth that that's going to really
improve your performance and hydrate you when in fact it's not really doing that so next time
you get an electrolyte drink and make sure it doesn't have the sugar thanks for watching

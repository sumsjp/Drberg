all right so i have some good news for you and i have some bad news what do you want to hear first
the good news or the bad news let's start with the bad news okay the bad news is this air pollution
has now been found to cause diabetes okay and it has to do with this thing called particulate
matter that is the microscopic particles in the air you have solids you have liquids
and they're very very tiny they can get into the lungs they can go into your blood
and create all sorts of problems now the size of this particulate matter
is less than 2.5 micrometers now a micrometer is a micron and it's a million times less than an
actual meter so it's very very tiny and usually you can see this as haze in the air
now in this particulate matter you have hundreds of different chemicals from industry
from power plants and automobiles and various other things that get into the air and one
problem is that can cause lung cancer but a new study that came out it was 16 weeks long showed
that exposure to particular matter and they call it pm 2.5 which is particular matter less than 2.5
microns they found that it altered blood sugars and increased the risk of diabetes significantly
and they're not sure exactly why this is but there's some theories could be because of the
systemic inflammation it could be because the autonomic nervous system dysfunction
could be the oxidative stress or it could just be affecting the gut microbiome but all this leads to
insulin resistance so it affects the blood sugars and insulin resistance is a precursor to diabetes
all right that's the bad news let's talk about the good news they also found out
that fasting completely blocks this effect okay and i'll put the link down below so if you're
doing fasting you're protected against this negative effect fasting blocks this problem
turning into insulin resistance it also inhibits glucose and tolerance simply because of all the
hundreds of powerful benefits from fasting and one being a strengthened immune system another being
autophagy which cleans up the body and probably the biggest benefit is the increased resistance
against oxidative stress so especially if you live in a polluted environment
you need to do fasting i put a link down below of exactly how to do it it's pretty easy and i'll
walk you through how to do it step by step hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

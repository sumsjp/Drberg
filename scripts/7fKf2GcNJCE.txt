let's talk about the best vitamin for emotional instability
now there are other causes of emotional instability
that have nothing to do with your nutrition i'm going to talk about the
nutrient connection to your emotions it's a deficiency of vitamin b1
if you're deficient in b1 you may experience emotional instability
and delirium what is that it's mental confusion
and emotional disruption which also occurs frequently
when an alcoholic is going through withdrawal symptoms or even
a drug addict goes through these withdrawal symptoms
now there are certain specific parts of your brain
that require vitamin b1 here they are the hippocampus which has
a lot to do with your memory and also like a relay switch
with your emotions the amygdala which has a lot to do
with stress responses very similar to the adrenal but in your brain needs b1
because of course stress depletes b1 and the mammillary bodies
which are two structures in the brain which not only can influence
emotions but also spatial memory your ability to remember
where locations are in time and space so let's say for example you have a hard
time finding some location because you don't have a gps
you don't have a map and someone told you where to go and you're like i'm not
sure how to get there that's a problem with the mamillary body
so these three structures need a lot of b1 to function
another interesting thing is when you electrically stimulate nerves within
these structures they give off a high rate of vitamin b1
80 times more than resting nerves the more that you're using these
structures the more b1 is necessary the RDAs
for b1 is only 2 milligrams b1 is water-soluble so you don't really
store a lot of it and your body needs a small amount of it
but it needs it consistently so if you're consuming a lot of glucose
or you go through a lot of stress or a lot of refined foods
or even chlorine that can also deplete your
b1 now your b1 needs also depend on the amount of carbohydrates the more
carbohydrates the more sugar you're consuming the more b1 that you're
going to need now what's really wild is like potassium
you need 4700 milligrams
and b1 you only need two milligrams so again you don't need much but you need
it consistently other symptoms that a b1 deficiency will
create would be irritability depression
anxiety confusion memory loss lack of initiative poor ability to learn
and poor concentration the best source of b1 is nutritional yeast
if you're going to buy a b1 supplement i highly recommend you don't buy a
synthetic version you get a natural version but if you get
an unfortified or unenriched nutritional yeast that
will have enough b1 all right thanks for watching

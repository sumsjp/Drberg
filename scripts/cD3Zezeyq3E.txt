okay let's talk about juicing while you're doing keto or while you're
doing fasting is it okay is it not okay now if you're doing keto
or intermittent fasting you're just not seeing results that you would like
or you have some type of problem with that let's say for example you just have
cravings like crazy well then we have to evaluate
what you are eating during the fast and what you're eating when you're doing
keto so typically when you fast you shouldn't be eating anything
except you're drinking water but i recommend doing supplements
i don't recommend doing any juice at all on occasion
if you're doing a prolonged fast i think it's okay to do the whole
vegetable let's say you're doing celery or maybe even kale because you're having
the fiber but not necessarily just the juice
because the phytonutrients in these vegetables can actually help
enhance the benefit of your intermittent fasting but when it
comes down to juicing here's a couple things you need to know
let's say for example you were to juice celery and i'm going to take one cup for
each one of these now if you're from some european country
like germany for example and you are not using cups as your measurements
you're going to have to look them up and specifically i'm talking to the
gentleman named dennis who asks who brought up the point i should have
my own conversion tables but in this video
you're going to have to do your own conversions dennis okay
all right so take a look at this celery one cup
3.5 grams of carbs okay so now we have carrots
9.5 grams of carbs and then kale 6.7 grams of carbs so you can see
carrots have the most carbs now you're not consuming
the fiber so you can't deduct the fiber from the total carbs let me explain what
i'm talking about normally what you would do if you were
going to consume celery or carrot or kale
is you take the total carb and minus the fiber
because even though the fiber is a carb you don't count it into your
calculations you deduct it and you get the net carb
and this is the figure that you're looking at
if you're consuming the fiber with it the whole thing
but because we're juicing we don't get to calculate
in this fiber part right here we don't get to
minus it so if we take a look at the celery which is pretty low and
carrot is pretty high 9.5 grams of carbs but realize we're
taking a cup of carrots and we're juicing it which we're going
to get a lot less than that cup probably just going to get
a small amount because we're going to take all the fiber away from it so
but i'm just using this as a kind of a standard example so if you're going to
juice you're probably going to get more than
9.5 grams but the point is that i wanted to show
you the difference between these net carbs if you consume the whole
thing look at that 1.9 grams it's pretty low
this is totally fine carrot six grams it's a little too high
and then kale which is surprising you would think it
would have a lot more fiber it doesn't that would give you a 5.4
grams net carb so the carbs and kale you know are are not zero so here's the
point that i'm trying to make i might be confusing people you don't
want to do juicing unless you're doing some type of
juice powder concentrate or some type of green
juice that doesn't have these other vegetables that are a little too
high celery juice is is a really good one to look at you're
going to have to look through different vegetables to find which one
would give you the least amount of carbs if you're going to do the juice
but i don't recommend doing the juice while you're fasting
but as a part of your meal i think that would be fine unless you do the
calculations and it comes down to a very very small amount
i wouldn't recommend it you may not get into full ketosis if you're doing it
each day and you may start craving carbs
so anytime someone is doing fasting or keto and they're still craving i always
look at what they're eating when they're fasting and what they're eating when
they stop fasting and we really look at
all the potential areas that you might have carbs
and this is a hidden area that could keep you
from fully getting the benefits of keto to the point where you you're just going
to crave and then what's going to happen is you're going to go off the program
eat carbs and then start again and do the whole cycle back and forth
so if you wanted to get rid of the cravings and completely do this right
get rid of the juicing okay and you can also
take inositol inositol is a type of b vitamin which is a sugar alcohol your
body makes it so it's natural
and it has some really interesting effects it's
really good for your blood sugars and addressing insulin resistance
in fact there's certain studies that show that it can work almost
the same as metformin which is for type 2
diabetes so it helps to improve that insulin resistance situation
and anything that's connected to that which is cravings to carbohydrates
it can also increase your serotonin which if you have a serotonin deficiency
you might feel stressed and craving carbs so serotonin as a hormone can help
you reduce cravings to carbs so you could take some
of this each day and also if they come in the tablet you
can suck on them because they're actually sweet but
they're not sugar i used to do this in my practice a lot
when someone craved carbs i would have them take this and then through the
day just suck on them and it gave them the feeling that they were
eating sugar but they weren't eating sugar
and it really helped them in other ways one last point
when you consume food and you're not satisfied
and you still have the need to eat after you eat
it could be that you need bile salts in which case
you can get them take them with the meal and you'll extract more of the fatty
acids from that food to signal the brain
to completely turn off the appetite and feel like you're satisfied because if
you're deficient in bile salts and that fat is not being fully digested
and absorbed that could be another reason why you keep craving things
all right thanks for watching before you go

i'm going to talk about oral thrush which is like a candida type yeast white tongue situation
and a high carb diet now normally candida which is like this fungus yeast structure lives inside
your body and it doesn't bother you unless you take an antibiotic and kill off all the bacteria
that are keeping this candida in check and when you do that you throw things out of balance and
you get an overgrowth of this yeast and that's when you get candida and if it's in the mouth
it's called thrush and it's white tongue but what's very interesting you can also develop this
by consuming a lot of sugar because guess what it eats sugar it ferments sugar all types of sugar
milk sugar table sugar fructose even things that turn into sugar pretty quick like refined grains
and starches so any carbohydrate that you can ferment can turn this somewhat neutral candida
into a unfriendly version of candida and when it becomes unfriendly they call it candidiasis
and it can live in the vaginal area the skin the throat the mouth and that's called thrush it can
grow in your esophagus it can live in your gi tract people that are at risk for getting this
oral thrush are people that take steroids people that are underlying stress because stress inhibits
the immune system if someone has hiv they're going to be at risk if someone's taking birth control
pills or estrogen they can be at risk because too much estrogen can actually cause this situation
as well and of course if you're diabetic because all this extra sugar is going to feed this yeast
like candida structure and i already mentioned antibiotics so if you have oral thrush one of
the best remedies is grapefruit seed extract not grape seed extract grape fruit seed extract
you just take 10 drops in about 3 tablespoons of water slug it on down do that once to three times
per day you can also keep in your mouth and swish it around for like maybe 20 seconds and
then swallow it that might help a grapefruit seed extract is a very effective natural anti-fungal

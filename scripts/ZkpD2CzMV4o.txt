so before we talk about the liver i want to share with you an amazing and amazing success story that
i just got check this out now this was sent to me by someone by the name of genevieve sylvester
and this person is a sonographer someone who uses ultrasound to help evaluate different organs like
your liver or kidney abdomen etc so you're putting sound waves in the body to help visualize what's
going on the inside dr berg i'm a sonographer and i've seen it all about nine months ago i had
a young woman come in for an ultrasound of her abdomen because her liver enzymes were elevated
a lot her liver was looking beyond just fatty it was dense in what we described as difficult
to penetrate she grew up on processed foods and pop we chatted a bit and i told her my thoughts
on the food industry and its devastating effect it had on humans fast forward six months later
same patient came back for a follow-up and looked at a previous study before scanning
her again i put my transducer that's the thing that you actually rub on the outside of the skin
that sends sound waves on her abdomen and i actually thought i had the wrong patient
previously her liver measured 19 centimeters that's enlarged and now it was 14 centimeters
which is normal i asked her if she had changed her diet and she said yes she changed over to keto
after we talked about it to see what would happen i then asked her if she watched anyone on youtube
and by the way i was going to send her your information but she said some doctor named
berg but my results stopped a few days ago so i was going to stop i said no don't i'm going
to show you why so i showed her what her liver looked like six months prior compared to what
it looks like now she started crying a happy cry i didn't tell you yet dr berg but i work at a native
reservation where everyone's liver is at least fatty and 80 percent of the population is type 2
diabetic this young woman mid-20s by the way was on her way to diabetes she was so excited and she
left knowing she healed herself like her ancestors before her she told me she was going to watch more
of your videos and continue to heal and she did say her brother has started when she did as well
and had some encouraging results with him too so there my story of a young woman who literally
turned her world around and ended her family curse of getting diabetes thank you so much
for your wisdom wow talk about a success story and by the way now on our site we are
actively and aggressively accumulating success stories and i desperately want your success story
too i'm going to be doing a lot more videos to share these success stories but i thought it'd
be great to share this amazing success story with you before i talk a little bit about the liver now
a lot of people that have a fatty liver also have diabetes so what is the connection the connection
is they're both caused by the same thing usually and that would be insulin resistance now what
causes insulin resistance too much insulin anytime we have too much of a certain hormone
going into receptor the receptor will protect itself against this excessive communication
by becoming resistant or downgraded that's what insulin resistance is it's a compensation
so now when we get a resistance to this hormone then the signals don't get back to the pancreas so
we get this lack of return communication it will be similar to someone wearing earplugs as you're
talking to them and they're not receiving your communication so you're going to start shouting
to them right same thing happens with insulin if we get this resistance at the receptor level at
the return communication the pancreas doesn't get that acknowledgement and so it starts to put out
more and more communication and so hormones are communication so now we have a situation where
we have the receipt part is not receiving and the communication part is excessively communicating
and that's only going to go so far to the point where now the pancreas is going to get tired it's
exhausted and it's like okay i'm i'm done with communicating that's when we get diabetes okay
so now we lose the function of insulin which is the regulation of blood sugar and so now we get
nothing to push the blood sugar down so the blood sugars go up and up and up so with all
this insulin now which is a storage hormone for glucose and all this carbohydrate that originally
created this high insulin we're going to get a fatty liver and so 25 to 46
of the population has a fatty liver and so when the liver becomes fatty it spills over into the
other organs and around the organs around your gut that's called visceral fat so if you were
to look down right now and you see something protruding out like your belly is protruding out
chances are you have a fatty liver if you had an ultrasound you probably could see that you have
a fatty liver so what can you do very simply if you're new to my channel click the link down below
because i have a whole plan for you number one you're going to get unhealthy keto
you're going to cut your carbs down you're going to bring your sugars down to zero number
two you're gonna stop snacking okay because every time you eat you trigger insulin and then you're
gonna start doing intermittent fasting so you're gonna drop your breakfast do just two meals for
right now and then i would also recommend adding choline to your diet because choline can help you
speed up the process to get this fat off the liver now just as a side note artificial sweeteners okay
like in diet soda can also create insulin resistance but overall this is the plan i
highly recommend you do it so you can also have a success story like this young lady
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

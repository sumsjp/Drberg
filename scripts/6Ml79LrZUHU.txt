my name is Nancy balsoy the reason I
came is because um
I wasn't happy with myself
I've gained a lot of weight
I was tired
and I just I was looking for help
I was involved in an accident last year
August
and I've been having Restless sleeps
I've been fatigued but the kind of job I
do I'm constantly working
so we were looking for answers because
we had tried everybody we had been sent
to so many doctors and it wasn't working
so when I came up when I came to him it
kind of because the things he was
answering and things he was saying were
I kind of felt he was talking to me
on my first visit Dr Berg um
he started talking about the youth kind
of body types
and when he talked about the the kind of
adrenaline kind of body that kind of
that was me
so he captured me there because finally
I thought okay somebody seems to
understand what I've been telling other
doctors would think I'm
nuts Maybe
so um he explained how my body was
feeling he talked he kind of was stating
things that I was about to tell him so I
kind of felt okay we're in sync here so
skeptical but
enough I was I was skeptical but I was I
was at the same time trusting that this
doctor might have something that no
other doctors told me yet
I was impressed
impressed enough that I I signed up
right away like can I get on your
program can you see me
Dr Burr comes across very soft-spoken
but when he comes in the room he comes
when he wanted you to understand what
he's telling you so when you when he's
talking to you he's coming he comes off
at a point where he knows I've actually
finally connected with you and then he
explains himself to you and he listens
he when you complain when like when I
came like the first time I came I came
with my sister and my sister had a lot
to go on but Dr Berge was very patient
in listening to what my sister had to
say
and he listened to everything he said
but then after she had finished she says
okay what you're explaining to me is he
went back through what she had explained
which actually really captivated me
because my sister went first and I
followed
but he listened to what we were saying
and he explained back what we were
feeling Dr Berg explained that what we
were feeling so that was very his
communication with us was at a level
where we felt at least he's a doctor
doctor she's a doctor but he's listening
to what we were saying so that was
convincing enough for us
if I could get as many people if I could
get anybody who was skeptical
I would convince them because I I'm
skeptical myself but he got me on the
first doctor bird got me on the first
round I would encourage anybody to come
over

today we're going to talk a little bit about tendons and doing rehab for a chronic tendon
problem and the thing you don't want to do is you don't want to rest it there's some really
interesting data by jill cook i'm going to put her link down below it was actually quite interesting
because she was talking about a study that was comparing an abnormal dysfunctional tendon with a
normal tendon and looking at the difference between both now in the dysfunctional tendon
there was some thickening but what was very interesting was the abnormal tendon had more
normal tissue than the normal tendon that means that a person would have plenty of good tissue
to do load training or resistance type training so if you do what most therapists do where they
actually recommend rest ice heat manual therapy etc you're probably not going to get anywhere
but if you do load training where you're putting the body under a very gradual stress
starting with baby steps and slowly increasing being more load on that tendon over time you're
going to get a really good adaptation because there's enough good tissue there to work with
she also talks about the inflammatory process not really being a trigger for tendon problems
so this would explain if you do ice and heat and all these other physical therapies you
just won't really get anywhere but if you personally have a tendon problem and you're
trying to rehab it with rest and you're not getting anywhere now you know why so if you're

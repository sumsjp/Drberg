so someone had a question why is xylitol dangerous for dogs
well it's not dangerous for humans and other animals but
dogs have a different metabolism for xylitol xylitol is a sugar alcohol
it's used in gums as an alternative to sugar
it's used in toothpaste they even use it for sinus remedies to actually clear out
some mucus in your sinuses it also helps reduce plaquing on your
teeth it's in a lot of keto um cookies and baked goods some
medications lotions and gels and chewable vitamins
sugar-free mints it's in a lot of different things
but you want to make sure that your dog doesn't get a hold of this why
because it creates a massive insulin release okay so normally
carbohydrates will create a massive insulin release
but for dogs you get this spike in insulin
when they consume xylitol so what this is going to do it's going to
bring the blood sugars way down it's going to cause hypoglycemia
and that is the the side effect from xylitol weakness staggering
the dog could start vomiting and if the amount is greater than 5 grams per
kilogram of weight there could be some liver toxicity and
damage so you want to bring your dog to the vet
and they'll usually do a treatment they may do an intravenous
glucose treatment to raise the blood sugar up to handle this hypoglycemia but
there you have it now you know why xylitol is not good

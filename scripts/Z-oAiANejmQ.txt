hello everyone i have a special guest today uh joseph is here
a great amazing success story welcome joe welcome to dr berg
hey listen tell us all about where you were what was happening and uh before
you uh found out about keto well it goes back to 1995 and i was a four pack a day smoker wow
so luckily uh my friend's wife made an appointment for him to go for acupuncture and i had tried to
quit smoking i couldn't quit smoking and anyway i went for one session and i walked out of there
february 20th 1995 and i haven't smoked since wow but i immediately started packing on the pounds
so and everybody i sent a lot of guys to this fellow and probably 80 percent of them quit
but anyway i was packing on the pounds and i no matter what i did i was i wasn't eating junk food
i was eating chicken fish salads drinking water and black coffee with you know and i
i gained weight and so anyway i built a gym in my basement and i religiously worked out for eight uh
six days a week for eight years i was doing the treadmill an hour a day at four miles an hour
on the high incline and three days a week doing weights and i wasn't drinking alcohol
or anything like that and i just blew up 80 pounds from once 62 at the time one to 242
so i finally threw in the towel i said i'm not getting anywhere i'm just
wasting all this time working out and i'm i'm eating good food supposedly but
i was eating wheat bread i told you to eat wheat right and i was eating wheat bread
and anyway fast forward 18 years from february uh 95 and that's where i got hooked up with you
and uh i said geez that makes a lot of sense and so the first week i started i on the 18 hour day
fast and uh like uh six hour eating one day and lo and behold i lost two pounds i couldn't even
the next week i lost another two and it was cumulative eight pounds the first
month 10 months later i shed the 80 pounds i never starved you know i was you know eating
you know good food and then go out to 14 months this i started in june 2013
in in august 2014 i was down 100 my wife has also lost 97 pounds
oh my god and you won't believe how great i feel i i i was a health wreck i was on lipitor and uh
like i remember patching cracks in my driveway and if i was kneeling down
i couldn't even get up i am like a teenager now i've got so much energy and
my blood pressure well now it's getting a little low i don't know my blood pressure
this morning was 99 67 and 82. i don't know if that's too low but it's usually running around
115 120 but it's been a little low lately so i'm not sure if that makes you just do is add a little
bit of salt add a little bit of salt i i do i use the pink himalayan salt but i well i shifted over
i drink a lot of tea with the pink himalayan salt and uh turmeric and a little pepper
and apple cider vinegar and but for the last week or so i've been drinking some coffee with the
stevia but i'm kind of you know phased out of the tea a little bit but i'm going back into it again
i drink organic green tea do you drink a lot during the day uh yes i probably drink four
cups of it during the day great so all you have to really do is just add the the b1 back into things
like the nutritional yeast if you're doing some of that because the tea and coffee will deplete b1
and that could affect the blood pressure either one way or the other but i have a question so at
your maximum weight you were at 200 and how how many pounds did were you at your max 42 and a
half pounds and how much did you wear and how much did you get down to today what do you weigh down
i weighed this morning i weighed 133.2
wow this is amazing
down almost 100 well i was down 110 pounds from my highway wow so other than the bread before
now that you're eating it what else was different is it the fasting part that
because before maybe you're snacking like what's the difference before and now i think i think
the working out was creating cortisol which ushers in insulin and i think it was stress from cortisol
working out i mean i was like a theme working out and i think it was cortisol counteracting
uh my weight loss wow wow but also you probably weren't fasting before correct
no i wasn't okay i was eating like three meals and i wasn't fasting and
i was pretty good i didn't eat a lot of junk food pastas and pizza and all that
but no matter what i did the weight wouldn't budge wow and so and i i'm a
religious follower of yours i've sent so many of my friends uh to you and told them about you
and you're you're just incredible i love you dr bird i mean my wife she couldn't lose any any
weight she's down 97. she has a way to go we caught we called the show in 2019 and
you you recommended that my wife uh eat every other day well she hasn't done that so much we're
like one meal a day and but she's kind of plateau but she she started to drop down a little bit
great good good food grass-fed beef we eat a lot of veggies i grow kale
and and stuff like that and we eat healthy that's so amazing what's what can i ask your age
i'm going to be 72 in february you do not look 72 you look like you're you're you're young that's
amazing i could just see you you just have that youth i feel like a teenager dr burke
amazing you can't believe how good i feel i got a little i've got a little farm here and i've
got chickens and rabbits and pigs and tilapia i got an aquaponics system and i grow veggies
and tell them that we lost the pr too oh no we're about that right now but
we've lost combined well you figured out that my wife is 97 pounds and i'm almost 110
so there you go called the show on the 29th of uh september in 2019 and karen made a comment he says
this was rooster approved because she heard the roosters in the background
i love it i love it we have um seven chickens and uh boy the uh we let them roam around for
the day and the the uh the brightness of those those egg yolks and the taste it's so different
we had we had over 500 chickens at the time wow yes that's that's a lot of eggs i want to wish
you and steve in here in a very merry christmas and your family too oh thank you so much we wish
you merry christmas as well that's great i'm just so excited that you guys are just gonna
go ahead we're doing great i i attended your keto summit was i supposed to get
some cds on a keto summit uh no just the digital access links to the digital access
did you get the digital um yeah did you get the links
okay if you didn't get the links let me know and we'll send them to you but um
yeah we'll get it to you it's uh not dvd it's just basically the latest
yeah i guess i guess uh people don't even have cd players anymore it's kind of uh
it's interesting i don't know
i'll definitely get those to you i'm glad so you watched the uh
the whole summit last year that we had that
11 o'clock we watch every friday at 11 o'clock oh that's great that's great
yeah and i tell every i tell everybody i just i told about three people this week
about you oh man that's i appreciate that and i
and uh matter of fact we i told one guy and oh and not only i want to before i forget
i was at a farm market a couple of years ago
and i met a friend of yours and we were talking and michael burr you know michael burr
that rings a bell yeah he when i told him as i showed him before and after picture
and he said how'd you do i said i follow dr berg i do the keto the keto diet oh wow that is so great
it's well actually it's really good just to meet you know someone that actually has been watching
the videos because i'm i do a lot of videos and i always wondered who's watching these videos so i
it's real nice to meet you and uh hear your wife as well but uh this is so great
oh my gosh she's just saw her today she's she's like the epitome of keto healthy
because she doesn't do any sugar this kid's no sugar and it's at two years and she's
still doing partial breastfeeding as well and so you have that immune system but you talk about
perfect dental structure and uh perfect balance and articulate and be able to learn i mean i'm
just blown away so we're doing the cod liver oil the omega-3 fatty acids and um i have some sausage
with organ meats that she's eating that so it's just amazing so how old is she she's actually um
just over two years old oh great inaudible yeah that's right yeah she's great she's awesome that's
what my wife's birthday is we've we've been married for 53 years now wow that's so amazing
you're you're way past the uh the average which is like i think seven or two years or something
like that that's wow that's amazing we've we've aged in reverse doing following your plan i love
you it you can't believe i can't tell you how great i feel i'm like a teenager i i bounce
around this place to take care of my animals uh usually ten years ago uh i was a health wreck
wow for those of you who don't show when you eat good food
it's just like if you have a race engine if you put good race gas in it it runs good if you put
regular gas in it'll just fall apart exactly for those of you watching if you're new to keto here's
a perfect example i'm going to put the link down below just for just for what's it what to eat
and the videos you need to watch to be educated but you know as we get older
there's two problems one is the body tends to slow down but you can reverse it you can
maximize it to make sure you doesn't slow down and also your cognitive function you're sharp
you're like there's so many people that even in their 70s that are just kind of mentally losing
it unfortunately completely unnecessary here's proof right here you're going to see my wife's
aunt dr berg she's going to be 101 on the 28th of january and she is sharp as a tech and healthy as
she lives on her own she's you wouldn't believe it you talked to her on the phone do you think
she's 50 years old or something like that that is that's that's right i said the word i asked her
i says aunt rita what's your secret you know he says well i ate a lot of vegetables and salads
and she was never obese and wow she's going to be 101. oh my god
why not why not i mean gosh this is the whole aging thing is like i think overrated people
are like they they think you have to have all these problems and they're on the meds like it's
unnecessary if you just get the basic eating thing implemented in your fasting and it's the
most important thing and uh you're proof good good fuel in your body and once i started i never felt
so good that's great i never felt so good dr berg that is awesome this is so amazing it's just it
blows me away and my weight right now when i was in high school you know 50 years ago i was 148 and
a half pounds now i'm down to uh below 132 pounds wow and i don't starve myself i eat i eat good
wow i wouldn't believe the veggies i make i got it in brussels sprouts and broccoli or aspara okra
and i use grass-fed butter and huge i eat grass-fed beef and salmon i eat salmon and
avocados oh that's so great joseph that's just amazing you're doing all the right things
yeah we do some keto desserts but not so much yeah it's not necessary you know i
don't i think for some people with gut issues it's probably not a good thing but yeah once
you get on this get the right stuff and your body gets satisfied you don't need this constant sweep
i can tell you before i remember before this all started my wife made me a big breakfast
i had three eggs i had wheat toast i had five turkey sausages and i had some other stuff and and
i was at lowe's getting some lumber and an hour and a half later i'm i'm getting i'm getting the
shakes and getting headaches and i'm i think i'm starving which i wasn't starving but i'm getting
the shakes and jittery and now unbelievable an hour and a half later so i had to go at the
time grabbed two snickers bars because i was i was going i was really uh what that you know sugar is
yeah i guess my should fight it but anyway the longest day i did this it and it just happened one
one wednesday night i ate it finished at seven o'clock so the next day thursday i wasn't
hungry so i didn't eat i hate my tea friday come along i still wasn't hungry so i had my tea and
saturday come along i still am not hungry so i i didn't eat saturday sunday came along i was
not hungry and and so one day come along i'm not hungry but we had to go out with
our friend that night so i did eat but i went from wednesday night to monday night with no
food and i was never never hungry at all wow wow burning your own way yeah i bet that is so awesome
that's what i was eating but i was eating my body yeah you were you're living on a high fat diet
in your own your own fat joseph this is amazing i want to just thank you adapted like yeah getting
100 fat burning and it's very satisfying well it's really appreciate you spending time uh
giving me your story because i have you a featured story and i the pictures on my website and i was
like oh my gosh i said call this guy i want to do an interview because it's amazing with the
with the before and after so um a lot of people are going to be inspired by this joe so it is
i owe it all to you dr berg hey without you you know people need the knowledge
the people need the knowledge of what to do yeah and uh i'm telling you you're spot on
i uh i i like i recommend you to everybody wow well i appreciate that well i'm
i really enjoy it it's very satisfying and i'm gonna keep doing that but it's so
getting this basic eating plan and it's like just educating people make it
understandable i mean and then when people can finally do it they're like
okay this really does work but sometimes it takes a while for it to sink in with some people
but um you know it was amazing i like i i forward your videos too uh one of your uh uh success story
is krista that lost over 200 pounds oh yeah she went from 315 down to 138 pounds in two years
amazing i forward that video to quite a few people
it's it's actually a mind-blowing thing you know i thought even a hundred pounds per you know
in weight loss in a year is huge i had a guy who came to one of my i think the last last two years
he um lost six well he was 700 pounds now he's like 220. that's
that's unusual it's crazy but um you know what why not if you have that much fat
you ride the wave you're going to eventually lose it if you do the right thing so
i could tell you this is doesn't pertain to keto but uh i was at work and my one friend
uh i was talking to him and this girl walks by and my buddy tom says what do you think of that girl
i said she's gorgeous then then he lays this on me
she used to weigh 305 pounds it says get out and she lost 180 pounds in two and a half
years but she did it eating 1250 calories a day of the right food and she worked out in the gym for
four hours a day six days a week but you wouldn't believe this girl she's five foot two 123 pounds
perfect hourglass and then he tells me she weighed 305 pounds that's just kidding wow
i've i've seen that in my clinic i had a gal that she was over to her she wasn't that big but she
was 200 pounds and uh you know she basically got her original figure back and very very happy and
her husband is very happy as well and so it's just amazing i mean
the sky's the limit if you actually have the com combined with the right amount of
exercise and recovery and you do this you could really shape your reshape your body
in a very dynamic i didn't exercise at all to lose this weight dr berg that is amazing before i did
eight eight eight years in the gym and religiously six days a week six days on the treadmill and
three three days a week doing weights that i did that prior and i couldn't lose any weight
over training over training oh thank you very much dr berg i love you and so is my wife we oh we love
you guys and we too healthy as can be my pleasure and thank you so much for your great success
okay dr berg okay have a great christmas you too

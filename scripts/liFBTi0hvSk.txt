now it's very very important if you have children to make sure that those kids especially if
they're very young have enough zinc in their diet and to make sure they're not consuming
anything that can be depleting them of zinc mostly because the neurons in the forebrain
are dependent on zinc that's the part of the brain that's involved in the cognitive processes
thinking memory speaking there's two very interesting studies that show the
link between having a zinc deficiency and experiencing neuropsychological problems
especially reasoning now reasoning has to do with thinking about something in a logical
sensible way now if you have teenagers by the way you may have
experienced some lack of reasoning occasionally well that could be a simple zinc deficiency
because zinc has everything to do with supporting the cognitive part of your brain
and if you don't have enough zinc you inhibit the capacity to learn you reduce the ability for
someone to have attention on what they're doing you cause poor retention of data that's called
poor memory and they even found that kids that are deficient in zinc play less than kids that have
enough zinc interesting if a mother who's carrying a child is deficient in zinc she could pass on a
child that has poor memory so it's very very important if you're pregnant to take zinc
if you're breastfeeding to take zinc and as a child to take zinc now i think it's probably very
important to talk about what depletes think more than taking zinc because the number one reason
why kids are deficient in zinc is because of phytic acid and you get phytic acid in cereal okay
the amount of cereal that these kids eat is just blocking their zinc cereal corn corn chips popcorn
soy soy products it's in so many different things and also wheat because grains
have phytic acid especially in the bran as in whole wheat there's more phytic acid in whole
wheat than there is in refined wheat as in white flour so we need to get our kids off these grains
we need to get them on healthy keto and we need to make sure they have enough
zinc hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

hi guys dr. berg here in this video I want to answer the question if I lose
too much weight on the ketogenic diet will I end up with loose sagging belly
skin okay and the answer is none if you do this correctly what's happening is
you're losing the structural matrix of protein around your body when you have a
loose skin it's like the whole structure just kind of sags in droops it's called
atrophy okay you can see it also in the hips to cellulite and a lot of times
that's a protein deficiency but you can't consume protein to fix it and the
reason is because it's not going in the cells why because of insulin resistance
insulin resistance is one of the most common things that occur with people
that are gaining weight especially in the midsection and then have loose
sagging skin because insulin one of the functions of insulin is to help you
absorb protein or amino acids and when you have that resistance it blocks the
protein from going in there so that's why I like diabetics for example have a
lot of problems with loose skin and sagging skin because they can't absorb
this protein so the ketogenic diet fixes the insulin resistance so just to hammer
this point across insulin resistance prevents protein from being formed
structurally around the waist or the hips and protein is heavier than fat so
many people hit this point where they plateau with the weight but they're
shrinking their stomach is going down their skin is coming back they're not as
loose and that is because you're fixing insulin resistance the amino acids are
going in the cell the proteins are being formed okay one last thing I always
recommend doing the intermittent fasting with the ketogenic diet to spiked growth
hormone and growth hormone will actually help preserve your proteins even more
thanks for watching hi guys and hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause
the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz
now and we'll send you report

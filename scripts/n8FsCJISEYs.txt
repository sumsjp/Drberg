so I have a question have you sort of fell off the wagon no longer doing keto
or IF because you're in quarantine so if this is you you not only want to
practice social distancing but you want to practice carb distancing in fact one
where the mass to avoid these deadly carb particles that could be invading
your nostrils and tempting you when your family just ordered out some pizza and
junk food that you shouldn't be eating some people have this idea that when
they go off track they're going to get back on track they have to do a sugar
detox and I just want to explain that there's really no such thing as a sugar
detoxification you're not detoxifying sugar when you've been eating sugar and
you come off sugar to get back on the wagon what happens as you start eating
carbs and sugar and so the first place to feel it is the brain because the
brain has been using glucose as its primary fuel and now you stop consuming
the carbs well the brain doesn't have any stored sugar it gets its sugar from
other places in the body but not in the brain so you're gonna tap it out pretty
fast and then what's gonna happen next is you're gonna feel cognitive changes
you're gonna start craving sugar okay and then you might analyst might be hard
to believe you might actually give in to that craving and actually eat some carbs
because your body is putting you under pressure where you actually need to eat
those carbs and then you'll feel great and you may just have this idea that wow
I feel better with carbs maybe my body works different I need carbs because I
feel so much better but in actuality that got you in trouble in the first
place and I'll explain what to do you may also notice that you feel stressed
depressed anxiety and highly irritable okay
not to mention fatigue all of these symptoms are not sugar and detoxifying
all these symptoms are situation when you tapped out your stored sugar and
you're lacking whew to change over your fuel system from
glucose to fat unfortunately it doesn't happen in a second it's going to take
some time and it usually takes between two and a half to three days there's
several things that you can do to get you back on the wagon and get you to
burn fat again now realize that the brain if given the
choice between ketones and sugar and your blood that will always pick the
ketones first over your sugar what does that mean it means that you want to get
into ketosis as fast as possible and that really depends on keeping your
carbs low you will not be able to get in ketosis if you keep your carbs too high
you need to know that also MCT oil is a very inexpensive way to generate ketones
fast in the blood and feed those to your brain as fuel so you start getting rid
of these symptoms immediately so that's one thing I would recommend I also
realize that protein can be used in place of carbs to bring up your blood
sugars okay without creating too much of a problem unless you're consuming a lot
of protein the other thing that focus on is enough potassium foods because that's
going to also stabilize your blood Sugar's very nicely as in large servings
of salad okay or vegetable seven cups that will help you that will also feed
the microbes which then turn that into something called butyrate which will
help stabilize your blood sugars right there and give you some energy it's time
to get back on the wagon I understand that you're probably bored out of your
skull but you need to practice carb distancing and wear that mask to prevent
the aroma of your family cooking some of this food that you probably shouldn't be
eating alright thanks for watching

i wanted to create this video on the best exercise that you can do to increase your telomeres now
what's a telomere a telomere is like this protective coating
on the end of your chromosomes to protect your genes and the significance of this is that the
longer the telomeres the longer you potentially can live and so there's a whole series of
epigenetic things that you can do to keep these telomeres very very high and
i've done another video on all the different foods and remedies that you can take but in
this video we're going to talk specifically about exercise so based on the data so far
physical activity in general despite the type of exercise is associated with longer telomeres so in
other words the more active you are the longer you're going to live so the next point is this
there was a significant association with robust and moderate exercise and i'm mainly talking about
high intensity interval training okay that's a very intense workout but of short duration
and aerobic endurance training both of those types of exercise show significant association
with an increased telomere length now the reason why that is is because you're decreasing
oxidative stress you're actually getting your body into a situation where it's adapted enough
to handle more oxidative stress oxidative stress and inflammation are two things that really mess
up your genes and both of these exercises do reduce inflammation but in this study there was a
subgroup of exercise which is just aerobic exercise so it wasn't the endurance type
it was just a short workout of aerobic exercise and another category called resistance training
both of these subcategories did not show an association with increased telomere length however
there's a lot of great data on resistance training improving cardiovascular function decreasing risk
of dying from a heart attack and other reasons why you might die all right thanks for watching so if
you're enjoying my content which i hope you are and you're applying this knowledge to your health

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about a surprising finding with fibromyalgia
I have so many people coming in with this disorder and what's happening is they're getting on drugs
and they're trying remedies that are not working and I want to give you something else to look at
probably the last 9 out of 10 cases it came down to one problem that has to do with the congested
gallbladder the gallbladder is located underneath your right ribcage okay what happens when it gets
swollen when it gets congested it puts pressure on the diaphragm and a nerve called the phrenic
nerve that travels up through to the right shoulder up to the head and into the neck
the muscles in the upper trap area or the neck contract and cause the vertebra to rotate that
pinches the nerve the pain goes right down the right side goes up into the head so if you have
more right-sided so-called fibromyalgia then look at the gallbladder because that could be
the source of it and so what you do is you press into the gallbladder for about a minute or two
and see if this pain goes away if it is your gallbladder that pain will go away so fast and
you'll be very very shocked to find out it wasn't really fibromyalgia in the first place it was a
congested gallbladder because congested gall bladders create a lot of inflammation and pain
and they also quite bloating and digestive issue a lot of the upper part of the body especially
the neck in the head and even headaches are associated with the digestive system there
are a ton of nerves down here that go up upward through here even a nerve called the vagus nerve
and if you're any medical professions watching this it's called the enteric nervous system it's
part of the autonomic nervous system you have the sympathetic parasympathetic and the enteric
the enteric nervous system is all down here and that can also referred pain all the way
up here so what you can do is press into the area and if there is a relief then I would
start supporting the gallbladders probably change your eating take some bile salts of gallbladder
support formula and realize that the problem is not fibromyalgia it's something else so I
just want to bring that out and so go ahead and put your comments below and thanks for watching

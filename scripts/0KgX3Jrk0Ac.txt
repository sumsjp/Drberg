let's talk about nonstick cookware specifically teflon so there's a lot of things that people grew
up with that um at first they seemed to be totally safe and then all of a sudden they're now this
huge toxin there's all sorts of toxins in teflon especially when you're heating it and breaking
down certain elements in the lining of your pots and pans there's six toxic gases that are emitted
two of them are global pollutants and one is even lethal at low doses so when there's a high
amount of temperature you get this degradation of this chemical which is similar to a nerve gas
i'm not kidding and so it can lead to liver damage immune dysfunction thyroid dysfunction
chronic kidney dysfunction infertility in the list goes on and on but this is what i want to know
we've been using this for 70 years and somewhat recently now it's in a possible carcinogen
i mean where was the study 70 years ago how did this get passed so check this out i'm
going to read something to you the chemical pfoa persist indefinitely in the environment
what does that mean it means that it doesn't break down it's there forever pfoa has been detected
in the blood of many individuals in the general u.s population in the low and sub-parts per
billion range and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations
though those concentrations have decreased by 70 percent between 1999 and 2014 which coincides with
the end of the production and phase out of pfoa in the u.s now you're probably saying wait a second
how can it be in every single person's blood well check this out the general population has
been exposed to pfoa through massive dumping of c8 waste into the ocean and near the ohio
river valley so these chemicals tend to get into our environment get into our food supply and get
into our bodies so here's what you can do about it the word is bile transformation what is that
that is your body's ability to take these poisons and turn them into harmless particles through the
liver there are foods that you can be eating right now to help you break down these poisons
and even plastics that are in your body and you need to be consuming cruciferous vegetables on
a regular basis like the kale the brussels sprouts the broccoli the arugula the radish
so if you are not familiar with those foods i put a link down below but cruciferous have the
ability to decrease these poisons in your body so it slowly gets rid of them without you feeling
toxic because it's almost impossible to avoid our toxic environment you have to be doing things to
constantly clean your body of these poisons anyway sorry about the bad news but i also gave you some
good news of things that you can do to eliminate and remove these chemicals thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

you ever get a random muscle twitch for no reason
well you're not alone 70% of the population gets these random muscle twitches the medical term
for that is fasciculation not that you really cared but that's the name it's a spontaneous
involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation it could be on the eyelid it could be on the arm your
hands fingers legs or feet or even your tongue there's even a medical condition called benign
fasciculation syndrome the problem is that this condition is a nutritional deficiency but their
treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy and anti-depression medication and calcium channel
blockers which i'm going to come back to in a second so what you need to know is the random
muscle twitching is simply a magnesium deficiency and by the way 70 percent of the population has a
magnesium deficiency well must be a coincidence right if you have a magnesium deficiency there
are other things that can happen as well you could be tired you could have muscle cramps you
could have anxiety because people take magnesium to relax decrease their stress to help them with
sleep so if you have these muscle twitches just take a little magnesium magnesium usually comes
from leafy greens so it could be that you're not consuming enough but there are a couple of the
reasons why you might have a muscle twitch it could be that you have high amounts of calcium
now calcium magnesium work together the higher the calcium the lower magnesium so that would
actually correlate and also if you have low vitamin d levels that could be another reason
why you might have twitching now there is a relationship between vitamin d and magnesium
i'm going to put that video down below it's very interesting and the last reason why you might
have a muscle twitch is you have alkalosis and by the way if your ph is too alkaline
that can inhibit the calcium from transporting throughout the body in fact it can build up on
nerves and create the twitching and this is why apple cider vinegar is a good remedy for that
but a deeper cause of alkalosis could be either you're on a high carb diet
or your potassium is too low but what i'm trying to do in these videos is give you some
simple clues that you can identify nutritional deficiencies with and if you have a muscle twitch
it's usually going to be magnesium hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how

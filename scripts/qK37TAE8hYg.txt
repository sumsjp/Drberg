hi guys in this video we're going to talk about how to reverse wrinkles okay
as we age we get wrinkles some people get wrinkles too early and
some people don't get them hardly at all okay and I also want to talk about
collagen in general so taking your skin from a rough kind of wrinkly skin and
bringing it to more of a youthful skin what what controls that is something
called G a G it's a real long name you don't need to know it but it's
glycosaminoglycans okay so it's a chemical in your body that keeps the
skin in collagen hydrated electrically hydrated it helps repair proteins and
collagen in your skin it also helps you make healthy vibrant collagen and skin
alright and if you don't have this everything kind of sags and droops and
gets hardened and it's not necessarily the you know the sunlight over the years
that just makes your skin wrinkle in fact the sunlight will give you about a
minute and protect the skin but it really is a deficiency in this thing
right here as we age and also this is responsible for your discs in your spine
to be really healthy and hydrated so if you're shrinking as you're getting older
then we know you don't have enough of this okay but you can't just take this
as a supplement and see the change because what controls this hydrating
anti-wrinkle chemical is this thing right here it's called IGF number1
insulin-like growth factor number one so I'm going to talk about that it's a
hormone made by the liver that is kind of controlled by growth hormone which
also is the anti-aging hormone so this is kind of an extension off growth
hormone and some people actually take growth hormone as a supplement to get
youthful but there's some side effects to that so we don't want to take any
hormones we want to naturally figure out how to trigger this thing right here and
I'm going to tell you the seven ways to do it okay and it will improve your skin
greatly especially wrinkles okay number one
this hormone teeter-totters with insulin so if insulin is high this will be low
healthy young individuals need a hundred times more concentrated igf than insulin
so if you have insulin resistance for example or diabetes you're gonna have
higher insulin what will happen is this will go down and people don't realize
that this is really important to actually even help you reduce insulin
problems and even diabetes so so we want to reduce insulin and how do we do that
well we change the diet and I'll put some links down below you're going to
cut out the carbs you get your intermittent fasting
you're gonna avoid the hidden things that trigger insulin which is like MSG
monosodium glutamate there's a whole bunch of things and I'll put a link down
below so we want to decrease insulin number one number two we want to enhance
your sleep whatever way you do it um you can use my
supplement at the sleep aid or some other supplement but you need to fix the
reason why you can't sleep because sleeping will increase this hormone as
well if you're getting by on five or six hours of sleep you're gonna age quicker
okay so the sleep is important even if you have to take a nap and then lowering
cortisol that's the stress hormone that actually prevents you from sleeping and
it's just gonna this is coming from stress so increase stress will decrease
your sleep and decrease this as well stress will aid you right I'm gonna put
a link down below of some things to do for that this is like your checklist to
look at okay so hi intense interval training will also increase this hormone
I mean like amazingly so what we want to do is we want to do full-body exercise
so there's a lot of different exercises that you can do but you want involve as
many muscles as possible whether it's you're doing a spin bike burpees
push-ups some bootcamp class whatever it is you want to do this type
of exercise to do it high intensity very short lots of rest not as frequent and
then every other day or every third day make sure you don't over train but this
also will increase this this hormone and growth hormone so it's going to make you
look more youthful moderate amount of protein so if you think you're gonna add
more protein to help your wrinkles that's not going to work you just want a
moderate not too much because that'll stimulate
insulin how much is the right amount the sweet spot is three to six ounces
personally I'm a 195-pound six foot two I do five ounces of protein with each
meal okay it's a moderate amount of quality protein not the soy protein
isolate crap you need high quality grass-fed protein if you can get it or
at least organic okay next one is enhanced the liver of course there's a
lot of things to this you know of course avoiding alcohol alcohol will make you
age eat organic a lot of vegetables maybe some supplements to support milk
thistle would be good dandelion root is good for the liver things to improve the
liver because the liver makes IGF number-one if you have a gut for example
we know you have a fatty liver so that's going to be something your goal is to
get rid of the fat off the liver I'll put a link down below of how to do that
but the main thing is getting off the things that are stimulant insulin and
you can reverse that and there's other things as well but next one is
intermittent fasting intermittent fasting is is you eat a meal and then
you're not going to eat for a period of time and then you can eat again like
you're not gonna have any snacks between that meal there's more to this but the
point is that when you don't eat you're stimulating growth hormone okay you're
stimulating this hormone this hormone is activated when you're not eating
insulin is activated when you're eating so insulin will deactivate this so the
more you do intermittent fasting the more you're gonna enhance this and
you're gonna have to work harder as you reach 50 years old in 60 and 70 because
your liver kind of becomes unmoor healthy over time okay
intermittent fasting and the last one is fat soluble vitamins
so that would be vitamin A vitamin D vitamin k2 and all of that is enhanced
with certain types of healthy fats I believe I demands so I get my fat Sabo
vitamins from egg yolks pasture-raised organic egg yolks oh my gosh that will
give you all the fat side of vitamins you need and you can also do cod liver
oil and you can do grass-fed butter but again the fat size of vitamins are
really important into enhancing this hormone to increase this all right hope
that helped so go ahead and do this and and show us the results thanks for

hi guys I want to talk about blood Sugars I want to talk about what is a
normal blood sugar well typically it's between eighty and a hundred milligrams
per deciliter sometimes it could be seventy if you're you know it can go
down if you're completely giving up sugar can go even lower and that's a
total normal situation now what does this mean eighty to a hundred
milliliters per deciliter basically that means the ratio of how much sugar that
you have in your blood now an average person of 165 pounds
has one in one-third gallons of blood in their body okay gallon and one-third of
a gallon of blood and the if it was normal let's say was ninety okay right
in the middle that would be kind of a heaping slightly more than a teaspoon
not quite a heaping but slightly a little bit more than a teaspoon of sugar
per all this blood okay that's if we diluted that that would be ninety okay
that would be normal blood sugars and you can actually convert protein and
even fat into sugar so you don't even need carbs to get this normal ratio but
an average American consumes 31 teaspoons of sugar every single day
that's a hundred and thirty to 145 pounds of sugar a year and it has
lifetime it's a dumpster full of sugar now this
is why most of the population is becoming pre-diabetic and diabetic and
the problem is they don't know that they're actually a diabetic yet or they
don't know they're a pre-diabetic because it's not showing up on the blood
test okay it won't show up because it starts off small and it gets worse and
worse and worse and then one day you have it okay but some of the symptoms
are you know you get tired after you eat you crave sweets you hat you're not
satisfied after you eat you can't go many hours without eating and
when you eat you feel better that's a pre-diabetic situation but you don't
need a lot of sugar in your diet to have a normal blood sugar in fact I recommend
you go zero sugar and your sugars will be you will clear up so many health
problems if you do that ok so here's to two points I'm going to make you don't
need sugar ok like some people say well doesn't your brain running a sugar no it
can run on fat it can run on other fuels your body does not need sugar alright

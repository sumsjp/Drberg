now if you're prone to kidney stones or you have high oxalates in your urine which makes
a person more prone to kidney stones there's a couple things that you can do but first let's
talk about the symptoms of a kidney stone number one low back pain number two flank pain which is
pain in the back just below the rib cage on either side indicating which kidney has a stone usually
there could be blood in the urine there could be frequent urination there can also be painful
urination those are all symptoms now why would someone have more oxalates in the urine and
by the way your body makes oxalates and they also come from the food and they kind of help
you regulate excessive amounts of calcium in fact that's one of the functions of oxalates and plants
because if there's too much calcium in the plant that can kill the plant
so that's why the plant develops oxalates to help regulate the excess amount of calcium
now normally you're supposed to have a certain amount of oxalates not too much okay but if you do
what are the causes you could have a genetic problem which by the way
that can be dealt with i'm going to talk about what to do if there's weakness within your kidney
you can have a problem with building up more oxalates in the kidney number three if you
have a bypass surgery that can cause you to have more oxalates if you have some type of
an intestinal problem that can cause you to have more oxalates if your diet is composed of foods
that are high in oxalates that can give you more oxalates like spinach black tea almonds chocolate
soda and cola hopefully you're not doing that soybeans soy milk spinach i already mentioned that
sweet potato black tea or tofu all have higher amounts of oxlets if you have higher oxalates
or you're prone to kidney stones there are four things that you must do that will greatly help you
number one you want to start taking calcium the type of calcium i'm going to recommend is calcium
lactate take about 250 milligrams before bed what will that do that's going to combine with
the oxalates in your intestine and allow them to go through the body so they're not reabsorbed and
end up in the kidney okay number two you want to start taking citrates you can do it through lemon
juice like a half a cup a day or you can take potassium citrate because the citrate will prevent
the calcium from binding with the oxalates number three drink 2.5 liters of fluid per day
it's about 10 and a half cups of liquid kidney stones occur when you have a super saturation
of calcium and oxalates so if you're drinking the fluid you'll never have that concentration
and number four reduce foods high in oxalates and i just mentioned the foods that you need to avoid

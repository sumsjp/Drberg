you know when you look around uh at the difference between men and women one big difference is where
they hold their fat so with women they have more what's called subcutaneous fat
the superficial layer underneath the skin and they have more deposits of fat
and what is called the gluteal femoral and that's the buttocks the hips because femoral femur that's
in your thighs and then you have gluteal which is the butt area and the wraps around the hips but
with men they don't really hold their fat as much subcutaneously they hold it more viscerally in the
gut right and what determines where they hold the weight is the level of estrogen they have as far
as the risk factors to other problems whether or not the subcutaneous fat which is caused by
estrogen is more protective against some of these metabolic diseases visceral fat is way more
dangerous because it puts you at risk for heart disease diabetes inflammation insulin resistance
a fatty liver and metabolic diseases which is diabetes high blood pressure etc and so
women have less risk factors for getting all these conditions due to the amount of estrogen
until they reach menopause where this risk factor then is now equal to a man why because of the drop
in estrogen now your fat tissue called adipose tissue is glandular it produces hormone it is
a storage for fuel it has many other functions and so when you get insulin resistance you can
have insulin resistance of different tissues you can have insulin resistance of your liver
you can have insulin resistance in your muscles in your fat cells which then can impair the function
of your fat cell now what's going to happen is now that fat cell is not holding or accepting the fat
anymore you get this spillover effect which this fat then becomes something called ectopic which
means it no longer goes in the adipose tissue it goes in other organs around organs in between
organs and then this causes more dysfunction in the gland and it can also worsen insulin
resistance so you have insulin resistance which increases insulin which is causing more fat to
be in your liver and other organs and then you have the fat and the organs in the liver
actually causing insulin resistance so both of these situations are feeding each other
now if you read some of the research on this they'll always recommend the solution being you
need to lose weight okay and many times they don't actually mention going on a low carb diet which is
quite interesting they just focus on the losing weight but if you try to lose weight without
lowering your carbohydrates you're not necessarily going to fully resolve this insulin resistance
problem because insulin is the main storage for fat insulin is the main hormone that determines
whether you're going to burn fat or not because when insulin goes up your body is going to then
prevent the loss or the burning of that fat i wouldn't necessarily focus on just losing weight
i would focus on primarily getting your insulin down fixing insulin resistance to do that the best
way is to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting and for that information i put the link down below
check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

so let's talk about what actually causes an autoimmune condition let me just
briefly tell you what an autoimmune condition is it's a situation where your
body has created immune cells that are attacking itself and that creates
inflammation and inflammation creates a lot of collateral damage and it's all
those free radicals that end up destroying the tissue and the immune
cells that are attacking itself are called autoantibodies and you can have
these autoantibodies to pretty much any tissue in your body you can have them to
receptors of cells you can have these immune cells attack pretty much any
tissue of the body and so what an autoimmune condition boils down to is
this one cell called the th17 cell becoming over active okay excessive
amounts of the T it's called helper cell 17 are responsible for autoimmune
conditions so now let me just kind of explain what this cell is in your immune
system you have a lot of different players and you have different types of
T cells and the T stands for thymus because that's where it gets its
training and that's where it matures and develops and typically the T helper
cells have to do with command control they're like the quarterback or the
general that recruits help for infection that generates the weaponry like
cytokines in the inflammatory process so it's the main controller of the battle
with infections so it's a real key element when someone's infected with the
HIV virus what that virus does is it targets the T helper cells and it knocks
those guys out so you have no more immune system at all well in an
autoimmune condition you have an over activation of these cells right here
th17 cells one of the functions of these cells is to maintain in the intestinal
barrier okay the barrier between microbes pathogens and the inside of the
body I'm talking about the lymph nodes
capillaries the vascular system so it's really the maintaining of that barrier
and also to help maintain the microbiome homeostasis so to keep those microbes
from invading the inside of the body because if there's a break in the wall
and these bacteria get across and invade the inside of your body and then you're
gonna get an immune attack and your body's going to start creating
antibodies against those cells if some of those cells are pathogens that's a
good thing but what if those cells are your own cells that would be a bad thing
so part of the t-cells are involved in central tolerance which means tolerating
itself in other words it's differentiating itself from a pathogen
it's making sure that we don't end up destroying our own tissue this cell
helps prevent autoimmune conditions now it also works with the T regulatory
cells which has an even greater function of preventing autoimmune diseases and it
also has a suppressive function of suppressing autoimmune diseases and
suppressing hyperinflammatory condition so anything that's too much inflammation
it tends to calm that system down so if there's an infection involved and you go
through this whole infection the T regulatory cells they're also called T
suppressor cells go in there and put the fire out and calm down the infection so
when this cell doesn't work like it should now you're going to get a
movement of bacteria across that intestinal barrier and you're going to
get chronic infection and you're gonna get a lot of inflammation and that's
really what's behind the autoimmune disease but now the question is how do
these cells become over activated well they don't know that but they do know
there's several things involved we know there's usually a microbe involved some
infection by some virus or some other microbe
there's also associations with stress so that could activate cortisol which
also weakens this barrier right here and then we also have malnutrition that
factor and I'm talking about vitamin D now what's so interesting about vitamin
D is that vitamin D helps this cell directly it can help to bring down this
over reaction of this sound and this is why vitamin D even in the 40s was used
for rheumatoid arthritis and I'm talking like 200,000 to 400,000 international
units of vitamin D to put that condition in remission so vitamin D helps to
regulate the T helper cells specifically this one that's involved in autoimmune
disease if you have an autoimmune condition you should be taking vitamin D
and you definitely need to focus in and do research on that area and I have some
real interesting links down below so check them out thanks for watching hey
we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no sugar
totally keto there's no suffering on keto
absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to
check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself
it's just so easy to be keto but is it simple it's super simple
we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

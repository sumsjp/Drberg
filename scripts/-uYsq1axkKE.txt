let's talk about lumbar disc pain
okay now in your little discs
in between your vertebra you have a
couple parts you have the center part
which is a little gel like
center like a jelly and a donut that's
called the nucleus
palposis okay and then you have these
little rings
around that center disc that part is
called the
annulus fibrosis and then on the top of
the disc
in the bottom of the disc you have
vertebral endplates
that connect the disc to the vertebra
okay
now the little center part called a
nucleus palposis
is like a gel and it's composed mainly
of something called proto-glycans okay
now what's
proto-glycans and glycans basically is a
type of carbohydrate
so we have a mixture of protein and a
carbohydrate
and so in that center part of the disc
we have 65 percent
proto-glycans and 15 collagen
which is protein versus the outer
annular fibrosis part
which is mostly collagen okay like 70
collagen and only 20 percent
proto-glycogen
and so the question is why is that in
inside part um
mostly proto-glycogens what's
significant about that
well anytime you have carbohydrates you
have also
the ability to retain more water so one
of the reasons why that center part
needs to be mainly carbohydrate is to
retain some of that fluid
of course there's other reasons too but
that inside needs to be more of a gel
so you can actually move and pivot and
have motion
and this is also why when you wake up in
the morning you're actually
two centimeters taller than when you
went to bed
because this fluid tends to kind of seep
out and then
all that long when you're resting it can
actually come back and you can expand a
little bit
this is also why as you age you get
shorter and shorter because the discs
become dehydrated
and so the outer rings of that disc are
mostly protein because they don't need
to have as much water
they just need to be very very strong to
protect
and keep the gel in the center part to
keep the jelly inside the donut right
and what's really amazing about this
outer ring of this disc
is that it's super super strong it's
actually stronger than
bone but what happens when you have a
herniation is you have this inner gel
part
the jelly starts leaking out and starts
breaking through
the annular next part of the disc
the annular or annulus fibrosis okay so
you can have a protrusion
within the disc that does not extend
and even touch the nerve root at all and
so a herniation can be small enough
where it just breaks
through the next layer of the disc okay
where those little
annular fibers are now when you have
this gel that breaks through
the next layer at first
you won't even feel it you'll have no
pain okay but over time it starts to
degrade
and it becomes inflammatory and
it becomes more acidic and there's nerve
endings
in this little annular part of the disc
and that's where you get pain and i'm
talking about
40 percent of all back pain is
discogenic and that's what they call it
and so this herniation is not even
touching the nerve root
all this pain is occurring within the
disc itself
and normally it should heal but
sometimes it doesn't heal the thing that
you need to know
is there's other reasons why this disc
pain can persist
and there's still a lot of unknowns
about this but i think that most of
these disc problems
originate from a mechanical problem and
then they get worse
with a dietary problem which i'm going
to get into but i remember when i was in
high school
i did something really really stupid i
went to the gym and i started to do
squats okay
and i squatted 425 pounds
without anyone spotting me and i get to
the bottom
and when i pushed off i had so much
force down in my low back
i felt a little shift go on no pain
but a little shift right so i was able
to squat 425 pounds
and i go home that night i go to bed and
i woke up i
could not even get out of bed and so
that was the start of my disc problems
and of course if we add on that all the
other injuries and all the bad
diet stuff that i did i have to still be
very careful
or my low back will start to haunt me
and
and let me know that it's still there
but here's what i think that happens
after the mechanical
initial injury you can then worsen it
with
inflammatory foods okay people with type
2 diabetes and
metabolic syndrome are at risk for disc
herniation okay also chronic
hyperglycemia which means the
consumption of a lot of carbohydrates
over
a period of time starts to create these
um these sticky proteins called advanced
glycated end products which starts to
clog everything up
and create a lot of inflammation a lot
of free radicals
and that can increase the risk of more
herniation
so i think a lot of people with low back
pain have this situation
and what they don't know is that their
diet is contributing
to more disc problems and the prevention
of it healing correctly so having a
protrusion is not simply about
having some fall or injury and then
now you have a disc protrusion it's also
the addition of other inflammatory
factors
so this is what i'm going to recommend
if you have low back pain
and you may find that things just clear
up without the need hopefully of
getting surgery number one eliminate
inflammatory foods
okay i'm talking about sugar i'm talking
about
refined carbohydrates
flour products and vegetable oils
especially
omega-6 fatty acids like corn oil canola
soy cottonseed oil very very important
to eliminate those from the diet
you may find your low back pain clears
right up
number two start doing fasting and
intermittent fasting
okay number three start consuming
omega-3
fatty acids okay fish oils cod liver oil
very very important you want a
one-to-one ratio of omega-3
to omega-6 most people have like a 20
to 1 ratio they have way too many omega
6 fatty acids
and they don't realize that's it's just
killing their back
and their discs and the last thing i
would highly recommend to do would be to
take vitamin d3
at least 20 000 iu's vitamin d is a
natural anti-inflammatory and it can
greatly help your back pain not just
from reducing inflammation
but if you're deficient in vitamin d one
of the first places you're going to
notice
a symptom is in your lower back okay
make sure you take some magnesium with
that because magnesium also
helps relax the muscle around the lower
back
all right thanks for watching hey before
you go

i would love to hear about your success

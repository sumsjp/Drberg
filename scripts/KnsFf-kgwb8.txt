now i think we all know um that exercise does help you live longer
but the question is why that's what i want to dig into today so endurance running okay it's
inner genetics number one acquiring food and number two avoiding being the food
being chased by a tiger right so it's in our genes it's a survival mechanism our genes over time
have adapted to anything increasing our survival okay so when you exercise all sorts of really
cool things happen well let's first look at the number one cause of death on this planet it's
cardiovascular disease so anything done to improve cardiovascular health would extend your life
now there's a very interesting study i'll put the link down below that that compared two things
people that did physical activity versus inactivity okay and they also looked at
all-cause mortality and they found that the group that did physical activity
decreased their mortality by 30 to 40 percent adding an additional five years to their life
so that's pretty cool but why well there's five reasons number one when you exercise you increase
oxygen and oxygen is part of circulation it brings in nutrients it pulls out waste and we know that
hypoxia which is the lack of oxygen creates necrosis it creates death of nerve cells and so
the more oxygen the better the tissues are going to survive all right number two physical activity
decreases inflammation and there's definitely a correlation between inflammation and causing
insulin resistance inflammation and having cancer spread inflammation and more stress on your body
number three increasing parasympathetics now what is the parasympathetics
that's the opposing system to the flutter fight mechanism it's a system that is active when you're
trying to relax and you're trying to sleep and you're trying to digest and so if you're weak in
your parasympathetics you're going to be weak in your recovery so like even when your heart
contracts it contracts and relaxes right you have the contraction which is the sympathetics
and the relaxation is the parasympathetics even when you exercise and then you stop exercising
the parasympathetics kick in there and help calm you down or help her cover you help you
sleep all right number four physical activity decreases insulin resistance and we all know
what that does it increases insulin and insulin resistance is behind probably the majority of
major health problems on this planet and number five physical activity increases growth hormone
growth hormone is activated by several things one would be fasting another one is actually i'm
consuming a moderate amount of protein but when you exercise especially when you do
intense instrument and exercise it will help you spike growth hormone and growth hormone
is the anti-aging hormone so it might be good if you start to include a routine physical exercise
in your busy lifestyle hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here
avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system
i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

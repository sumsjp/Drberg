i want to talk about this white ring that sometimes you see around the cornea of
someone's iris and if this is a dangerous thing is it what does it mean what's the significance of it
mainly you see this in older people in fact you can probably see this in the majority of people
probably even 70 percent of everyone over the age of 80 is going to have this this white ring
around the iris and it's called arcus sunilis and it's nothing really to worry about it's actually
a cholesterol ring what happens as you get older is your ability to oxidize cholesterol is
becomes less and less and less and it can start to accumulate in certain parts of your body
it doesn't mean that your arteries are getting clogged it has nothing to do with that it just
means that you're not fully oxidizing or burning some of the cholesterol and it's backing up
in certain tissues now if you see this in people that are less than 40 years old
then this is something a little different it could mean that you have a problem with
lipids and cholesterol especially ldl and just so you know i'm talking about those people who are
doing a high carb diet and high carbs are being converted into the ldl the bad cholesterol i'm
not talking about the person that gets on keto and goes low carb and ends up having higher amounts of
cholesterol because the type of cholesterol that's involved with that is a completely
different breed and it's not going to be the type that's going to accumulate on your tissues or
inside your arteries i'm talking about usually the person that has high triglycerides high ldl and
they're on a high carb diet but with the most part if you are over 80 years old and you have this
this white ring it's nothing to worry about and it's not something that i would recommend
as far as lowering your cholesterol and start eating low cholesterol foods
but i would recommend getting on a low carb diet and that way your cholesterol profile will be
in check with what it should be all right in summary if you're a little bit older and you
have this white ring i wouldn't worry about it so if you're enjoying my content which i hope you are

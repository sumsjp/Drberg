now when does fasting become starvation let's talk about that
an average non-overweight person is carrying around
about a hundred thousand calories of fat on their body okay 100,000 they're only
carrying around about 1700 calories of stored sugar
but a lot of fat and that's someone that's not even
overweight now let's say that person weighed 150 pounds
okay on average and this is a very rough estimate a person that's 150 pounds
is going to be burning about a thousand to two thousand calories
per day now it could be a little less could be a little bit more but roughly
about between a thousand and two thousand and it really depends on the
person's age their activity level how much muscle
they have there's a lot of variables but let's just take an average 1500
calories okay we divide that by a hundred thousand
we get 67. 67 days of calories to live off of because the
difference between fasting and starving during
fasting you're living off your fat fuel when you're starving
you've already tapped out your fat now you're living off your muscle and
your organ you're turning those two into fuel
so this is a person that is not necessarily overweight like an average
person there are people that have a hundred
pounds of extra fat 200 pounds of extra fat i know one guy
that weighed 600 pounds okay so obviously
they can fast for a lot longer hypothetically
the world record for the person who fasted the longest
it was over a year so really depending on how much fat you have
will determine how long you can fast and it's interesting because some people
kind of freak out if they just eat one meal a day they
think they're going to starve or if they have to fast 48 hours realize
that an average person has a tremendous amount of
potential energy fat calories to survive well before they start to
starve okay so when you're fasting you're not hungry okay when you're
starving you are starving you're very very hungry
when you're fasting you're calm you're serene
when you're starving you're gonna be irritable when you're fasting your be
focused when you're starving you're going to be
almost an apathy when you're fasting you actually spare
muscle so the body protects the muscle okay so it's not going to use that for
fuel when you're starving you start to develop
atrophy of the muscle so you have muscle wasting
and you're also a bit hyperactive when you're fasting you have a lot of energy
when you're starving you are fatigued when you're fasting your body conserves
nutrients when you're starving you create all
sorts of nutritional deficiencies i mean like they're called classical or
major vitamin deficiencies vitamin b1 deficiency which is berry berry
and with that comes all sorts of additional symptoms
pellegra that's a vitamin b3 deficiency scurvy vitamin c deficiency rickets
vitamin d deficiency so you have many many different
symptoms coming up from this when do you know that you're starving
versus fasting well when you start to develop some of these symptoms
subjectively you will know and this whole thing
depends on how much fat that you have to run your body on
and the nutrient reserves and i do recommend
when you fast you take your basic nutrients so you never
have this being a risk factor right here all right there you go thanks for

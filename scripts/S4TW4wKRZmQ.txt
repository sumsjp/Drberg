let's talk about the best supplements for runners okay first one is magnesium one of
the first symptoms of a magnesium deficiency is you get tired easily when you exercise
okay why is that because magnesium is needed in the energy currency of your cell it's called atp
so you have this little energy factory mitochondria that's generating atp all
day long you need magnesium so if you're deficient you're not going to have the full
energy currency so you're going to be kind of tired especially if you exert yourself
so you need enough magnesium all right number two b12 especially if you're a vegan because
most bioavailable forms of b12 come from animal products now exercise in general deplete b12
and so you need enough of it b12 also has a lot to do with making the red blood cell and what does
the red blood cell do it helps you carry oxygen so that's important as well if you ever consider like
a certain type of anemia where you're lacking b12 what are you going to be you're going to be
feeling tired and weak so you need b12 to generate the oxygen carrying capacity through the body
also b12 is involved with nerve muscle interaction and so when you're exercising you're using your
muscles and you're using your nerves you need b12 all right number three green tea has some
really powerful antioxidants and phytonutrients to get rid of the oxidation free radical frenzy
that's going on when you exercise so it's going to eliminate oxidation it's going to help boost
glutathione to get rid of free radical damage which is going to help you recover
and it will increase fat oxidation okay so you're going to be able to have better
performance so green tea is good to take while you're exercising or before actually number four
probiotics and you wouldn't think something from the gut would actually help your exercise
performance but there's some real interesting research it does especially for recovery and also
when you have probiotics you decrease your risk of getting an infection from exercising too much
when you exercise especially long distance running you really put a big stress on your immune system
so probiotics can help to counter some of that number five potassium very very important
because every single cell has what's called a sodium potassium pump and you need 4700 milligrams
of potassium every single day because of so many little pumps in your cells that help you generate
electrical current to activate the nerve muscle interaction so if you're deficient in potassium
what happens is you get all sorts of problems with cramping muscle fatigue and the list goes
on and on potassium is a key electrolyte just like magnesium for your heart as well so it's also very
important in the cardiovascular system as well as keeping your arteries very flexible and soft
number six sodium as in the sodium potassium pump without sodium your muscles get weak
so i know people are concerned about too much sodium you're not going to have any problem
with excess sodium as long as you have enough potassium because these work back and forth
the best source of sodium would be himalayan sea salt okay number seven beta alanine helps increase
something called carnosine by eighty percent and it works in your muscles and this compound
can help you decrease lactic acid which could fatigue the muscle it decreases acidity in
general which causes you to be tired and it increases energy so it's a good supplement
to take if you are a runner all right number eight vitamin d vitamin d is a very powerful
anti-inflammatory but it also has direct effect on exercise performance i put some links down below
also it's very vital for the cardiovascular part of your body in supporting that and there's a
lot of other things that can do as well and lastly vitamin b1 it's a necessary cofactor in the energy
factory in the mitochondria and it's needed uh to um as a spark plug to make the fuel ignite okay so
without enough b1 you're not going to be burning your fuel that well and you're going to be tired
so this is very very important also if someone's doing glucose pure glucose when they're exercising
when they're doing running your demand for b1 goes way up so if you're not taking b1 you won't be
able to use that fuel efficiently and you're going to be tired or you might have other side effects
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

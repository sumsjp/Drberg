i want to talk about the relationship between liver damage and estrogen in men
what is the connection i want to go through different aspects there are quite a few men
out there with liver damage and they don't know it and they're starting to get symptoms
of too much estrogen and anytime you build up too much estrogen you get a decrease in testosterone
so gynecomastia breast tissue is one of the symptoms
red palms is another symptom of liver cirrhosis decreased libido erectile dysfunction
and spider naevie okay which is these little red dots on your skin that have these little tiny like
spider veins and they can be random on the abdomen on your back on your thighs it's just a symptom
that you have too much estrogen you can also start losing body hair your voice can actually get a
little bit higher these are all symptoms that you have too much estrogen compared to testosterone
so we got the liver right here and we have various things that are triggering either a fatty liver or
cirrhosis the thing you need to realize is you don't just end up with cirrhosis one day it takes
years of development and there are different stages before you get there you might have
inflammation and then a fatty liver and then that turns into scar tissue and it's a little bit more
more and more and more and some of these symptoms can develop way before you get actual cirrhosis
itself which is more of an end stage scarring of the liver and when you have scarring of the
liver you have all sorts of things like one thing is called portal hypertension because there's so
much resistance to the liver that the blood the venous blood coming into the liver is backed up
so we're getting this high level of pressure and that creates a lot of other complications
chronic drinking of alcohol is a very common cause of this so no more than
a six-pack on the weekends for that now insulin resistance has now been officially
recognized as a primary cause of cirrhosis and i think probably 65 maybe 70 percent
of the population has this and they don't even know it sometimes because they don't
test it and by the way if you want to get a test for this it's called homa ir okay
homa-ir it's a really good test to determine if you have this right here
it's like a pre-pre-diabetes state diabetes itself can create this
and hepatitis so and there's other causes as well but let's take a look at why estrogen is going up
when the liver is damaged first of all you get impaired detoxification and so the liver is not
able to get rid of the buildup of estrogen because this liver cells are basically dying you don't
have enough of those hepatocytes to deal with this estrogen overload so that's one thing right there
also because the liver is involved with making proteins you'll have altered neurotransmitters
in the brain and there's going to be alteration in dopamine which is then going to increase
prolactin which is a hormone and if you're a guy you don't want a high level of prolactin because
that triggers another hormone in your hypothalamus that eventually triggers other hormones in your
pituitary that will shut down your testosterone levels as well as your production of sperm now
there's also something else in the liver that helps to buffer excessive amounts of certain
hormones it's called sex hormone binding globulin and what that will do if it increases is you'll
get less free testosterone as well as increased estrogen okay so now we have this ratio that's
just completely out of control now if someone is overweight and they have a lot of extra fat
the fat cells can actually make estrogen and there's an enzyme called aromatase in your body
that can also take that last bit of androgen that you have that last bit of testosterone
and convert that into estrogen so as you can see there's a lot of things that can happen
if the liver is not doing its job so don't wait to get diagnosed as a fatty liver or cirrhosis
start cutting down on the alcohol if not get rid of it completely do things to get rid of insulin
resistance i put a link down below if you're new to my channel on that and that will help this
right here and i also have a video on hepatitis i put that link down below as well a couple things
that can help inhibit this enzyme right here cruciferous vegetables i would highly recommend
start consuming a lot of cruciferous vegetables milk thistle is probably one of the best herbs to
strengthen the liver cells themselves and stinging nettle root is another powerful inhibitor of this
enzyme right here so that way we can start to turn things around and increase your testosterone as
you decrease your estrogen hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what
about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

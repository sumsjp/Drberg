so let's talk about iodine what it's good for iodine is a trace mineral a trace mineral is
something you need in very tiny trace amounts okay usually in micrograms but iodine is so important
for your body let's start with the thyroid what does iodine do for your thyroid well the
majority of iodine is located in the thyroid gland why because you need iodine to make the
thyroid hormones when we're talking about t4 or t3 we're really talking about the number of iodine
molecules that are attached to this protein hormone and so what happens is when the thyroid
makes t4 it's that's not the active form that's the inactive form you have about 80 percent
of that t4 being converted to t3 the active form of thyroid hormone through the liver
and 20 percent of this conversion happening through the kidneys okay so t3 is the active form
t4 is the inactive form and you also need selenium for this conversion as well and so without iodine
wow your metabolism suffers pretty much every single symptom relating to
your metabolism so if you have a slow metabolism it can affect your hair your nails your skin your
mood it you can have a buildup of cholesterol you can start gaining weight all over your body
so there could be many many problems including nodules on the thyroid itself
from an iodine deficiency all right number two iodine is essential in protecting you against
excessive amounts of estrogen and so if you're estrogen dominant you have too much estrogen
you're going to need a little more iodine to counter that excess amount i'll give you one
example fibrocystic breast okay where you're having these little nodules in the breast
the most powerful remedy to get rid of those is seek help iodine will counter that so fast
same thing with ovarian cysts iodine is a great remedy because these cysts are
occurring because you have too much estrogen so we need iodine to counter this effect and
so as we know too much estrogen can lead to cancer especially of the breast the ovary
the uterus and even the prostate so iodine is essential to help decrease the risk of cancer in
those areas also when you're pregnant you get this surge of estrogen and this is one of the reasons
why many women end up with a thyroid problem a hypothyroid condition if they don't have enough
iodine when they're pregnant same thing goes with birth control pills hormone replacement therapy
eating non-organic food where you're getting a lot of pesticides that mimic estrogen that can
increase your estrogen too or if you're consuming a lot of soy products or soy milk you can get too
much estrogen and if you don't have iodine that can be a problem all right number three
your cognitive function especially in a growing infant and if that mother is deficient in iodine
while she's carrying the child or she's lactating that child is going to end up with a lower iq
their intelligence is not going to be where it should be very important in brain development if
you're exposed to fluoride fluoride blocks iodine so if your water filter is not blocking fluoride
this could be a problem because you're you're getting too much fluoride that can then block
the absorption of iodine the same thing with bromide or bromate bromate is in flower products
and that can definitely block your ability to absorb iodine now bromate has been banned in most
developing countries except the u.s in fact they don't even put on the label if there's
bromate in that product so if you're a regular follower of me and you're watching my videos
you don't worry about that because you're not consuming breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits
waffles things like that you're not consuming grain but they use this bromate to make the dough
very elastic all right number four iodine reduces the need for insulin so it's involved
with your blood sugars as well all right number five iodine can help you prevent hot flashes
so why we deficient iodine because the soils don't have the microbes
to mobilize these trace minerals including iodine even japan consumes a hundred times more iodine in
their food than the in the us and they have much less risk from getting breast cancer
and less thyroid issues and less estrogen dominance now if you consume too much
cruciferous potentially that can block your iodine but you would have to consume a tremendous amount
over a long period of time and only cruciferous so it's going to be very rare but
if you're concerned about it just take some seek help when you're consuming this cruciferous
now seek help is the best source and also make sure that it's from a very very healthy ocean
but sea kelp not only has the iodine it has all the trace minerals plus amino acids plus vitamins
and also make sure you get an organic source all right thanks for watching

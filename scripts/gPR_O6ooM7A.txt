this is an upgraded video from my last video on shingles so it's some additional information if
you have shingles this is what you need to do okay there's two things one is a
technique i'm going to explain which is very very effective and number two is certain nutrients
number one vitamin d three okay 50,000 international units every single day now you
might say well that's a lot well we're doing short term talking like a week maybe two weeks there's
not any problem with that and you need enough vitamin d to drop inflammation and also help your
immune system the thing about the virus involved with shingles is that it's in a dormant state
and it gets reactivated it can come out of remission and it tends to live in the nervous
system so when it comes out it can give you all sorts of lesions external on the skin and
internal too and create a lot of pain so vitamin d helps immune system keep it in remission
number two zinc that will also help put that virus back on remission i would do 200 milligrams every
single day number three vitamin c now in past videos i always mentioned never to do a synthetic
version except if you're doing a detox here's one other exception if you are handling shingles
you can take at least a gram or or more a few times a day maybe three times a day just make sure
that it's non-gmo because a lot of times they make vitamin c from corn and unless it's gmo you might
have residues of glyphosate if you're taking synthetic vitamin c for any period of time
i would recommend also taking with it a food base about 500 milligrams
of a food-based vitamin c but you need more vitamin c to help put that virus back in remission
another thing to do is get l-lysine it's an amino acid at least 600 milligrams once or twice a day
now l-lysine will be kind of nullified if you take another amino acid called arginine
so um i don't think you're taking arginine right now but i would just recommend avoiding nuts
which is high in arginine and seeds okay so don't consume those right now to keep your arginine low
so l-lysine can work a lot better because they tend to compete and last thing is it takes the
melatonin before bed three milligrams just so happens that melatonin taken short term
can help you as an antiviral okay now what do you do with the technique let's say for example
this is looking on your back let's say you have pain that radiates from your spine
over to your left side through here and it follows like between the ribs what you're
going to do is you're going to use acupressure on the opposite side the mirror image so wherever
it hurts on this side you press and massage on the opposite side so you're going to need some
help with this because you can't reach back there but you want to stimulate this opposing
mirror image neurological pathway so you have someone just rub down and guess what
it's going to be very very tender it's always going to be twice as tender on the opposite side
just have them do it within your tolerance and once you kind of really massage this area and
do some acupressure on this side it's going to relieve the bad side okay and if this is happening
on the front side of your body and do the same thing just press on the opposite side wherever it
is on this side you match it on the opposite side and do that several times a day and it will work
in fact go ahead and comment down below and you're going to notice a lot of people are going to
say wow this works it's amazing because it does work just give it a shot thanks for watching

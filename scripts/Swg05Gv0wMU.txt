this video is very very very important so I would take notes I'm gonna try to
make it really really simple but it's a very important concept you may have
watch other videos with parts of this information but I wanted to create one
video just to explain everything okay so what we're talking about is how to
prevent someone from going from a prediabetic state to a diabetic state
now the difference between prediabetes and diabetes has to do with your blood
Sugar's so in prediabetes your blood sugars are around 100 to 125 diabetes
it's 126 and greater we're talking about another test called a1c which is an
average of three months of your blood Sugar's we're dealing with a 5.7 to a
6.4 with prediabetes and then once you're diabetic becomes 6.5 or greater
so really when we're talking about diabetes type 2 we're just talking about
the elevation of sugar in your blood a normal blood sugar should be about 80
okay and what that means is you have about a
teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood okay so it's not that much and you don't
need to consume a teaspoon of sugar to get that your body will make its own
sugar out of fat out of other types of calories okay
so that's what pre-diabetes is that's what diabetes is now what happens is
this an average person consumes about 31 teaspoons of sugar every single day and
I'm talking about the other carbohydrates that can turn into sugar
as well it's not all just teaspoons of sugar so they're consuming a lot of
carbs roughly could be around I don't know 300 grams or even more for the
average American so that's crazy amounts of sugar now
look at this a normal blood sugar is only one teaspoon of sugar over here
we've got 31 teaspoons so why is it when someone consumes a lot of sugar
the average American why isn't the blood sugar just screaming high all over the
place usually it's normal at least for a
period of time well that is because we have this filter right in the middle of
this thing and it has to do with this machine that keeps the sugar out of the
blood and it's called insulin so insulin kind of filters out and gets rid of the
excess amount of sugar in the blood and what does it do with it it hides it
it'll put it in stored sugar called glycogen in the liver and the muscles it
will also put excess in the fat it will convert some to cholesterol but the
thing that the body doesn't want is high amounts of sugar in the blood why
because that sugar is very very dangerous to the lining of the arteries
it will start to corrode and it's called oxidation or damage inside the arteries
and then comes the plaquing and the calcium and that whole thing so your
body really considers excess sugar very very dangerous if this person is
consuming a lot of carbohydrates and has a high frequency of eating having a lot
of snacks what happens is you're gonna get a huge amount of insulin being
released from the pancreas and that insulin is working really really hard to
keep the sugar down but here's the other thing high levels of insulin is also
very toxic to the body as well so your body doesn't like high amounts of sugar
or high months of insulin so what does it do it starts to reduce the insulin by
creating a resistance okay it's called insulin resistance so the cells start
blocking insulin like crazy the problem is the body still has to keep this under
control so it starts to turn up the dial and produce more and more insulin to
penetrate through this resistance to keep the sugar at a normal level and
this whole game continues for a period of 10 to 15 years so you may have
insulin resistance for 10 to 15 years until all the sudden this pancreas says
you know what it's been compensating it's been working
hard to kind of counter this problem to help you but now it's exhausted so the
pancreas can no longer pump out that much insulin so this starts going down
and down now we don't have as much insulin well guess what's gonna happen
if you keep consuming this amount of carb at this frequency this sugar is
gonna start to go up why because our insulin is going down so the sugar is
gonna start going up over time it's gonna then turn into full-blown diabetes
now understanding this problem is so important if you are a pre-diabetic or
even you have insulin resistance because it's so easy to solve with just a little
bit of effort you can avoid this whole thing and it really has to do with
cutting out the carbs and going on in a minute fasting now the other thing that
I want to tell you is very very interesting the doctors are focused on
the blood sugars only they're not measuring your fasting insulin level
they're not measuring if you have insulin resistance the test that you
would do to determine that would be Homa IR okay but that's never done so this area
is kind of hidden this is the area that you see this happens later in life this
happens way before 90% of people that are pre-diabetics don't even know their
pre-diabetics they just wake up one day and they're a diabetic now I would say
probably 99% of the people don't know they have insulin resistance now I'm
going to tell you right now the symptoms to determine if you have insulin
resistance even without taking this test okay
all you have to do right now is just look down and see if you see your belly
if you see your belly and you can't see your your feet that we know you have
insulin resistance here are some other symptoms
frequent urination even at night are you getting up to the night in urinating
this is you have if you were just to change your
diet you would notice this symptom improving within a few days brain fog
memory problems because your brain is dependent on this glucose and when you
have resistance guess what you starve the neurons with its fuel and you start
becoming forgetful it's the start of dementia but when you cut out the carbs you'll be
running your body on ketones and you can bypass that whole thing and feed your
brain and you'll actually have a lot more focus and less memory problems but
here's the big symptom right here to know that you have instant resistance
you cannot go a long period of time without getting hungry you need a snack
between meals you need a snack at night this is probably the big one craving for
carbs is a big one or chips or some type of cracker especially at night is a big
symptom tired after eating you want to take a nap after your lunchtime we know
you have insulin resistance tingling in the feet or burning in the feet or any
type of sensation in the hands of the feet is right in this area right here it
could be this area too that means that your blood sugars are destroying the
vascular system the capillaries to the nerves in your feet that's called
peripheral neuropathy very very very very simple to fix all you do is you get
off the high carb diet stop eating so frequent I put some links down below of
how to do this and just so you know sugar is very oxidative and it creates a
lot of inflammation and the inflammation actually even makes this worse
it actually can push you from here to here just having the inflammation also
omega-6 fatty acids like in all the different oils soy oil corn oil
cottonseed canola oil those are very highly inflammatory that can also push
you over the edge as well as msg like monosodium glutamate it's in a lot of
fast food restaurants anyway I gave you a lot information I hope you now have a
deeper understanding of really how simple this
concept is thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains no
sugar totally keto there's no suffering
on keto absolutely not Karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely you
have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and
make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto
but is it simple it's super simple we hope you enjoy making it as much as we
are enjoying eating it

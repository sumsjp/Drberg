you know vitamin d is a very interesting vitamin it's not really a vitamin it's a hormone
but today i want to talk about the 10th reason why you may be deficient in vitamin d so there's a lot
of reasons why people are deficient vitamin d it could be diet they're not consuming enough fatty
fish olive oil in fact it's almost impossible to get your vitamin d requirement from the diet
you're indoors you're not on the sun that could be a reason you're getting older as
you age your skin gets thicker and you have less absorption of vitamin d through the skin
it could be your skin color because the darker the skin the more melanin in your skin which blocks uv
light which reduces the absorption of vitamin d and then number five obesity the more weight you
have on your body the less vitamin d you're going to be able to absorb number six metabolic syndrome
this includes diabetes high blood pressure insulin resistance number seven inflammation if you have a
lot of inflammation in your body you're not going to be able to absorb very much vitamin d number
eight malabsorption and this also includes a lack of bile or let's say you had your gallbladder
removed you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin d too well number nine infection when you
have infections whether viral or bacterial that's going to inhibit your vitamin d absorption and
number 10 the focus of this video is polymorphism now what is that that is a mutation or alteration
in the genes that control the vitamin d receptor and there's six known mutations or variations
of this gene and you can get your genes tested to see if you have any of these
that's in another video but if you have polymorphism what's happening is you have the
vitamin d that's supposed to be traveling through your blood to connect to the vitamin d receptor
the problem is we have resistance in the receptor right now and so because vitamin d
is like a message or communication it won't really matter how much vitamin d
or how much communication is flowing through your bloodstream it really matters if that
communication is being received right if you were to talk to someone who is ignoring you
that has earplugs who alters what you're trying to communicate who doesn't understand what you're
trying to communicate you can have vast problems with that right well the exact same thing happens
in the body with vitamin d if the vitamin d receptor can't receive that communication
you're going to be deficient regardless of how much vitamin d communication that's trying to send
over through the blood now what's very interesting about this topic is that vitamin d receptors
are located in most of your body tissue okay so they are all over the place and this is why
vitamin d is so so important in mineral metabolism metabolic pathways including your immune cells
you have vitamin d receptors in almost all of your immune cells vitamin d and its receptors
also involved in glucose and insulin metabolism so if you have this defect
in the vitamin d receptor gene all sorts of things can happen you can get rickets that's a vitamin d
deficiency in children where your legs are bowed and we have all sorts of skeletal malformations if
you're an adult you can get osteoporosis or like a precursor to osteoporosis which is osteopenia
hair loss and i'm talking about alopecia which is an autoimmune disease that's definitely related
to this problem with the vitamin d receptor susceptibility to viruses why because vitamin
d is essential to your immune system liver inflammation vitamin d is probably one of the
most potent natural anti-inflammatories around so if you don't have enough anti-inflammatories
the liver gets more inflamed it's more susceptible to inflammation and then fibrosis
cirrhosis a fatty liver insulin resistance etc and polymorphism is also related to the autoimmune
diseases ms lupus hashimoto's as in hypothyroidism type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis
and insomnia so what can we do about this well if we have the receptor that's resistant to vitamin d
well you can take higher amounts of vitamin d that will actually help but there's also another
thing that's very interesting about activating the vitamin d receptor we have the different
versions of vitamin d and bile salts bile salts can activate the vitamin d and i've done a lot of
videos on this and i recommend bile salts with a lot of different conditions and that is probably
why it's very effective in enhancing the vitamin d message to be able to be understood or received in
order for the vitamin d to be more receptive and do its various functions and this includes also
secondary bile salts let me explain what that is you have primary bile salts which are
created by your liver that come down through the bile ducts and get stored in the gallbladder but
the secondary bile salts are made by your friendly microbes so this gives another dynamic and another
area to focus on because if you don't have all the friendly bacteria in the right amounts in order
to make the secondary bile salts that could be another missing link of why you might have various
health problems so if you're struggling with any of the conditions that i mentioned you may want to
take more vitamin d as well as purify bile salts hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

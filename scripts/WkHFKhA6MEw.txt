not sure if you knew this or not but curcumin is very poorly absorbed now what is curcumin
that is the main polyphenol or phytonutrient in the spice turmeric now curcumin has some
seriously powerful antioxidant properties and it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory
it's very effective in exercise-induced inflammation muscle soreness exercise recovery
all the arthritises both osteo and rheumatoid it's also good for your
mood like in anxiety it's been shown to be very effective in metabolic syndrome
and it's also effective in degenerative eye conditions like glaucoma cataracts problems
with your retina and it's very popular around the world india uses it in all their curries
the u.s just sells supplements in thailand they use it in cosmetics in china they use it as a
colorant to color certain things because of the pigment in korea they use it in a drink
malaysia they use it as an antiseptic pakistan they use it as an anti-inflammatory in japan you
can find it in a tea but the question is why does it absorb that well well because it's fat soluble
so unless you're taking in a certain way you're not going to probably absorb as much as you think
there are three things that can help you increase the absorption the first one is to add another
phytonutrient from black pepper called piperine you want to consume that at the same time so a lot
of times when you're taking curcumin it's already coming with this black pepper extract piperine
which will increase the absorption by 2 000 now the next thing you can do to increase absorption
is to consume it with some fat it can be fat from an avocado it can be fat from your meals from
your meats from eggs it doesn't matter but anytime you're taking a fat soluble vitamin whatever it is
you're going to absorb more of it if you take it with a fat and the last thing you can do is you
can heat it slightly this is why when you're using in a hot tea or maybe a curry the heat if it's not
overdone can actually activate more of this vital nutrient and if you haven't seen my other video

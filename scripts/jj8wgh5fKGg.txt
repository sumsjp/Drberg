let's discuss the side effects of not consuming breakfast what would happen
you might be at risk for high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes gaining weight developing a
slow metabolism and let's not fail to mention you might be overeating at lunchtime or dinner because
we all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day right in fact i used to promote it
in my first book that i put out i did my research and i found even harvard university said that you
need to consume a breakfast meal or you're going to have a lot of negative health consequences
including craving carbs later in the day so where did this idea actually come from well
it all just came from a lobbyist group starting late 19th century which is basically a fear
campaign to get you to eat more cereal and bacon in fact in my first book i was the guy
that would tell you that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and you should
definitely not skip it and i remember reading some research on them even by harvard university
that said that if you don't consume your breakfast you're going to crave carbohydrates late at night
so it just goes to show you that when you have a fixed idea you're very unwilling to look at
other viewpoints in fact even myself i had to have several people over course of years show me
that consuming breakfast is not the best idea before i actually could change my mind about it
i think changing someone's mind about something if they have a fixed idea is a very difficult
thing if not impossible but back in the late 1800s there was a man by the name of harvey kellogg who
was known for his cornflakes right i mean back then i'm sure cornflakes was a lot different
than it is now with the frosted cornflakes but i think he started the famous battle creek
sanitarium in michigan and they would do all sorts of things from exercise
low fat low calorie meals enemas low protein whole grain especially whole wheat nuts plenty of sun
and there are sanitariums all over the world on top of mountains in switzerland where you had this
cold fresh mountain air and at that time before antibiotics you had tb and so they were trying
to deal with tb which was a lung condition a bacterial infection that affected your lung
so this idea that breakfast is the most important meal in fact that you need it is completely
100% false let's take a look at the real side effects that could occur if you were to skip a
breakfast and i'm going to put a link down below of exactly how to do it correctly
number one you're going to start losing weight number two you have much less of an appetite
you'll have mental clarity you'll have a faster metabolism because you are going to fast longer
and you're going to improve insulin resistance which is going to end up giving you better
blood sugars you have less cravings definitely better mood and less of a metabolic syndrome so
all those risk factors that they told you that you're going to get if you skip your breakfast
is the exact opposite if you skip your breakfast you'll actually prevent these problems hey before

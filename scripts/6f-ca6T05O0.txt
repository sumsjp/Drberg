welcome everyone have a special guest
today uh sarah g is with us
and he has a just an amazing website
it's called green med info.com i've been
going to that website for a long time in
fact that's where i do a lot of research
on because he just has a com a
compilation of so much research on
natural remedies i mean it'll just make
your head spin i think there's probably
i think it's over 10 000 articles at
least so
welcome welcome and thanks for being on
thank you for having me dr berger i
appreciate your work and you helping
spreading empowering information to the
world uh great job on that
hey thanks
so um
let's talk about uh several things i
would like to talk about
definitely garlic um in relationship to
because i when i did research on garlic
on your site there's just like a
you have a massive
catalog of things like every different
angle of what it does
um
let's first talk about garlic because
it's just a it's a interesting topic so
what what what uh what's the some of the
benefits of garlic on our body thank you
yes i love the topic of garlic because i
love it as a culinary addition to my
life
but when it comes to the research on it
in fact
last time i checked there were 6 000
plus articles on pubmed describe right
describing its many benefits so
over the past decade i've done some
indexing of the research and we have
about 500
conditions that have been studied
indicating that it could benefit them
across 100 plus distinct pharmacological
actions you know like cardio vascular
protection antioxidants
hypotensive all these great
ways of expressing the benefits so for
me i've always been just marveling at
how
in the past spices and herbs were
worth their weight in gold at times and
now i know why because the research is
so clearly showing that you know they do
provide really solid evidence-based
alternatives to many of the conventional
approaches that um are absolutely
life-saving within a certain context but
i prefer culinary medicine where it's
preventive small delicious doses daily
and then you hopefully don't need some
kind of heroic procedure down the
line
right
right there's a
very recently
i'm not sure if
uh like obviously you know about uh i
guess it's allison right allison is the
one of the compounds exactly um
now what's interesting is um there's a
enzyme called scot
that's the short short name for it but
um
but what it does is that
if someone develops damage to the
mitochondria and they get cancer
allison acts as an um a blocker for
scott to feed the cancer
and as i was researching that it was
just
trying to break down the chemistry and i
had to really just almost like draw it
out but um
i'm like wow that is the reason that's
one of the one of the modes that it
actually can address cancer is it blocks
the actual fuel
to the cancer cell itself so but it's a
it's a salvage pathway so in other words
um
you can use other compounds to block it
but there's like a back door if if the
cancer needs food it uses back door and
garlic actually has a compound that
blocks that back door
so
that's the most recent thing i was
involved with but uh but go ahead tell
me some of the other things yeah well
let's refirm what you're saying um
actually right now we have uh
identified 19 different cancers that
garlic has been studied to
at least on an experimental level appear
to prevent and or have a therapeutic
effect against
and
part of it is its selective cytotoxicity
it's a very common thing within natural
compounds for them to be able to exhibit
what almost looks like a rudimentary
type of intelligence they can
target the cancer stem cell which is
technically maybe one in every 1000 to
10 000 cells in a tumor is actually
capable of causing new
tumor coordination so
that specific cell type is so often
called called the sort of heart of
cancer malignancy is targeted by these
compounds and yet the healthy tissue
remains on intact whereas a lot of
conventional chemotherapy and radiation
is not
selective so there's a lot of collateral
damage so that's one of the things that
i find most exciting about garlic for
that use
wow so it's it doesn't mess with your
normal cells it goes after the abnormal
cells um does it
does it basically cause the cell to
commit suicide is that how it kills it
or what does it do
that appears to be what is most
consistent in the literature that i've
looked at which is that exactly it's um
inducing programmed cell death versus
let's say a cell gets harmed through
an exposure to a toxicant or an injury
it's necrotic and then having to break
down all of that
cell
debris can cause a lot of damage and
confusion within the immune system
whereas programmed cell death is just
this gentle disassembly of the cancer
cell which once was immortal couldn't
stop proliferating and now it's like
okay i'm being reminded i'm part of this
whole body and i'm going to leave now
and then healthy tissue will replace me
and that's the beauty again of these
sorts of natural compounds
that's fascinating
is there
some importance is there a great
importance of having it
like fresh garlic versus
fermented versus
caps and capsules freeze-dried do you
have any data on that
yeah there's a lot of research on the
differences and i believe that
interestingly even in some cases cooked
garlic may have even higher antioxidant
activity than non-cooked garlic
so there's a lot of counter intuitive
dimensions to the topic but i will say
that i think just generally speaking
um and this is something that stephanie
saneff uh senior researcher at mit she
constantly is bringing to light is that
there's sort of a sulfur deficiency in
the western diet
and some of it has to do with soil
quality but it really has a lot to do
with a lack of things like organosulfur
containing garlic and then cruciferous
vegetables so it may be that in many
cases of cancer it's another example of
there's a deficiency of a very basic
vital compound that we you know had in
our diet for really literally thousands
of generations and then now it's gone
and so the body is
expressing an imbalance not so much a
pre-programmed
code of death within the cells which is
unfortunately the way sometimes cancer
is perceived
interesting
so um
does it have any properties like
cruciferous vegetables in dismantling
carcinogens like environmental pollution
i'm not sure
yes i do believe that if you look at the
research on sulfur containing compounds
they are essential in helping to
activate the toxic detoxification
pathways which are the phase one and two
enzyme systems so the sulfur-containing
compound helps with uh glucoronidation
as i recall which helps to render
fat-soluble or lipophilic toxicants
water-soluble so they can be eliminated
through you know say the kidneys
so there's definitely something about
how
these uh categories support our natural
detoxification process
interesting
yeah and so um so you have a lot of also
date on the cruciferous vegetables i
mean you have tons and tons of data on
that uh with also
cancer
it infects cancer big time i mean you
have
radishes you have
kale
i mean there's some huge effects on
killing cancer directly right
yeah it's interesting because as i
explored the topic you know more in
depth i discovered that it almost
appears as if
in the new model of understanding food
you know it's not just building blocks
for the body machine you know lipids and
proteins and carbohydrates and
micronutrients nor is it just fuel for
the body but food is a form of
inflammation and literally contains
within it these little packets
of nanoparticles which which include
exosomes actually that contain within
them
micrornas which are non-coding rna
sequences now known to super being and
control the expression of the majority
of the protein coding genes in the human
genome so technically they're like
master regulators and they're actually
found outside of us in certain foods so
now the new view of
things like chronic diseases especially
heart disease and cancer is that we may
be seeing deficiencies of essential
information carrying molecules from from
ancestral foods
as being the cause of what otherwise
would be conceived as you know arbitrary
chaotic genetically based uh causes of
disease
so so this is acts as an epigenetic
factor right it's actually
expressing it actually can activate or
express certain genes or suppress other
genes
exactly yes beyond the control of the
coating genes are those factors in our
lifestyle our diet that are also found
now in foods it's also known as
nutrigenomics where you have this
information
content within food that then modulates
the expression of our genes
and it's kind of revolutionary because
now we understand why you know grandma
said eat your greens and it's essential
for your health and now we can kind of
understand it's more than just vitamins
there's actually
a means by which we regulate the
epigenetic and genetic integrity of our
entire
body and that's actually based on what
foods we do and do not eat
so just for those of you that are
listening that are maybe new to this
topic you have the genes which are
they're not set in stone i mean they
have certain programs that can turn on
and off but then you have something
above that that controls that called
epigenetics that could be environment it
could be stress it could be your
just your your attitude
your emotional attitude it could also be
foods and we're talking about
cruciferous and garlic that have
huge obviously epigenetic factors on
turning on certain genes of your own
body so it's that's actually a that's
very very fascinating actually
um
you know when i was in practice um
we would put people
instead of like
when i was first starting out i didn't
really know too much about cruciferous
and things because
i was i would just put people in a detox
i would give them high potency herbs to
detoxify their body and they would
always get sick for two weeks they'd end
up with a
lung infection or
mucus coming out and so
later on i found out why that was
occurring and i just want to share that
with those people that
you know wanted to do a detox or
something you have to sometimes be
careful because
even powerful herbs can actually um
break open bacteria
and viruses and release endotoxins
that can go into the liver and create um
a
blockage of the bile ducts that's what
it does and so now you have this
bile duct that's backed up and the bile
if the bile backs up to these little
ducts
it's it's uh it's like a detergent it's
very irritating to the liver and that's
where you get this inflammatory reaction
and you get sick
and so
what i eventually started doing is um
before i start
a person on a detox i would give them
purified bile salts and uh uh the one i
would use a lot would be called top tut
cup
t-u-d-c-c-a tut-cut i think it's uh
and um
that actually is kind of a
similar chemistry to
an ancient remedy that um that goes way
back which is
bear bile oh yeah
and so
apparently that that has been used all
over in uh asia and uh europe but not
too much in america but if you took that
you would find that it opens up the
ducts just opens up your bile ducts and
it just allows for drainage and so you
don't you don't get any detox reactions
any negative
and so
you know people online all the time are
there they're talking about oh i have
a disorder with uh
pancreatitis
gallbladder problems
and that's really just because the bile
has become thickened where maybe they're
trying to detox and everything kind of
backs up but
if you take bile salts on an empty
stomach you can just keep that flow
draining it's such a simple
remedy but only if you know about it you
know
absolutely yeah there's so many foods
that i know of that have this choleric
effect when the bile gets really sticky
and that cholestasis right yeah it could
be very basic things like cumin from
turmeric or you know even garlic
actually i think has that effect so
uh it's amazing but
food and these these ancient remedies
are still the best medicine in some
cases
yeah i think i think you're right in
probably most cases
um
hey what about um
um
turmeric i know that's that's a very uh
hot topic now what
what is so special about that
well that's one of those herbs that i
was just blown away by because when i
started agreement info in 2008 and i
went down into the rabbit hole of this
sea of information on pubmed i think at
the time there were 25 million citations
there
i saw at the time about 8 000 studies on
the benefits of turmeric and i spent
almost what was it almost a year
indexing all the research for agreement
info on the topic
so right now we have over 850 diseases
that are indexed having been studied to
potentially be benefited from this herb
and
what i found was that
it has such a broad range of benefits
for humans that it almost indicated to
me that it wasn't an accident you know
how can one herb right have so many
benefits for so many conditions that
plague humans
and it turns out when i went deeper down
the rabbit hole like with garlic and
like with tumeric they're both part of
the angiosperm flowering plant family
which now
sub 10 70 percent of the world's food
production still
and it turns out evolutionarily speaking
about 200 years ago our ancestors
started to collaborate with this
super family of
food bearing
plants and what happened i think is that
in order to benefit
itself
it basically started producing all these
compound
compounds that protected our health and
vice versa and it is you know isn't
amazing because like you think about
these fruit-bearing
plants actually are giving us their
seeds and giving us nutrition so we can
help to disperse those
and we in in turn get all these benefits
to our own reproductive fitness and
health so it's almost like this
co-evolution or
it's almost like a love affair written
into our dna now that's the way at least
i look at it yeah
it's a cold ben it's a it's a good
exchange i mean they're exchanging all
these natural anti anti-disease
compounds and we get to help them
survive by spreading their survival
around to other locations so yeah that's
actually an amazing
uh amazing thing i
and so it's um
that that they would actually
provide this and they just basically
well i'll tell you what i'm going to
create a compound that will help you
with this and anti-inflammatory and to
regulate your blood sugars how about
that then when you spread up spread my
survival i'm like
sure
yeah well what struck me uh dr berg was
there was all this research on uh okay
ovarectomy induced models of menopause
and osteoporosis in the animal model
they would basically take the ovaries
out of the female animals and they would
develop full-blown osteoporosis and
menopausal symptoms but if you gave one
group
pomegranate or plum or orange or grape
it was as if none of those things had
happened it's as if they maintain
longevity and youthfulness
and it turns out that if you look at
pomegranate for example it's the
fruiting ovary of the pomegranate plant
and if you cut it right in half it
literally looks like a mammalian ovary
i know it's like a little clue there hey
hello you know look look at the picture
it's like a
cosmic wink and what's even crazier is
that it has steroidal hormones that are
practically bioidentical to
testosterone as well as is it estrone
one of the three types of estrogen in
mammals so it literally is a form of hrt
and it functions as a replacement ovary
and then in the multicultural lore that
humans have come up with over time it's
used for you know regeneration
youthfulness and it's just you know sort
of amazing
isn't that
funny i mean you have like the walnut
right it's kind of shaped like a brain
exactly i think there's some properties
in there for your brain yes there's a
precursor for like omega-3 fatty acids
it's ala
and then you
i mean there you also have like even in
the
the kidney bean there's a uh
i think it's an enzyme arginine that
detoxifies uh ammonia
um
if your kidneys are i didn't even know
that wow that's amazing okay
kitty bean tends to look like a kidney
doesn't it it does or flax seed's a
great example okay so it's um looks like
an epithelial cell
which is what a good portion of our
tissue is comprised of including breast
and prostate tissue and then it has
mucologinous gel so just like our
elementary canal and all that tissue
you know it produces this soothing
mucous like substance and then it
actually is the most uh studied of all
intervention for epithelial cancers so
for prostate and breast cancer it is
just amazing how much research
accumulated on it for prevention and
even prevention of recurrence of these
cancers so it is very poetic that nature
made it so obvious
yeah it's almost like um
it's so it's so obvious that sometimes
people will miss it like you know if it
looks like
this organ maybe it's good for you um
now what about the um
anti-viral properties of garlic
yeah that's an interesting topic because
recently i went down the rabbit hole of
trying to understand the difference
between
extracellular vesicles
also known as
exosomes and viral particles because
initially exosomes were described as
viral like particles and now some really
top virologists are stating they think
that many viruses because technically
even by conventional definition they
don't live outside of us anyway they're
obligate parasites and they're comprised
of host tissue but the point is is that
they're
indistinguishable from these natural
nanoparticles that our cells produce to
communicate uh between our own body
cells and then individuals within a
group
so
so i've always been trying to figure
that out well why is it that in the
viral infection model
you you can give garlic and it has these
profound like anti-epstein-barr virus
properties and anti um you know herpes
effects
so i think one alternative explanation
is that it increases the integrity and
health of the cell and as cells
naturally degrade in their health they
actually undergo
a process of either necrosis or program
cell death and that's sometimes called
apoptotic bodies that are created and
those apoptotic bodies look like viral
particles and act like them and even
contain the same genetic sequences that
we identify
as being viral so i know that's a very
confusing answer i'll just say that if
you are
trying to fight a viral infection and
you use something like garlic
it has been found to be effective in in
various studies so whether or not it's
eliminating these viral particles or
just helping your immunity or cells
regain resilience i probably say that
would be my my preferred explanation
that's actually very interesting i'll
have to dive into that at some point too
i mean i'll i'm the same way i'll i'll
start um going down a rabbit hole and
then next eight hours later
i'm like
oh my gosh i need to get some work done
i just you know just completely dove off
the edge on something
um i have to have a several medical
dictionaries because uh some of the
stuff is just like so
so heavy
heavy data
um
you know i
you have all this research on your your
site um
what
i know it's like
you probably have to be selective on
this answer but um out of everything out
of every natural
plant or
remedy or whatever what would be um
would you consider like the top of the
list that would give the greatest
benefit with the least amount of harmful
effects would it be garlic i don't know
that's a really good
question you know lately
um i've been thinking a lot about
raw food sources of you know sort of
like energizing the system because
of the discovery that there are these uh
so-called meristematic cells
which are technically immortal
they can replicate
forever in fact they're not that
different from the cells in our germline
cell lines which are you know our sperm
and our egg if you're a woman which are
byproducts of an infinite number of
replication cycles going back to the
last universal common ancestor believed
to have existed around 3.4 billion years
ago that that lineage has never stopped
replicating so within mortal beings
there's actually in a more a threat of
immortality it's a paradox but it's true
it's very conventional biological
science so when you eat raw food i think
the benefits aren't so much from getting
the enzymes but by consuming the
meristematic cells there is a certain
type of energy and information that's
transferred to the body that can cause a
complete regenerative cycle to be
induced
so that means that you could probably
just eat something raw that's from a
plant preferably organic or biodynamic
daily and preferably with each meal and
i think that would be my primary
advocacy for health and wellness but if
i were to go and search through the
database of agreement info quickly and
look at the most compelling
if you will
regenerative
allies it would be turmeric it would be
green tea
it would be resveratrol
cacao
and then probably i would add in again
something from the cruciferous family uh
because those those foods are so
profoundly researched as being
beneficial to humanity that
i feel like you know once you see all
the research you're like oh i really
need to be consuming these things at
least sometime during the week if i want
to live a long and healthy life right um
you said uh that that that part of it's
that a word that i wasn't familiar with
what was the name of the uh that uh kind
of uh
that word that describes uh
without um
immortal cells yeah um the
apical or meristematic cells they're
meristematic yeah
would it mirror stamatic meristematic
yeah it's a type of stem cell that if
you look at say the cover of my book
regenerate i have a romanesca
cauliflower on it that amazing fractal
you know and at the top of the curd at
the top of the spiral is this little
population of stem cells which are
literally transducing from what i
believe is the quantum
vacuum which is a plenitude it has near
infinite amount of energy and
information
a near limitless amount of biomass
so so it's it's actually doing this 24 7
and that cell line doesn't seem to be
prone to error even though it's
replicating which is itself
kind of a miracle if you think about the
way we conceive of you know the entropic
world that supposedly biological systems
are subject to so there's a neg entropy
constant going on and and that type of
cell i believe is why there are cases in
you know the sort of like history around
people living to way beyond like the
theoretical maximum of 130 years of age
maybe 20 200 years or longer and and the
lore around some of these individuals is
that they consumed wild herbs and you
know they're living by consuming
um energy directly from the vacuum you
know the sort of the quantum field and i
think that i actually cover this in my
book because there's a lot of compelling
research on this um
so you know that's a whole nother spin
to things but i i do think the raw food
has a certain magic and mystery to it
that we can take advantage of
you know you know what really sucks is
that you have these
these cancer cells that become immortal
so here you have the cell
ourselves you know leave to a certain
point almost so you have this darn
cancer cell that oh you get to live
forever okay well that's not fair i mean
it's just like they lose that
that program
and so it's kind of i guess it's a lower
level harmonica of what you're talking
about well that's a great example
because that was actually in part the
inspiration behind my writing of the
book regenerate because the largest part
of the book is actually on cancer
because cancer is actually
a representation of the immortality
that's embedded within
the human body yeah only it's the shadow
expression because for example whenever
a smoker smokes a cigarette the
epithelial lining of the arteries gets
damaged there's a recruitment of you
know endothelial progenitor cells and
other stem cells to constantly heal that
area up so what happens over time
because even the cytokines released to
cause the proliferation are similar to
cancer
cytokines is that there is an exhaustion
of the stem cell reserve and
at some point epigenetically the cells
lose
their sense of where to go in the body
it might be like oh i'm i'm a heart cell
but i'm going to go to the kidney you
know it starts to lose its context so
technically
the
immortal immortality and the power that
is accessed by these stem cells which is
similar to what i was referring to in
the plants with the meristematic cells
is a representation of the infinite
immortal energy that actually we have
access to but due to
preventable often exposures from
non-native emf and toxicants and
constant psychogenic stress on our
physiology things can go awry
so
but is a really good example that you
pointed out
um
[Music]
tell me what your viewpoint is on this
um
you know the cancer cells when the cells
become damaged they
they adapt
for survival
there's a um obviously an ancient
program
that's tapped into which is the cancer
cell this is just what
i don't know what i'm i found i don't
know
if it's 100 true but it's just
it's like a backup it's a plan b to
survive and that old program
was very basic yes and it uh ran in a
different type of fuel uh didn't need
oxygen and it just basically
starts to it's really rugged and it
loses it you know it's it's almost like
what you said probably back then there
was not a um
a mortality uh that wasn't programmed in
there
so it was like original
original type
um
that's amazing yeah you're referring to
a explanation which is that cancer is a
representation of
the body basically taking advantage of
an ancient genetic tool kit that's
to by default bury deep within sort of
the programs of the cell
and the default state of the cell is
immortality
um metazoa complex animal life which
again emerged around 250 million years
ago made a deal with itself if you will
that somatic cells would perish but the
germline cell still remains immortalness
passed on of course through the zygote
so
but the the cancer cell is a
representation of the fact that when
conditions in the environment become so
toxic and so unnatural
ultimately that ancient program is
reinvoked and then because it ultimately
will take the host down it's it's
obviously not
suitable but it is actually the instinct
of the body to try to heal that is even
behind recruiting that ancient program
so it's a way in a way of understanding
that cancer isn't just some inexorably
lethal chaotic force out there some
boogeyman but it's something the body
does in response to conditions that are
not optimal and in fact i like to say
you know we know cancer isn't caused
from a lack of chemotherapy or radiation
but it is caused by a lack of certain
foods containing certain information and
certain compounds so it could be
cruciferous with sulforaphane or garlic
with allicin
and or it could be the lack of the
micrornas needed within certain foods in
order to continue to properly regulate
the expression of genes and
interestingly micrornas are technically
transcriptionally they silence the
expression of certain genes so those are
often
oncogenes or cancer associated genes
that micrornas suppress
so plant foods berries
things like this almost universally seem
to be able to silence certain
cancer-related genes
fascinating
and so what um how can people find out
about you you have um your website is it
you have the main website right yeah
greenmaninfo.com we have a free
newsletter and it's a database that's
open source so anyone can go in and
search the 60 000 plus um abstracts that
are indexed across 10 000 health topics
so they can just type it in and
hopefully get the information they need
wow that's awesome well thank you so
much i'll put a link down below and i
really appreciate that
thank you so much i appreciate you
having me on
absolutely

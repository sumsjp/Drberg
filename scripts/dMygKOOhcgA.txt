let's talk about the best spices and herbs for rheumatoid arthritis now
what's the difference between a spice and an herb herbs are the leaf's flowers
and stems of plants spices are the seeds the fruit the root in the bark of plants
now rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease which means that your
own immune system is attacking itself mainly the joints it's called the
synovial joints and you have a lot of inflammation going on and it's really
your own immune system that's creating all the damage all the inflammation
involved is creating a lot of collateral damage to your joints including free
radical damage because the immune system is making a mistake it's attacking its
own tissue instead of the pathogen or the virus or the microbe so with
rheumatoid arthritis you really have a big problem with the t-cells there's a
couple different types of T cells the helper T cell and the killer T cell that
is doing a lot of destruction to your joints not to mention the antibody
attacking the joint but there's also another T cell called the T suppressor
cell another name would be the T regulatory cell that is supposed to turn
off this immune reaction it's supposed to calm the fire and I think that is
where the bigger problem is your immune system is not balancing this reaction so
by using certain spices and herbs you can not just decrease the inflammatory
process which is creating all the damage but you can also strengthen the immune
system you can also improve the antimicrobial function if there's some
chronic infection there but let's just go through the list number one we have
ginger ginger has a very potent effect of lowering leukotriene and these are
one of the weapons that your immune cells use to kill pathogens so ginger
can help reduce that time is an herb it's antimicrobial it's a very powerful
antioxidant then we have turmeric antiinflammatory a very powerful
anti-inflammatory it also reduces the free radicals that are creating all the
damage cinnamon is known to decrease c-reactive protein which is involved in
the inflammatory process garlic is probably one of the most potent anti
microbials antiviral it's definitely an antioxidant then we get number six black
pepper which decreases cytokines cytokines do several things they're
communications but as far as this cytokine we're talking about
inflammatory compound so black pepper is an anti-inflammatory then we have one of
my favorites oregano now regular will decrease several weapons that the immune
cells use to kill pathogens now other things you can do for rheumatoid
arthritis that are essential is start to increase your potassium there's some
very interesting data that if you can increase your potassium up to five
thousand or even six thousand milligrams a day you can really reduce a lot of the
symptoms from rheumatoid arthritis so that's something you might want to try
also decreasing your sugar consumption of course I'm talking about keto is very
important and I will put a link down below of a video to show the
relationship between sugar and the immune system very important going on a
fast is one of the best things you can do for any autoimmune condition
especially rheumatoid arthritis vitamin D is the other key factor in that
because vitamin D is a powerful anti-inflammatory it's involved in just
about every immune reaction so vitamin D in higher levels is vital I'm talking
about 20 30 40 50 thousand I use but if you did that you'd probably experience
some really good relief from rheumatoid arthritis also avoiding any type of
vegetable oils like corn oil soy oil canola cottonseed they're omega-6 fatty
acids very inflammatory alright guys thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains

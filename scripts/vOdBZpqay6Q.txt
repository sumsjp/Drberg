so today we're going to diagnose
health care okay so what's missing in
health care it's the health part i know
it's ironic you go to the doctor get
healthy but there's really no health
there and the reason is because only 25
of all medical schools even require you
get even one class of nutrition and
those 25
that do requirement required only get
about between 11 and 20 hours of
training and nutrition i'm sorry that's
just not enough so what do they do they
refer to the dietitian so what do the
dietitians do they analyze the diet and
they recommend certain foods right
but did you realize that
they're continuing educational credits
that they have to go to every
year is sponsored by the food
and beverage
companies yeah the food manufacturing
companies if you go to a website called
beverageinstitute.org i'll put a link
down there
you will find
coca-cola
has this website and it's in their
nutrition and health and wellness center
and they give continued educational
credits by
all sorts of doctors that they pay to do
the seminars so not only do the food and
beverage in coca-cola sponsor these
trainings
uh they actually do them themselves okay
so they don't just pay for the continued
educational building and things but they
actually deliver the seminars on very
selective things that they want them to
to be taught number one they talk about
because you can download the notes
right off that website it's so you know
they're talking about
how these urban legends and it's all
these myths on they are aspartame is bad
or phosphor is bad for your bones so
it's okay to take it everything in
moderation high fructose corn syrup
they're talking about the benefits of
high fructose corn syrup
gmos how there's no problem with gmos
the scientific research
sugar
and
they said there's no link between sugar
and hyperactive kids
yeah i'm not kidding you should just go
right to the list it's incredible the
information that is being pushed out to
the dietitian and then there's no
problem with artificial colorings so in
the in their ingredients so you can see
that
there's a lot of incredible false
information that's being taught to these
dietitians so no wonder
people are not going to get the right
information
so
i think it's the most incredible
marketing tactic by the food companies
to be able to get in there to be able to
train them so that's really why you're
running into a situation with going to a
dietitian trying to actually even lose
weight they're they're kind of
influenced by these other companies
so the bottom line is this
doctors
don't have the training to give the
correct nutritional information because
they're not trained in it and the group
that the doctors send people to the
dietitians are taught by the wrong
source coca-cola
so what's missing in healthcare
is the health part because there's no
training in health by doctors and the
dietitians are being taught by coca-cola
but there's another problem too and
and it has to do with healthcare has
become the management of symptoms okay
the management of symptoms
management of effects
you get a symptom you get it labeled and
then you get it treated
but what about the evaluation what about
the investigation of finding out what's
causing certain things
you have
high sugar okay that's called diabetes
and it's treated but what causes high
sugar and how do we get it corrected
that is never
questioned high blood pressure
hypertension why
what causes it we don't talk about that
we just treat it directly
high cholesterol
why
acid reflux we call acid reflux disorder
right or acid reflux disease no no no
all these are symptoms
they just collapse the two together call
them diseases and then they treat them
to make them sound scientific what's
missing is the evaluation part gerd for
example
gastroesophageal reflux disorder now the
gastrois means a digestive system like
the stomach esophagus comes up through
here reflux disorder so we're talking
about
description of all the different
connecting dots
as it's some type of disease and then
it's treated again these are just
symptoms this is the problem if you
actually treat the symptom you're going
to continue the symptom and you're going
to camouflage the real root problem so
i mean i can see if you have a fever and
they found a microbe like a staph
infection you treat it that's finding
the true cause the staph infection is
the is the cause
of the symptom and is treated by an
antibiotic if you have pain and you get
an x-ray it's fractured and then you get
a cast that's a treatment that makes
sense to me but this other system does
not make sense and i know why because
there's no money in
curing or correcting anything it's it's
become very over specialized we have
special specialists in every single
thing including the retina of your eye
retinologist
you even have doctors of the like a knee
doctor or a foot doctor
or a toe doctor right
so um doctors don't tend to use
sometimes all of the clues or the
symptoms to associate that them together
i'm going to show you just a medical
book called siba
and
here's an interesting thing we take page
84 we take this condition called
it's a hyperadrenal it's too much
adrenal cortisol okay it's called
cushing syndrome
in cushing's syndrome look at this
you have
allergies
you have skin problems you have
inflammation
you have cognitive excessive thinking
all the time
you have high blood pressure
bone loss right here you have all sorts
of
hypertension you have that you have
insomnia sleep apnea low vitamin d
levels
acid reflux right here see if can you
imagine
okay so you wanna you have all these
symptoms and you list them on a page and
you can treat each one of them with a
separate drug
you're never gonna get anywhere because
the real problem the cushing's the
adrenal the hyperactivity is never
corrected but this is what happens is
that everything is separated okay so now
we know that
but why
why
why is this going on here's my two cents
number one i think there's no training
in nutrition number one
i'm sorry 11 hours is not going to cut
it and number two
the doctors are trained by the drug
companies they sponsor the continuing
educational trainings you have the drug
rep that trains the doctors a lot of the
journals that the doctors read are
highly influenced by drug companies who
do the
the research
so it's very very heavy on the drug drug
drug i think the cure of this whole
problem
is this
that i think the doctors
should get way more
training and emphasis
on
health
and nutrition
is that going to happen probably not
because there's no money in it but
here's the situation people are not
happy it's costing the u.s a lot of
money drugs are not making people
healthier
and the problems are not getting fixed
so people are turning to alternative
so that's my two cents on the diagnosing
of healthcare hope you got a couple
things under that and i will see you in
the next video

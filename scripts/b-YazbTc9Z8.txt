you know vitamin D is so important for so many things but it's especially
important for your liver if you have any type of liver problem whether it's a
fatty liver cirrhosis hepatitis you want to be taking vitamin D and I'm going to
talk about why it's so important well deliver is a very large organ and
has 500 different functions it's located on the right upper side right over here
it's about three and a half pounds and it's like the size of a football and the
problems you can develop in the liver it's a fatty liver and inflamed liver
called it hepatitis or fibrotic liver which is a liver filled with scar tissue
we called it cirrhosis typically when people think about liver damage they
think about alcohol but there's something called a non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease and that can come from eating a lot of sugar and refined carbs
over many many years but a vitamin D deficiency can also cause liver disease
but let's go through how a vitamin D deficiency can affect different parts of
your liver the main cells in the liver are called hepatocytes the liver cells
and they are antiviral so they have an antiviral effect while vitamin D
increases this antiviral effect why is that important a big cause of liver
damage is hepatitis that is inflammation of the liver caused by a virus then we
have another cell in the liver called estill itself when you take vitamin D it
increases the still it cell to help decrease your risk of getting fibrosis
fibrosis is part of the scar tissue which eventually leads to cirrhosis then
we have the macrophage there are a lot of macrophages in your liver and this is
an immune cell the liver has a huge immune function and the macrophage
releases certain antimicrobial chemicals or weapons and what is called catalase
sidon vitamin D increases this antimicrobial which is going to reduce
inflammation and before vitamin D stimulates that the cytokines that are
anti-inflammatory there are also pro-inflammatory
cytokines cytokines are communications within the immune system that create
different effects number five and this is a really important one vitamin D
increases the T regulatory cells that specific immune cell is responsible for
putting out the fire calming inflammation down in the body stopping
an immune reaction that is being too enthusiastic and creating too much
inflammation and number six vitamin D can enhance the bile production which
also reduces the fat on your liver as you can see vitamin D does a lot for
your liver so if you have any liver problem I would highly recommend start
taking vitamin D in doses about 10,000 IUs to 20,000 IUs every single day

so I want to talk about oxidative stress and viruses so lately there's been a big
focus on how the COVID-19 virus is killing people and it has to do with
something called oxidative stress and that's basically where you have an
imbalance of too much oxidation and not enough antioxidants now your body
actually makes oxidation or oxidants it also makes antioxidants that's called
endogenous which means that it's coming from within then you have exogenous
oxidation which is coming from the outside like pollution smoking consuming refined
carbs and sugar all increase oxidation now the other thing is that when you get
in viral infection let's just talk about the COVID-19 virus on a blood test
you'll see high amounts of neutrophils and low lymphocytes let me explain what
that means neutrophils are part of the innate immune system and they are a type
of phagocyte that has three ways of killing things it can release chemicals
that kill the pathogen it can eat the pathogen it can also throw a net over
the pathogen and kill it that way as well because there are certain chemicals
that are released a couple chemicals that are released from the neutrophil
are hydrogen peroxide and bleach or the main chemical in Bleach and these two
chemicals are the weapons that the neutrophil uses to kill microbes and
they create a lot of oxidation so we have our own immune system that is
creating this oxidation in response to COVID-19 or some other virus and of
course the virus is creating other immune reactions which is then
contributing to more oxidation then we have the risk factors that are related
to COVID-19 that would be diabetes obesity high blood pressure so with
obesity you have a situation where you have a lot more oxidation and
inflammation diabetes you're getting a lot of oxidation
the high amounts of sugar and the same thing with cardiovascular disease
definitely with the autoimmune conditions all of those not only make
you susceptible to getting the infection but having a lot of complications the
complications of these pre-existing conditions let's say for example
diabetes you'd have peripheral neuropathy of your feet your vision is
affected you have heart problems and especially the lungs the other problem
with having a pre-existing health problem is that when you do your
endogenous antioxidants which means the amount of antioxidants that your body is
making is way way less so we have this imbalance that's created with the virus
itself and then the immune system or reaction which creates more of this on
top of that having a preexisting health problem is just enough to really throw
this thing out of balance to then really have an influence on your mortality so
to have a long healthy life and to minimize the complications of not only
in this condition but the side effects of the viral infection you need to take
these antioxidants and bring them up and bring this right down here some people
that are infected never even notice one symptom at all yet other people really
get hammered really it's the oxidative stress from
these conditions it's creating the damage now the other thing that viruses
will do they will attack the mitochondria which is the energy Factory
so that's called apoptosis where your cells are actually dying but there's
going to be some cells that survive this attack and they're gonna adapt because
the respiratory center is damaged which is the normal machinery to burning fuel
it will adapt to another way of using fuel and that's called fermentation
which doesn't need oxygen and it's an older system that our body doesn't
normally use unless it needs to use it as a survival mechanism so here we have
several cells that have adapted and they're using this
back up machinery or generator to actually use fuel and they metabolize
glucose so this is one way that a virus can trigger cancer what's really wild
about this mechanism is that as soon as a cell switches over to this new type of
machine it will lose its ability to die in other words cancer cells are immortal
and that's what's really really strange about this because the way that the
cancer cell spreads and takes over is that it just continues to grow and grow
and grow where our normal cells they have a certain limit where they will
grow too and then they will die off so yes they become zombies and they just
hog up all the fuel but remember they can only eat glucose but the cancer
cells will also create a tremendous amount of inflammation free radical
damage and oxidation so we have a lot of things going on so what can we do to
switch this back well number one you'd want to start fixing the pre-existing
health problems okay the metabolic syndrome the the diabetes the heart
disease you do that with changing the diet but at the same time we also want
to start eating foods high in these things called antioxidants this will do
two things number one it will put the fire out of this oxidative state in
other words if you're taking antioxidants you'll minimize the
complications of these conditions and minimize the complications of viral
infections that I'm talking about lung inflammation if you are in the hospital
with COVID-19 you should be taking as many oxidants as you can get vitamin A
vitamin C especially vitamin D vitamin E here's another one alpha
lipoic acid then you have trace minerals that act as antioxidants copper zinc
especially zinc selenium is a big one manganese vitamin B1 B2 B6 and B12 are all
considered antioxidants having good microbes also will help increase your
antioxidants so if you get an antibiotic guess what you wipe out the good
bacteria and your antioxidants go down another really good antioxidant is
called NAC this antioxidant is used for tylenol poisoning because tylenol will
destroy the liver if you take this it will reduce the amount of oxidation quercetin
is a really good one especially for people that have allergies that have
a lot of inflammation fasting will increase your network of antioxidants
very very important to know about that exercise will also increase your network
of your endogenous antioxidants and getting enough sleep will also increase
this so we can actually decrease that's right here now if you haven't seen this
video right here this is the next one you need to watch check it out

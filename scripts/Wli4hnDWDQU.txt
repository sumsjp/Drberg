hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video I want to talk about vitamin
companies dirty little secrets okay here's the secret behind these vitamin
companies most of the vitamins sold in America and Europe are made
synthetically ok what does that mean synthetically they're made from
petroleum yeah and other chemicals I'm going to show you this one right here
this vitamin which you could pretty much guess what it is
is the top-selling vitamin in the world they make over 998 million dollars per
year that's just under a billion and the first ingredient is calcium carbonate
now what is that that's limestone that's cement that's what they make cement out
of that's why when you hold this vitamin it feels it's like very odd it's very
heavy ok it's like a paperweight if they have the first ingredient calcium
carbonate chances are the majority of this product is calcium carbonate and it
must be because it's a rock okay here's some other ingredients korvac acid made
synthetically they make it from cornstarch and sulphuric acid well
there's no vitamin C in corn nor there is there any sulphuric acid so again
synthetics corn starch hydrogenated palm oil okay we don't want to put
hydrogenated oils in our body polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol
soybean oil artificial dyes colors yeah well here's the interesting thing if you
wanted to buy calcium carbonate it's basically $95 per ton that's 20 cents a
pound okay that's incredibly cheap so you
could make incredible profits on synthetic vitamins and that's why they
make them because it's very expensive to make food based nutrition okay but not
knowing that you might go for the cheap thing and think you're getting the real
thing but you're really not sometimes a little caffeine in it to make you feel
like it gives you energy but in fact it's all synthetics so basically the
dirty secret is this the one largest vitamin companies in the
world or several of them are making hundreds of millions of dollars selling
cement camouflaged as vitamins okay and then you buy it so the next time you buy
a vitamin read the ingredients make sure it comes from food just read the label
and don't buy synthetics thanks for watching hey guys thank you so much for

today we're gonna talk about fatigue while you're doing keto and when you're
doing in intermittent fasting why would you possibly be tired when you're doing this
it's supposed to give you energy right take a look at what's occurring we're
getting into the state of ketosis so we're trying to burn our fat there's a
lot of energy in our fat cells in other words this fat will turn into ketones
and ketones theoretically have more energy than glucose per gram so that
means there's something wrong in machinery now when we convert from sugar
fuel the fat fuel it normally takes about three days sometimes a little
longer sometimes a little less of what we're trying to do is convert into this
new machinery where our bodies can easily burn fat and then when you get
into four days five days six days two weeks a month now you're really burning
fat the energy should increase unless there's hidden sugars okay if you're
having a cheat meal every other day or having little carbohydrates as snacks or
even protein in between the meal that could keep your blood sugars up and down
and prevent you from getting into the full ketosis so you have full energy so
this is one thing to look at right here next thing I'm going to talk about is
EMF even though it's not necessarily related from your diet it's something
important because I noticed a lot of people sitting from the computer way too
long so they have their computer their screen their cell phone it's giving off
electromagnetic fields when they go to bed at night some of the electrical
wires in the wall could be right at your the head of your bed I will say that
this will really make you tired as well and this is causing fatigue and you keep
changing your diet this won't work you have to find out what's causing the
fatigue so at this point we're going to pretend that this is not a problem and
we're going to focus on your diet but let's say you work all this out and you
still have fatigue take a look at this make some changes there's a lot of
information this I will put some links down below
but reducing the amount of exposure to this can greatly increase your energy
especially in your head okay now the next thing we're going to talk about is
just basically key to fatigue because that's what we're talking about there
could be certain nutrients that you're missing in your diet because when you do
keto and you're burning more fat your body requires certain nutrients more
than others the big one is b5 and b5 is intimately involved in supporting your
adrenal glands and the production of energy and so nutritional yeast would
provide this very nicely kind nutritional yeast that's why I'm going
to recommend because not only will it provide b5 but it'll also provide D
which is b1 okay and a b1 deficiency which is very common especially with
keto and without keto will make you tired and also it makes you nervous
restless leg syndrome is one symptom but definitely it could give you some
fatigue if you don't have enough of this but if you take nutritional yeast
you can kill two birds with one stone okay be having enough potassium and a
sodium okay when you're on keto and in a minute fasting you need a little bit
more sodium and chloride okay salt and I recommend sea salt I'm not going to get
into why but you just need more and if you're deficient in salt that right
there can make you tired now there's a little pump in all of your cells and is
called the sodium potassium pump and you have billions of these little pumps in
every cell and the main job of this pump is to keep the potassium inside the cell
and the sodium outside the cell to form a little battery to power the nervous
system and the muscular system so without enough potassium and sodium the
nerves and the muscles will fatigue and that right there will make you tired and
so when you're on a ketogenic diet and you're not consuming enough of let's
say vegetables you're not going to get enough potassium or let's say you're not
consuming enough salt then this thing also won't work so you need a good
amount of potassium 7 to 10 cups of vegetable and about 1 level teaspoon of
sea salt and that should help that right there should handle your fatigue but
also magnesium could be deficient and that's a real common deficiency with a
lot of people this is intimately involved in making ATP energy currency
of the body so you need magnesium well it just so happens when you're consuming
vegetables you're also getting magnesium so you can kill two birds with one stone
you can also take these as an electrolyte powder and a lot of people
will instantly start feeling more energy simply because their body has been
deficient in these minerals so these are the things to look at
also this if you are tired on keto and intermittent fasting thanks for watching

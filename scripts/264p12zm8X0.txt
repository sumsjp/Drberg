so i'm going through uh the comments on one of my youtube videos and someone
wanted to know what do i do for a heavy period so i
wanted to create a quick video just in that one topic that is an
estrogen dominance situation so if you are taking
birth control pills or are on some type of estrogen
or you're consuming a lot of soy you want to find some alternative because
that's contributing to too much estrogen the first thing i would
recommend too is to avoid dairy because dairy can definitely
increase your estrogen number two cruciferous
vegetables why because these are anti-estrogenic
especially the bad type of estrogen that creates negative effects
but consuming either a concentrated cruciferous
product called dim okay or cruciferous vegetables themselves can
help to balance out the estrogen and i do know it can create a huge benefit
on your menstrual cycle all right number three
calcium d glucarate i don't sell it i don't have any recommendation
you'll have to research yourself but this
product helps to detoxify the liver and in the liver there are certain
things that are constantly balancing out your estrogen getting rid
of the excess estrogen okay there's certain enzymes
well calcium d-glucarate helps those enzymes
work better and it can help lower the estrogen
dominance so this is a really good remedy
for estrogen dominance as well as hot flashes
and number four you can search online or find a doctor that uses standard process
there's a product called ovex works really good for heavy periods
and it supports the ovary itself i would recommend
like during your period take six a day but on the maintenance maybe just
once a day that's my quick video i'll see you in the next one

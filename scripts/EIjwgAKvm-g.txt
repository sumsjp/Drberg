hello dr. Berg here listen I got this question recently I have no more
gallbladder can I eat what I want now right because obviously the problem is
solved so let's talk about that so what happens
you have the liver that makes bile that travels down a tube the bile duct and
it's supposed to go into the gallbladder that it gets stored and concentrated
because you need a majorly concentrated significant amount of bile to be able to
digest a certain meal so right now which just trickles down the bile duct and
very small amount into the small intestine without being concentrated or
stored okay so basically there's 700,000 gallbladder surgeries a year and the
problem is when they take them out they don't really correct the real problem
you see the gallstones are a symptom of something deeper sluggish gallbladder
is not the problem it's a symptom of usually either high estrogen or more
commonly high insulin not necessarily because you're diabetic or it's more of
a pre-diabetes it's called insulin resistance an insulin resistance is a
very common thing here are the symptoms you're not satisfied after you eat you
need a little something sweet you get tired after you eat you get bloated
after you eat you can't go for a long period of time without eating or you get
severe hungry or blood sugar issues you have cravings for sweets you use the
bathroom at night too frequently when you're trying to sleep there's a lot of
symptoms but anyway if this was causing the gallstones it's a gallbladder
problem and you remove the gallbladder the problem is still there okay so you
remove the symptoms kind of taking the the little red indicator light off of
your dashboard and you keep driving eventually you may run into a problem if
you don't change what caused it originally so I put some links down
below if this is your situation you should probably I don't know at least
study up on it to see if you have this and what to do about it
so you don't end up with more problems because if you don't correct it you can
end up with a lot of other issues that are related to insulin now the other
point is that with out enough bile there is a chance that
you could actually have long-term deficiencies of vitamin A so the vision
starts going hard to see at night night blindness things like that
skin psoriasis sinus that's vitamin A lung tissue vitamin D
bone mood you start getting achy muscle and joint pain and even bone pain
calcium issues vitamin E that's heart that's repair wound healing hormones
skin oxygen carrying capacity so when you're deficient in vitamin E you might
find that when you go up flight of stairs you out of breath easily vitamin
K you get bruising unnecessarily bruising you didn't injure yourself but
you started getting bruising like where does that come from and all the
membranes that on your cells are made from these fats so again if you can't
absorb these because there's not enough bile you may also want to get keep take some
bile salts not a lot just a little bit after the meal okay so there's just some
key points if this is your situation so thanks for watching put it to put your

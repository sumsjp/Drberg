hey guys it's dr. Berg here in this video I want to show you what's behind
sleep apnea sleep apnea is not really a sleeping problem it's a sleeping symptom
it's an air obstructive pathway problem people sleep apnea can't breathe because
there's something obstructing the pathways of air getting into the lungs
so if you're not breathing you're not going to sleep so that's why they use
the little CPAP machines to force air in there and then you can sleep better
right there's a couple things that I wanted I want to show you what's behind
the scenes and number one if you have a sleep apnea usually you have a
collapsing of the back part of the sinus back through the throat area and it
starts to what's called atrophy and atrophy is kind of a sagging drooping
tissue that can then obstruct the breathing pathways and it can come from
many different things people say it's obesity but there's a lot of skinny
people that have this and a lot of fat people that don't have it so it's not
necessarily the obesity that does it but you could have some excess fat back
there that's possible but we don't normally accumulate fat in the back of
our sinuses so that's very unlikely but the things that people are doing to
get fat usually are causing other problems in the body and that's the drug
that's the connection number one the immediate thing that I
would do if I were you of you if you have this is change your diet one is
that you want to avoid milk any milk products ice cream and even cheese
because that will create a swelling back here right off the bat and anything that
creates inflammation will be a problem so allergies food allergies are a big
problem sugar is a big problem because sugar will cause swelling of the
different tissues it's very inflammatory and if someone has this problem before I
do anything I will change their diet get them off the sugar
get them off wheat grains that would be breads pastas or crackers biscuits
waffles and milk and then see if it clears up
it might just clear up and they might have allergies
because during seasonal allergies when your sinuses are all clogged up well
that's going to also create a problem with this as well if you have allergies
hives asthma anything like that one of the best remedies would be royal
jelly and that is a kind of a something to get in the beehives where it's a
little excretion of a fluid that the bees put to help grow the queen bee to
help to fertilize that and there's something in there that is really good
to help neutralize allergies so that's one thing I would recommend if you have
a problem with allergies to the sinuses and then send us congestion I would go
after the eating first and then see if that just doesn't just clear it up and
then high cortisol that's high stress that can also shrink a nerve that's
connected to your brain stem when the cranial nerves that goes to the back of
the sinuses and so one of the symptoms of high cortisol or being on prednisone
or cortisone for different conditions that can create a problem with you
developing this condition so if it's that problem I would recommend my
cortisol support product which basically what it does is supports inflammation it
supports adrenal and helps to support the deeper cause of that and that will
help reduce inflammation and then you'll start breathing better if you have
allergies year round that could be a fungus growing in your sinuses because
you had a history of antibiotics but it can also come from other things so if
that's the case then I would work on your gut established friendly flora
build up the good bacteria in your gut and that will definitely help this okay
the last thing I'm going to recommend is apple cider vinegar why because just by
dropping dropping the pH of your body just a little bit with apple cider vinegar
like a teaspoon in some water every day it will instantly increase your oxygen
carrying capacity through your body and you'll actually breathe better and you
should just try it to see if that's that works for you I
there's one more thing I would do as well a lot of times people like at night
have a hard time breathing in general so having plants in the room will increase
your oxygen so in my room I have several plants and I find that if I sleep with a
plant next to me I actually actually breathe better so that's just you know
try to sleep in a greenhouse right you'll just have more oxygen or even in
a thunderstorm you get more oxygen in the air so those are some tips to help
sleep apnea and I will see you in the next video

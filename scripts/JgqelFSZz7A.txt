okay so today we're going to talk about the nine causes of lethargy now what is
lethargy compared to fatigue well it's fatigue with a twist it's fatigued with
decreased activity you're kind of apathetic kind of depressed a little bit you're lacking
motivation you're lacking creativity so that's what lethargy is now there are nine different
causes so let's just kind of run run through the list number one sustain stress where
you're pushing your adrenals and pushing pushing pushing and of course not recovering along the way
let's say that you have three small children right and you're working two jobs and you can't sleep
then you're pushing yourself that's called sustain stress number two over training so
you start working out and you're doing crossfit which is quite intense and you're doing that every
day you're going to feel lethargy because you're not going to give your body a chance to recover
next one lack of sleep well that could come from sustained stress
many weeks of not sleeping you are going to be lethargic number four let's say you're studying
right and you're studying a technical subject and there's a lot of big words
well if you keep pushing through these words without looking them up you are going to be
very tired and lethargic this is why we have dictionaries all right number five excessive
stimulants so you're tired and you're drinking red bull drinking coffee all day
you will start feeling lethargic all right number six hidden infections now this can be either like
epstein-barr virus which you had maybe a long time ago that's being reactivated because you're
under sustained stress stress will reactivate viruses that have been in remission or dormant
also you could have like a little cavitation underneath a tooth a tooth infection and that
can create a lot of us inflammation fatigue even arthritis so any type of hidden infection
even lyme disease that could actually be a situation where you're lethargic all the time
all right number seven emfs electromagnetic fields i've done different videos on this topic i'm going
to do more but this thing right here if you're like on your cell phone all day or you're in for
your computer all day with your headphones you are going to feel lethargic now i'm going to give you
a lot of solutions for that all right number eight old injuries now i'll come back to that in a bit
number nine nutritional deficiencies will definitely cause you to be lethargic so
these are all the potential causes but how do you really find out which one is behind your
lethargy well you need to isolate number one where this lethargy is located is it in your head
is it in your sinuses is it in the back of your neck
is it in your front of your neck is it in your chest like where is this lethargy located
that will give you clues so for example let's say you had mono when you're in high school
which is epstein-barr virus and now it's like years later and you feel a lot of heaviness
and lethargy around your neck okay well some of that virus can get reactivated and so there are
various things that you can do for that situation i put a link down below let's say your lethargy
is in your head okay and you had some head trauma well old injuries especially in the head
can make you lethargic years later now i put a link down below of how to address head
injuries one day i had a patient when i was in practice have this serious lethargy and insomnia
for years and come to find out it all occurred after this car accident where this huge box
you know fell off of a truck in front of her and fell on her head and so i did some work on her
as far as i addressed this injury and i'm going to show you the technique in the link down below
and when i was done doing this technique her whole face changed i said go look in the mirror
she looked in the mirror she looked younger she actually looked like the sense of relief
because old injuries tend to accumulate and apparently that injury still stuck in her skull
and creating problems years later interesting connection but you wouldn't normally connect the
dots unless someone brought it up as a potential problem so let's say for example this lethargy
is like in your chest and maybe it all started after you had pneumonia or some lung infection
again these are just clues to try to pull out what the potential problem is when did
your lethargy start exactly and what did you do just before that that will also give you clues on
what could be causing your lethargy for example let's say you had you changed your diet and you
went on a high carb diet and you created all these nutritional deficiencies well then we know that's
through cause i mean you just want to find out when it started and what might have triggered it
that's going to give you a lot of information and you'd be surprised how many doctors don't
ever ask that one question you can get a huge clue on what could be causing the problem
because there's always something that occurs right before you get a specific symptom
and then what i would recommend is test out one theory at a time and see what it is so for example
if it's if you think it's over training stop exercising for a week and see if your lethargy
goes away let's say there's a hidden infection well you can take oregano oil garlic which can
actually help your immune system and see if you feel better now this also brings up another point
i've had patients come in and tell me they go to the doctor they're given an antibiotic
and they have all these positive benefits like energy and their arthritis goes away
when they're trying to handle some bacterial infection but all these other benefits come up
because they had this other infection going on at the same time that was zapping their energy
so in that case what's the solution do you just keep taking antibiotics no you build up your
immune system you take natural antibodies like oregano and garlic and clove and even thyme all
these things can actually clear out infections not to mention going in on a long fast can do
it as well so you just want to go down the list and start to rule things out emf electromagnetic
fields let's say you stay away from your computer for a couple days and oh my gosh you feel so much
better because you change your environment so anyway these are some tips some things you can do
and also uh some additional possible causes that you may have not have thought about
and additionally some potential causes that maybe you weren't aware of before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by

to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

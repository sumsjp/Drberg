in the transition from going to two meals to one meal a day called omad you may want to try one and
a half meals per day that's o-a-a-h-m i just made this up right now now i have a handful of people
doing this right now and it seems to be really a good transition it's very easy to do because
you're not waiting all day long to actually have that one meal at dinner time you're consuming
the first meal at roughly about one o'clock maybe 12 noon and the second meal at six or maybe five
so that's a five hour eating window so that will give you a 20 hour fast it's pretty easy to do
because you're breaking up this meal and some people that do omad have a very difficult time
consuming all this food enough calories in one sitting so this tends to break it up in a nice
way so you would consume your heavy protein for the first meal maybe some berries and hummus
until you're really satisfied and then five hours later you have your vegetables okay your large
salad you're usually not going to be as hungry maybe you're a little bit hungry if your family
is eating you can eat with them so that's helpful so you have your big salad which is mostly fiber
and out of all the carbohydrates fiber has the least effect on insulin so it's not going to break
you out of ketosis very much and then you can add nuts and seeds on the salad you could maybe add a
little bit of cheese avocado tomato whatever and maybe have a keto bomb as a dessert or maybe some
peanut butter and just so you know fat has the least effect on insulin so we make this meal
lighter mostly foods that don't trigger insulin that much and so this seems to solve quite a
few problems for people number one it's easy to do number two you're breaking up the meals so you can
actually consume more calories and you can get all of your nutrients because you're separating things
out you get the benefit of a 20-hour fast plus you're not stuffing yourself with that second meal
most people are not as hungry if they've consumed a big protein meal in the first part of the day
and so it seems to satisfy your digestion as well and so if you're trying to transition to omad
or you're having a difficult time with omad you may want to try this and then comment down below

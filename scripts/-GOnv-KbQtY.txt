so is konjac noodles okay on keto well another name for konjac noodles would be miracle noodles
or shirataki noodles now this is really popular in asia japan and china but it's made its way over to
the us and uh it's totally keto friendly 97 of it is water it's like this gel that swells up
and three percent is fiber and yes fiber is a carbohydrate
but it doesn't have any effect on insulin because it's non-digestible your microbes will live on it
the type of fiber is called glucomannan and there's some interesting effects of this fiber
it can act as a detox it can help with weight loss there's several studies
and also it can help loosen mucus the thing is when you consume these noodles first of all the
flavor is flavorless there's like no flavor so you have to add some things to it it's not the same
texture as the regular pasta noodle unfortunately but it's similar okay and the other point is that
you may get really thirsty when you consume this because it's going to swell up with water
so you just want to drink some more water it'll hold like 50 times its weight in water
it decreases hunger because it decreases this hormone ghrelin okay that has to do with hunger
it also can help stabilize your blood sugars plus the fiber being digested by the microbes
helps to increase certain small chain fatty acids that help your blood sugars as well it can also
help constipation but most people consume just a small amount so they're not going to notice that
unless you consume like like huge huge amounts again it has no calories because it's a fiber
so you don't have to worry about it affecting your keto plan at all there are two other types
of noodle substitutes that i do like as well spaghetti squash and zucchini noodles so you

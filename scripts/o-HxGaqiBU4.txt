hey i'm back this video is on stinging nettle root it's one of my favorite remedies for arthritis
now personally i have a lot of old injuries and when i had a lot of inflammation
stinging nettle root was probably one of the only things that helped of course in addition to the
vitamin d and the fasting but it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory the nutrition in stinging nettle
root is pretty high as well it has like four times the vitamin c as an orange if you compare the same
volume it's very high in protein non-heme iron magnesium calcium as well as the carotenoids which
is the phytonutrients that help people get rid of inflammation it's also good for your blood sugars
it's also good for the prostate because it'll actually slow down the conversion of testosterone
to something called dht which is a very powerful form of testosterone as well as inhibit excessive
amounts of estrogen in the body so it's great for reducing symptoms of problems with your prostate
it's good for allergies it's good for your blood sugars and there's amazing research
that it can decrease your a1c and help you with your blood sugars but of course if you've been
watching my channel you already know that if you get on keto an intermittent fasting that problem
will be handled pretty quick and as a number five benefit it has the potential to increase lactation
so if a woman is breastfeeding and she needs some help to increase the milk production stinging
nettle root can aid in that function all right guys so that's my short summary of the benefits
of stinging nettle root before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

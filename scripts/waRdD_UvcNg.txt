all right guys today we're going to talk about abdominal pain
i'm doing this video because i actually had several requests uh
actually more than that quite a few people want to know what could be
causing my pain in my abdomen so what i did is i
kind of try to draw an abdomen here with a bunch of other
things so bear with me uh i want to just to make these in
quadrants okay so we have uh this right upper quadrant here okay
so you have the rib cage right here okay then over here we have the
left upper quadrant here's the left lower quadrant
and the right lower quadrant okay so i'm just going to be going through the
different organs and what could be wrong so
first thing is that if you have pain in your left
upper quadrant right here that's going down your left arm
potentially could be the heart not all the time
but it could be a heart attack okay the other thing is that
some people have pain in this area right here like
right above your xiphoid process right here so
as your rib cage come down here right there maybe
even a little bit lower it's called the epigastric area if you wanted to know
but if you have pain or discomfort here that is stomach related so it could be
gerd which is the problem with your valve which basically is a
acid reflux and that's because you don't have enough acid in your stomach
and for all these things i talk about i'm going to put some links down below
you can also have indigestion which is not enough acid
you're not able to digest food especially protein
you potentially could have an ulcer as well in which case you don't want to add
acid you want to add chlorophyll any form of
cabbage seems to work really well on ulcers and gastritis
which is the next thing so gastritis is a situation where your
stomach is inflamed and you don't want to add acid because
that will irritate the lining just realize for you to get an ulcer or
even gastritis you would have to consume a lot of junk
food over a long period of time or it could be alcohol or medication but
it's not a little thing it's a major thing that takes quite a
bit of time to correct a very very healthy eating
i'll put some links down below if you want more data on that
and i already mentioned acid reflux but heartburn for example
would be not enough acid usually and the pain is going to be
usually right here now if you have pain a little bit more to the left side right
here potentially it could be the spleen maybe you have epsine bar virus or you
may have a severe zinc deficiency affects the
spleen any type of spleen problems you want to
take zinc for sure you want to lower your stress
and then we have discomfort underneath the left
rib cage right here which could extend a little lower down here
and that's usually inflammation of the pancreas
the number one cause of pancreatitis or inflammation in the pancreas
is a blocked duct a little tube that comes from the liver
that releases bile sometimes it might form a little
sludge or a stone it will back up and cause a lot of pressure and
inflammation into the pancreas so you can have a lot of pancreatic
inflammation coming from the liver or the bile ducts
themselves in other words the hip bones connected
to the thigh bone everything's connected one of the most common things that
irritates a pancreas and the liver
is vegetable oils okay soy corn canola cottonseed it's in the
mayonnaise it's in the salad dressings an average american consumes
literally 700 calories per day of vegetable oil
that's crazy i don't think maybe you're consuming that much but then someone's
consuming maybe double that's just way too much those vegetable
oils are very very toxic on the body they deplete you have certain nutrients
they're highly inflammatory they're heavy on the omega-6 and there's
no omega-3 at all and of course you know sugar will do it
refined grains if you have a pain underneath your left
ribcage simply evaluate what you've eaten just
before that started and change the diet because there's
something in your diet that you need to remove from the diet and it can also be
way too many cooked foods that are void of enzymes or canned foods will
do it as well and then you start creating a lot of
stress in the pancreas because every time you
eat food especially it doesn't have enzymes
because it's cooked or somehow processed your pancreas has to create enzymes to
digest that food so it's it really has to work hard and of course
the more sugar you do the refined grains the more the pancreas
has to produce insulin so pain underneath the left ribcage is
usually related to that moving our way down here
left lower quadrant if you have pain in this area right here it could be a
kidney stone potentially now if you have a kidney stone that's
dislodged into the tube that comes out of the kidney
the ureters down here you might have pain that goes right down
all the way down a little bit lower right here so it could be in
different places usually kidney stones are rare the more likely cause
is you have some type of inflammation in your your colon your descending
colon or even the small intestine right here colitis for example it could also
be diverticulitis ulcerative colitis
it could be crohn's any type of inflammatory condition
of your colon in which case again i would start to evaluate what you're
eating it could be the most common thing is
gluten because you're eating grains or it could also be grains in general
you could have a big allergy with nuts it could be too
much alcohol it could even be an allergy to dairy but
usually again it's stemming from the diet
find out what you ate that's creating inflammation and
avoid eating that one of the best things to heal
and inflame colon is to fast what is very destructive to the colon is
frequent eating now if the paint's a little bit lower
that potentially could come from an ovarian cyst in which case
i would recommend foods like cruciferous vegetables sea kelp for iodine
that usually will help this problem right here
and then if the pain is on the center lower part
potentially it could be a fibroid if you're female and i'll have a lot of
videos on what to do with fibroids but vitamin d will help shrink fibroids
cruciferous vegetables this is an estrogen problem it could
happen if you're being exposed to too much estrogen or
you're taking birth control pills or estrogen replacement therapy or a lot of
soy or even consuming too much carbohydrate which could then
act as a growth factor and cause an enlargement of certain growths
in your uterus all right so now this quadrant right here okay so
right to your rib cage this whole area right here is usually going to be
a liver problem of course the liver usually is a little
bigger right here but the liver is about the size
of a football it's about three and a half pounds
and there's a tremendous amount of people who have liver problems
and don't even know it because there is no symptoms initially
until later on but usually the pain will be right underneath the rib
cage like a full feeling like even a pain or tenderness
or pain that shoots up into the right shoulder right here
so that's liver it could be a fatty liver and flame liver
it could be a liver that has scar tissue what happens with the liver as
as it fills up with fat the fat dislodges and starts to
accumulate around the organs and you start developing
belly fat okay so belly fat means the liver is
fatty the remedy for that is going on a keto
diet healthy keto and intermittent fasting but there are some things you
can do to speed up the process realize that the liver makes bile okay
it's like a detergent that helps you break down fats
and bile has some very unique things number one
it prevents gallstones number two it prevents like sludge in your bile
ducts it's called cholestasis where you have
this accumulation of cholesterol that is not flowing through these ducts
because you're deficient in bile because the liver is damaged
if that bile gets blocked up okay you will have like a full feeling
right here and then when the bile backs up it can become very toxic
to the cells and create inflammation a really good
remedy to kind of take away the log that's
damming up the flow of bile will be to actually take
purified bile salts if you want more information i put a
link down below but taking purified bio salts
you can take in an empty stomach maybe one in the morning
one in the evening or even after you eat you'll notice that it'll start to help
drain things through these ducts and there's some other really cool benefits
that bile can help you with number one it can decrease inflammation
it can actually reduce fibrosis in the liver it can help break down and
dissolve gallstones not to mention dislodge the blockage
that could be causing the pancreatitis or inflammation the pancreas so it
has a lot of benefits including the regulation of the microbiome
so let's say for example you have sibo small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth in your small intestine so you have all
this bacteria that should be in the large intestine
but it's in the small intestine right here so you get a lot of bloating
guess what purify bile salts can actually
help you get rid of that because it's anti-microbial
it can give someone a lot of relief so not only would i recommend betaine
hydrochloride which is an acidifier for the stomach i
would recommend purify bowel salts to help clean up that basically it's a
really good remedy for a lot of different
digestive issues especially bloating and of course now we get to the
gallbladder so if you have discomfort above the ribcage right here
down here well this is definitely going to be gall bladder right through in here
it's not necessarily always a stone it could be just sludge
and it could be some type of dysfunction in this gallbladder right here why
because there's certain things irritating it vegetable oils will
irritate it sugar will irritate it refined grains
will do it dairy will irritate the colon if you
have an allergy nuts okay nuts will definitely irritate
the gall bladder there's certain things in nuts like
enzyme inhibitors that really can irritate the bile ducts
and cause a lot of problems so if you have
pain right here it could be you're doing way too much peanut butter
or way too many nuts and of course this thing right here alcohol will
really irritate this area right here big time
now moving right down here kidney stone will cause pain right here and sometimes
it's hard to differentiate between a gallstone and kidney stone
because they're very uh close in location a little bit lower on the right
lower quadrant down here is the ileocecal valve that's
the connection between the small intestine and the large intestine
and it could be just blocked so if you actually press down there and massage it
a lot of times it'll pop it open and then the food can get through
fasting is the answer and also just cleaning up some of these things as well
and then we get a little bit lower into the right
there's this thing called the appendix which is kind of a reserve
for certain microbes certain friendly bacteria that will be
released and act to seed the large intestine
after you had antibiotics or diarrhea or something like that
so the appendix has a purpose but if you have pain right there it could be
inflammation of the appendix and of course that's
usually always related to what you're eating and if you're female
and you have pain a little bit lower that could be an ovarian cyst
so seek help with the iodine will help that cruciferous vegetables
and i would avoid dairy right there also realize that the ovary if there's a
cyst could refer pain to the around the back
to the sacroiliac joints right here and an enlarged prostate or inflamed
uterus could shoot pain on the back part right right on your sacrum area and the
kidney stone can refer pain around the back

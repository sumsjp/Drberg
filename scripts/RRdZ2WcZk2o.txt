so i want to talk about the relationship between
the friendly bacteria you have in your gut and around your body as well as the friendly fungus
and so i want to talk about this relationship because people think that your microbiome
all your microbes are just primarily bacteria when you have a lot of different species going
on you have viruses you have different types of funguses like yeast and so they're all supposed
to live together in harmony but anytime you learn a new topic it's very important to define
the words within that topic to really understand the definitions of these basic words so let me
go through a few things and so all the bacteria in your gut the friendly bacteria is called the
microbiome and all the friendly fungus is called the mycobiome one of the challenges with studying
fungus and which by the way it's not very studied because it's very hard to
culture fungus and so the friendly bacteria and the friendly fungus remain friendly until
the environment changes they have the potential to become pathogenic so they can actually morph into
pathogenic strains and create a lot of problems in center bodies now the three new words i'm
going to define and this basically relates to the relationship that you have with these microbes
you have mutualism which you have two organisms two different species that are benefiting from
each other right they're exchanging with each other and so we give our microbes a place to
stay we give them space and they give us immune protection they give us vitamins they give us a
lot of other things so that's called mutualism then you have something called commensalism
okay that's where one species benefits while the other one neither benefits nor is harmful
so that would be maybe someone that lives with you that doesn't necessarily take up too
much space they're not paying for rent they're not doing much to help you but they're also not doing
anything to harm you as well so that's called commensalism then we have another relationship
called parasitism okay this is where you have someone that takes but doesn't give back but also
creates some destruction or harm so for example if you get a parasite in your gut they're gonna
rub all your nutrition they don't protect your immune system they just deplete you of nutrients
and they create other problems and that could be someone that comes to your house and actually rips
you off or steals something they take something but they don't give you anything back and so in
our bodies we have these different relationships with microbes that can either help us do nothing
or harm us just like we have in life right but the main point i want to bring up about this video
because people think that all funguses are bad what are some benefits that the fungus gives us
well it just so happens when you get treated with an antibiotic
you end up getting a fungal infection like candida but when you get treated with an
anti-fungal infections and it kills off all the fungus you end up getting a bacterial infection
so that bacteria becomes pathogenic one bacterial infection would be e coli for example see normally
we're supposed to have a certain amount of key coli that lives in our body that is
not unfriendly until the environment changes and so one big function that the fungus has
is to keep the bacteria in check so you don't actually have these fungus
turning to the dark side becoming pathogenic or overgrowing in large amounts same thing with
viruses you have viruses in your gut that actually keep the bacteria in check and also the bacteria
keep the fungus in check so they all work together and so the really important thing we need to learn
from this is that anytime you use an antibiotic or an antifungal or anything that destroys the
microorganisms living in our body it comes with a package you start getting unfriendly bacteria
unfriendly fungus unfriendly parasites and so it's very very important to recognize the function
of these microbes and take care of them now if you have a candida infection or you have a
fungus growing in your toenails or whatever there's various things that you can do
instead of taking an anti-fungal which has side effects there's things that you
can take that have no side effects but they can definitely help control the pathogenic
fungus as well as the pathogenic bacteria and the number one thing that will do that would be
oregano oil now you can take that as a supplement or you can actually even take the oil and put into
it like a neti pot and infuse it into the sinuses if there's a fungus infection in your sinuses
another really interesting natural anti-fungal would be gemnema which normally is a plant
that helps diabetes in fact if you ever take gemnema as a herb and you chew on it it'll
actually block the taste of sweet so if you're consuming anything with sugar you won't be able
to taste that sugar so i've done videos on that before so oregano oil is really really powerful
gemnema is a really good one as well as taking a friendly fungus and there's two that i recommend
saccharomyces cervicia is one of them and the other one is saccharomyces bilardi both of these
are friendly yeast and they're even added to certain probiotics and i put a link down below
if you want more information about that anyway i think this is an important topic the relationship
between bacteria and fungus and the importance of keeping them in check so they don't turn on you
and become pathogenic hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here
avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system
i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

we're going to talk about the most powerful agent to increase hdl and by the way there's
no medication that has been found to increase hdl and at the same time improve your health but
this natural remedy i'm going to talk about will naturally increase the hdl and improve your health
all right what is hcl hdl stands for high density lipoprotein it's a type of lipoprotein what's a
lipoprotein that is a protein that carries lipids or fats throughout the body and hgl is the one
that is considered the good cholesterol because it transports fat or removes fat from the cells
now where does this fat go well it's carried back to the liver and it's also transported to
the adrenals the ovaries and the testicles to make certain hormones steroid hormones if needed or the
excess fat that's carried by the hdl to the liver is either turned into bile or carried by the bile
out of the liver into the small intestine where it gets eliminated throughout the body
now if you're deficient in bile and you have all this cholesterol that's when you're going to be at
risk for getting gallstones because gallstone is too much cholesterol concentration versus
the bile salts so you need this correct ratio to work and i've done a lot of videos
on biosalts you can learn about that through other videos but the point is that this hdl
takes the cholesterol the excess of cholesterol from the cells brings it to certain organs in
the liver and then gets rid of it through the bile routes now hdl also acts as an antioxidant
because it inhibits oxidation which is very interesting hdl also can decrease inflammation
and it can decrease clotting in your arteries all right so now the question is what is the
most powerful agent to increase hdl that is niacin that's vitamin b3 it has been proven to
significantly reduce atherosclerosis progression as well as decreasing the risk from cardiovascular
events now the key with niacin is it must be the type of niacin that creates the flush
if you get the no flesh version it won't create this effect number two going on a low carb
moderate protein high fat diet that's called a ketogenic diet it just so happens that going on
the ketogenic diet creates a similar effect to niacin in increasing hdl very interesting number
three regular exercise will increase hdl number four fatty fish or foods that are high in omega-3
like cod oil for example magnesium can increase hdl fasting and intermittent fasting will increase
hdl if you stop smoking your hdl will go up if you avoid trans fats your hdl will go up if you
consume fiber from vegetables your hdl can go up mct oil can increase hdl coconut oil will do it
avocados will do it cold press extra virgin olive oil will increase hdl and so will pistachios all
right there you have it the summarized data on hdl hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

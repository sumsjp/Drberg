if you have a brain you definitely need to fast let's talk about why your brain
loves ketones and when you don't eat your body is actually eating your own fat and it's converting
into ketones and it's feeding your brain if your brain has a choice between glucose in the blood
or ketones in the blood which is a byproduct of fat it will always go after the ketones over
glucose there's a there's a lot of magical things that happen to your brain when you start fasting
especially when you do periodic for long fasting you get neurogenesis now what is
that that is the regrowing of neurons and that's wild you also get a spike in this protein bdnf
brain derived neurotrophic factor and that protein stimulates the regeneration of cells
in your hippocampus that's the area where you have like a relay between your your database like your
memory database and also it's involved in learning and many other things also the regeneration of the
cortex of the brain and the forebrain i mean only certain parts of your brain can be regenerated and
thank goodness we can regenerate these parts right here so you have improved learning improved memory
and alertness you also have another interesting thing you get a spike in plasticity what the heck
is plasticity that has to do with your neurons connecting adapting and being more flexible and
less rigid which is actually a good thing the other thing that happens is that your brain
cells start resisting stress it's called neural protection so if there's some type of insult
whether it's a chemical like chemotherapy or whatever your cells just start surviving better
you also get something called neuronal autophagy autophagy is the recycling of
damaged proteins but when you're fasting the body is clearing out these damaged proteins
out of the neurons in the brains it gets rid of damaged mitochondria in the brain so it actually
makes your brain younger which is very very cool and it helps your existing neurons survive
better now in our bodies we have friendly bacteria we have unfriendly bacteria there's a friendly
e coli that we have that does not create any problem for us and that e coli helps to
combat the unfriendly uh strain and what's interesting is when you stop feeding these
microbes they actually can live four times longer than if you feed them go figure also yeast survive
twice as long when you put them on a fast and so fasting is very beneficial for your brain
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need to debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call

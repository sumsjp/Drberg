so i had a question recently can you actually reverse
diabetes and the answer is it depends on if you understand diabetes
okay because realize and we're mainly talking about type 2
diabetes okay now type 1 is an autoimmune
and i'm not going to make any claims that that can be reversed but i'm not
going to say that it can't be reversed with the right treatment but in
this video we're talking about type two the actual mechanism
or the pathology of diabetes type two has to do with something called
epigenetics okay so if you understand this
then you can reverse diabetes type two the term epigenetics means above
genetics so even if you have a genetic weakness that your family
is passed on to you that can increase the risk of you getting diabetes
epigenetics is about lifestyle and there's certain things that you can do
with your lifestyle and your diet and your stress level and exercise and
things like that that you can control and keep these
genes from expressing certain diseases
so is it reversible well if you attack this problem at this level
can you reverse it with medicine i don't think you can
you can just manage it and this is why the main focus
of diabetes is the management of your blood sugars
as well as minimizing the complications from diabetes so they're going to give
you medication and other advices to manage your blood
sugars as well as give you other medications if
there's other complications that occur whether it's high cholesterol high blood
pressure etc my thought is this if you were to attack
it at this level and really understand that diabetes is a
blood sugar problem you have high blood sugars
right and instead of trying to lower the blood sugars
just lower what's causing the blood sugar to rise in the first place which
is carbohydrates it's mind-boggling to me
even when you look this up on a medical website
or even you talk to the medical profession or
you look under wikipedia and you find there's very minimal emphasis
on the key thing that the person needs to do
to really put this diabetes into a state of remission
so obviously if you lower the carbs you're going to lower insulin
you're also going to lower something called insulin resistance if you're new
to my channel you need to watch the links
below when we're done here because these are
all the things that raise insulin that then
cause you to have insulin resistance that then cause you to
become a pre-diabetic and then an actual diabetic
etc etc so we want to reverse this by eliminating any and all
reasons why you have high blood sugar in the first place
so obviously you want to eliminate sugar refined sugar now it's interesting if
you take sugar cane with all its vitamins in
there and you consume that so you're having
the same carbohydrate with the nutrients you're going to have
minimal side effects from diabetes so even though you might
get diabetes you have very minimal side effects
because it's the vitamins and nutrients and trace minerals
and phytonutrients that mitigate or inhibit the complications
of chronic disease they lessen the symptoms so that's interesting
i'm not telling you to do that but you just should know that
high carb diets especially when they're refined in nature
will lead to this problem right here high fructose corn syrup is is probably
the number one i should have put it right here
it's very very void of any nutrients and it's just it's just terrible
vegetable oils soy corn canola cottonseed oil they're omega-6
they create inflammation they lead to insulin resistance
this is huge right here starches the potato chips the french fries
the rice the white rice all will create blood sugar problems certain
medications like statin drugs
beta blockers anti-anxiety anti-depressive drugs can actually
increase insulin to certain diuretics and the big one is the glucocorticoids
the steroids that are involved in all sorts of conditions that you're
trying to drop inflammation in fact i know of a gentleman that
developed his diabetes after he took steroids from other some
other condition so that's a big one and then chronic
stress can also lead to a blood sugar problem
and eventually diabetes this is a long answer
to a short question yes you can reverse it if you never want to understand it
and number two if you attack the epigenetics
as a primary cause
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

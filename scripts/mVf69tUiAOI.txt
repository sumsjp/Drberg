so the question is why is a tomato so empty and flavorless well this also explains why it's very
difficult to get your kids to eat their vegetables because they don't taste like anything so is it
the lack of nutrients that's causing this problem well nutrients themselves don't have any flavor
so what is it well a tomato and other plants have hundreds of flavor chemicals and that's what
gives you the flavor and it just so happens that these flavor chemicals are made from essential
nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids like essential amino acids and so we do have a direct connection
between nutrients and flavor chemicals now why does the food have flavor in the first place
well it has to do with survival a survival mechanism it's like the plant saying hey
i'm over here come get me this is where all the nutrients are and so when you talk about real food
flavor equals nutrients it's a survival mechanism it's our way of detecting
if something has nutrients in it or not and within our body we have this great desire for flavors so
we can be attracted to nutrients now unfortunately since the 50s the nutrients and foods have just
took a dive downward and so nowadays when you get this amazing looking tomato at the
store and you bite into it it's like okay where is the nutrients where is the flavor
and so there's so many foods nowadays that are bland chicken breasts beef commercial beef
uh commercial pork just really bland did you know that they actually now flavor meats as well
in fact the next time you buy some meat at the store look on the label you're gonna find out
they actually had flavorings to meat chicken breast has chicken flavor to make it taste like
chicken yeah i'm not kidding and so people made this transition away from real food because it's
so bland to processed food and that's where they add all the flavors this data is from an
amazing book that i'm reading it's called a dorito effect fascinating information i highly recommend
that you get it i'll put a link down below and the thing about doritos is i was the guy that consumed
massive amounts of doritos in college in high school because of these amazing flavors and of
course i couldn't stop eating them because there is no signal back to my brain letting me know
that there's nutrients in there so i kept eating them over and over and over so we've made this
shift in the last 40 years from nutrient-dense foods to flavorful processed foods and this is
one of the big reasons why people are overeating because they don't have the nutrients so what is
the solution try to get your foods from places like the farmer's market or get foods that are
like grass-fed while caught organic you are going to get more nutrients and definitely more flavor

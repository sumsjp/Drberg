let's talk about birth control and copper overload
when you're on birth control pills or an iud which usually comes with copper
and that can create a lot of problems because when you increase
copper you severely decrease zinc and you create an imbalance
there's a lot of symptoms that can occur from too much copper but here's the
thing estrogen increases copper in your body
and one of the reasons why they use copper
as an iud is it immobilizes sperm it's
antimicrobial and it creates a lot of other things too
that can inhibit fertility one is it increases estrogen
so copper increases estrogen and estrogen
increases copper they feed each other but at the same time we're lowering zinc
lowering vitamin c lowering iron it impacts the
vaginal microbiome the bacteria that regulates
estrogen so we get this huge alteration in estrogen
not to mention that high levels of copper
stop the liver from removing excess amounts of estrogen so we have
this increase in copper increase in estrogen
and the symptoms that occur with copper toxicity
hyperactivity adhd autism skin sensitivity so the sensation
of even clothing on your skin gets very very irritating to you
can inhibit your ability to learn because of how copper affects certain
parts of the brain the little white spots on the nails
you becoming more emotional especially angry or irritable
potential problem with ringing of the ears and sensitivity to
shellfish well what can you do well there's several things you can do one is
to find a safer birth control method number two
you can get a product called dim which is a concentrated
cruciferous compound cruciferous is very anti-estrogen so it will help to
regulate estrogen in a very natural way without
any side effects also to reestablish the microbiome you
not only want to take something with probiotics you want to
take a prebiotic so you want to take some fiber from vegetables things like
that i recommend doing a like a fermented sauerkraut or
kimchi or even fermented pickles that will give you both the prebiotics
and the probiotics together and that will help you because another
side effect from birth control pills is high levels of candida as well
so you can actually help that condition number two
calcium d-glucorate this is a really good remedy to help
balance your estrogen and even more importantly
is to make sure you take them with zinc just by taking enough zinc will
automatically lower your copper and pull you out of this copper overload
pretty quickly simply because zinc and copper work
together all right thanks for watching before you

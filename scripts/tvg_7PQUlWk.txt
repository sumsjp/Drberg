i wanted to address the question does mct oil lead to higher levels of cholesterol and the
answer is a big fat no it won't in fact there are some studies that show that it will lower
your cholesterol why because it can increase your bile increases the bile flow in order to increase
bile you need certain fats so bile is essential in dealing with excess cholesterol it helps to
break it down and actually push it through into the intestines and out through the body
virgin cod liver oil is 55 % mct oils and there's some data that shows that it too
can potentially lower your cholesterol now other studies will show that mct oil and coconut oil
won't increase it or decrease it it has no effect so you know really depends on the other
variables but what happens to the mct oil once you consume it is it breaks down quick it goes
right to the liver and it turns in the ketones to give you energy i always recommend mct oil in the
transition phase as you get into ketosis to help you fast longer so some people put in their coffee
it's very satisfying so your hunger will go down it also will help give you more energy
specifically more brain energy and less brain fog if given the choice between glucose
and ketones the brain will go after the ketone and so when you take mct oil you're going to feel like
your cognitive function is better you have more endurance and you'll need less naps
and if you're exercising mct oil can help you go longer because you'll have more energy

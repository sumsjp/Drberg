so the question is why do people with a fatty liver eventually get
arthritis what is the connection there well there's different stages of liver damage
you have a fatty liver then you have a fatty liver with inflammation then you get
scar tissue in the liver eventually turning into cirrhosis which is an advanced form of
fibrotic tissue in the liver so arthritis is inflammation of the joint so how does
that inflammation get from the liver into the joint through different mechanisms number one
the fat in the liver is both adipose tissue as well as ectopic fat which is fat outside the
adipose tissue so ectopic fat is sort of like a spill over fat that can't fit into the fat cell
so it starts to go invade different organs and tissues now adipose tissue is an endocrine gland
that actually makes cytokines these are proteins that cause inflammation ectopic fat
also increases cytokines and the specific type of cytokines that are produced cause systemic
inflammation inflammation all over your body like in your joints it can also trigger rheumatoid
arthritis as well and then on top of that to make things worse cytokines that can then worsen
or create insulin resistance and more insulin resistance increases more systemic inflammation
so you can see that it's a chain reaction that keeps feeding itself now if you're going to have
all this inflammation in the body you're going to heal with scar tissue it's called fibrosis
eventually leading to cirrhosis and if there's cirrhosis in the liver you're not going to be
able to produce bile effectively anymore so a lot of the bile is going to get trapped in the
liver and anytime you have this powerful detergent that can't flow to the liver that alone is going
to create more inflammation of the liver on top of the already existing inflammation and because
bile is not created in sufficient quantities you're not going to be able to absorb from your
food or your supplements omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory so that alone can increase
inflammation not to mention the lack of absorption of the other fat cyber vitamins like
vitamin e vitamin a and vitamin d all very heavy in influencing inflammation dropping inflammation
so if you're not able to absorb those fat cyber vitamins unfortunately you're going to be in a lot
of pain and stiffness throughout the entire body so what is the moral of the story you want to save
the liver protect your liver if you're new to my channel i created a link down below of exactly
what you should be eating to do that before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you

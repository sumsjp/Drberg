so i had someone i talked to recently on the phone um she said that keto didn't cure
my diabetes okay so she wanted to talk to me and because in one of the videos i said that it would
you know fixed her blood sugars it would help stabilize a1c and she would be cured well i don't
remember ever using work here but i will say that keto does help balancing sugars and normalize your
a1c so i wanted to find out what she was talking about so i started asking her questions and this
is what she said she said i did the program for six weeks i normalized my blood sugars i even was
able to get off my medication but as soon as i went back to my normal diet my regular diet
it came back i thought keto was supposed to cure my diabetes okay
so let me explain what i said to her and where the real problem is it's basically faulty
logic her normal irregular diet is really not the normal regular diet take a look at this keto
keto actually has five percent of all the calories should be carbs her diet which is the standard
american diet is 65 carbs okay so the food pyramid right now recommends between 45 and 65
of all your calories should be carbohydrates okay look at the difference from 5
to 65 that is not normal okay if we go from 23 grams of carbs per day
to 300 grams of carbs per day this is 13 times more carbs than should be consumed in your body
if you take a look at someone's blood sugars okay normal blood sugar should be about 80.
what does this mean 80 this means that you should have about no more than one teaspoon
of sugar in all of your blood it's like a gallon and a half of blood okay that's just a tiny bit
that is such a small amount our bodies were not designed to have this much carbohydrate
they were designed to have this much carbohydrate and this percentage right here this is really
normal this should be your regular diet when you do this you actually create diabetes so i told
her we're not trying to cure disease with certain treatment all we're trying to do is bring you back
to your real normal diet which is right here this should be the diet you should be on naturally
and that way you can avoid a lot of problems down the road but the big confusion that this lady had
was that she assumed this was normal simply because everyone else was doing it it's being
promoted as the food pyramid that everyone should be on that is the
false information right there so it's just a normal way of eating to maintain your health
and minimize all the other complications that come with this diet right here which is very abnormal

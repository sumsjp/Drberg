hey guys it's dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you how to
prevent a fatty liver when you try to lose weight on your diet okay I'm going
to use this little book to show you a reference a textbook on medical
physiology this is the Bible of medical physiology this is very interesting I
found this quote here and let me read this to you effective insulin Lac on
causing a fatty liver strange as it may seem though insulin Lac causes
disillusion which is the breaking down of something of the fat stores in
adipose tissue it causes a great increase in the amount of stored
triglycerides in the liver leading to a very fatty liver Wow what does that mean
that means that when you lower your insulin and you start burning a lot of
fat you're at risk of making your liver fatty because all that fat has to go
through the body but there's two things that I want to talk about so what
happens you go on an eating plan and you're lowering insulin okay if you
watch some my other videos on insulin we want to lower that thing down way down
there so that's avoiding this sugars we want to avoid eating so many meals and
grazing and snacking and all that so cause this fat cell to dissolve and then
the fat goes to your blood and ends up in the liver okay there's two things
you're going to do to prevent this from happening number one you have to there's
no way around it you have to keep the vegetables in your diet high and that's
why I always recommend at least minimally every single day 7 cups of
vegetables because even the Atkins diet they don't emphasize it's all this high
protein but then they don't emphasize the vegetable and some other diets don't
even recommend vegetables they keep it low like ideal protein well what's going
to happen you're going to end up with the final liver because we need the
vegetable to clean that liver to pose all the fats that that's coming out of
out of you so we want vegetable we don't want corn we want leafy greens
okay not just from a powder but actual salads and
so you're going to have to figure that out now you can drink your salad and
account shake if you want but we need the vegetable okay so that's number one
number two apple cider vinegar what's an apple cider vinegar apple
cider vinegar is really really really good for the liver and the help dissolve
a fatty liver and clean it up there are other supplements that you can take like
choline for example that also are good for a fatty liver and that's the type of
B vitamin and believe it or not guess what food has the highest choline egg
yolks interesting right lecithin is another thing you consume to dissolve
the fatty liver and guess what I have as high lecithin egg yolks so egg yolk is
actually a really good thing to consume and because what'll happen if you do
that your body will then make less cholesterol because there's cholesterol
in the egg yolk so your liver makes about 2,000 milligrams a day so if you
eat a little bit more egg your body just makes less so egg yolks are totally okay
so we want vegetable we want egg yolks and we definitely want apple cider
vinegar 2 tablespoons and a glass of water three times a day ok so that's
just an important tip as you do your program to prevent if I liver and also
how do you know if you have a fatty liver well if your belly is big you have
a fatty liver okay but if you want to prevent a fatty liver go ahead and keep
the vegetables in it all the time all right see the next video

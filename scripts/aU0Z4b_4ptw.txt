now are you in a low-carb diet but you're still hungry or craving or still have an appetite
there's seven reasons why this is uh one of the reasons could be you're just in a habit
of eating certain things or some social event and that's so you're not really hungry you're
just in the habit of it but if you actually are truly hungry let's go through the list
number one you're not doing fasting with your low carb diet if you're eating too frequently
you're going to trigger insulin every time you eat and that alone is going to make you hungry
i find the majority of the population that starts keto without fasting does not see near the results
so include intermittent fasting number two there's hidden carbs you might be doing low carb
but if you really look at those carbs maybe you're doing some yogurt which actually has quite a bit
of carbs or you might be consuming some keto friendly uh packaged foods or cookies or whatever
and there's carbs in there despite it saying it's keto friendly number three your dietary fat is too
low i think this one right here is really going to help you if you just start increasing the fat
keto is not low fat you want to increase the fat to satisfy you and also so you can fast
longer number four you're just not giving enough time so you just did this for a week
well you could have insulin resistance and that could take weeks before it really kicks in you
should start noticing some changes within even three days but if you don't give it a little bit
more time make sure you're doing it correctly and it will work number five your nutrients in
your foods are too low you're doing low carb but the quality is not there you're not doing enough
uh and i always recommend like a huge salad or vegetables a day that'll give you some nutrients
because if you're not and you're not taking supplements you could be hungry just from that
because the nutrients signal the hypothalamus in your brain to turn off that hunger number six
insulin resistance have more insulin and also your cells will not allow you to absorb nutrients
especially like vitamin d vitamin c potassium magnesium so you're not getting those nutrients
in to satisfy the brain so realize if you're doing low carb by the book and fasting and you're still
hungry this could be the thing which means you need to give it more time and there's a lot of
other things you can do i'll put a link down below you could have a fatty liver or your gallbladder
being removed or some problem with either the gallbladder or the liver and have not enough bile
and that means you're not extracting the fat soluble nutrients that are very satisfying to your
brain or you're not getting the complete digestion of other things like there are even fat soluble
phytonutrients in in plants that are very very beneficial so if you have enough bile you're going
to be more satisfied now it's interesting when i was researching this topic i found this study
that stated that a high carb diet low fat is more satisfying than a low-carb high-fat diet
and i'm like wait a second let me just see what foods they're recommending and so i listed them
right here here we have a high carb low fat diet compared to a low carb high fat diet
okay so this would be more keto and this would be like a standard diet right well i i noticed
that the foods that they were testing skim milk against whole milk both of them were doing cereal
both were doing white bread but in this group here they were doing a thicker
white piece of white bread over here they're doing a medium piece of white bread over here
it's egg over here it's egg with margarine really over here we have low-fat margarine
versus butter and then we have sugar in both and then over here we have low-fat pizza
versus high-fat pizza what is the problem there's too many carbs in both of these
diets to be able to do a correct study because in truth this low carb study is not low carb and so
this is what really gets me this is why i drink on the weekends no i'm just kidding i don't but when
you start putting out information in the news that is completely false based on incorrect information
like this and sometimes people are going to believe that and then end up doing the wrong
thing all right there you go the seven reasons why you are still hungry on a low carb diet

let's talk about the seven sneaky viral strategies now these viruses are very
very devious and a virus is much smaller than a bacteria now are they alive
not really are they dead not really it's one of those things where you have this
this little sack with this tiny little copy machine in here it's like a
genetic copy machine that has the ability to copy itself over and over and
over but it could only do that if it invades your cells into the nucleus of
the cell and then leech onto it and suck the life out of your cell and then
replicate that way certain cells that don't have the DNA they can't really do
anything like your red blood cells for example so that's what they do and they
start reproducing and create a lot of damage within your immune system because
your immune system sees this foreign invader now and it creates inflammation
and it starts to create collateral damage alright so number one viruses can
infect your own immune cells the B and T cells the monocytes and even your thymus
and viral specific t-cells the thymus is right above the heart and it's a gland
that help it's like the training camp for your white blood cells so it trains
your white blood cells to defend against pathogens so these little guys can
invade the thymus and other immune cells now what happens now is that virus kind
of becomes part of your cell and it's viewed as your own cell by your own
immune system so that's one sneaky way it goes underneath the radar and it
doesn't get detected all right number four viruses have the ability to escape
antibody response so think about this a virus the shell of a virus has a little
protein on it and it's like a little flag that your immune system can see and
tag and go after right well these little special proteins or little flags can be
hidden by the virus so our own immune system cannot find them and so you have
this delayed immune response until after the infection has set in very very
sneaky all right here's another scenario number five you can have two viruses
invade one cell and then what they do is they work together to rearrange those
proteins on the outside of the cell so they can escaped attack from our own
immune system all right number six escaping what's called cytokines which
are signaling molecules for the immune system they're involved in inflammatory
responses and viruses can sometimes escape these little guys right here so
there's no inflammation there's nothing for your immune system to indicate that
it is a virus there all right number seven certain viruses can downgrade vitamin D
receptors what does that mean it means that it blocks your ability to
absorb vitamin D and vitamin D is intimately involved in controlling your
immune system so without vitamin D you're going to be more susceptible to
viruses and you don't have that protection anymore so viruses have one
strategy of suppressing the immune system by blocking vitamin D this is why
you see so many diseases involved with the associated low vitamin D condition
well that's probably because there's a virus involved in that disease and if
you haven't seen my video on how to bulletproof your immune system

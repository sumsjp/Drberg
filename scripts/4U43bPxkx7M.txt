so is it possible when you start the keto plan or you start intermittent fasting that
you're going to start spiking your adrenal hormones and create more stress in the body
the answer is no some people have the viewpoint that yeah it appears to be stressful because
you're starving the body you're starving the body of glucose i mean what about the fat on
our body an average thin person is walking around with about a hundred thousand calories of fat on
their body and it's there to be used as a backup for fuel we only actually have 1700 calories
of stored glucose so it's very logical that our bodies were designed to run off fat between meals
and so when your body starts adapting from glucose to fat which takes about three days it's not a
pathological problem it's a normal response to just shifting your body from glucose to fat fuel
now the stress hormone called cortisol has another name it's called glucocorticoid and you can see
that glucose is part of that name because one of the big functions of cortisol or a glucocorticoid
is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low but when your body is fully adapted
to fat fuel and so what a glucocorticoid will do it will release store glucose or even cause
the production of glucose from protein or ketones just to maintain your blood sugars but that's not
a stress event it's a normal thing that occurs in your body now there's a little bit of this
raise in that hormone when you go through this three-day adaptation when you start ketosis
but then it levels off now let's just compare what happens when you run your body in glucose
you are activating the sympathetic nervous system constantly it's very stressful for the body it's
difficult for the body to go from one meal to the next you're constantly relying on
food because you're not able to tap into your own fat and so you have this up and down up and
down roller coaster ride but when you get into full adaptation and get into ketosis
you can go from anxiety or a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of
well-being so burning fat being on ketosis is a non-stressful state and once a person has adapted
there is no study out there that shows that you're going to have high levels of cortisol
now one last point i want to bring up is when you do keto where you're going on fasting make
sure that you take electrolytes and b vitamins because the requirement goes up for both of those
categories of nutrients hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what
about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

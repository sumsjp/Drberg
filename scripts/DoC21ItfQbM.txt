had someone recently comment on my youtube channel um they wanted to know why am i getting pcos i'm
not even 18 years old so i wanted to create this quick video on pcos just to explain the simplicity
of it so you really understand it polycystic ovarian syndrome poly means many and then we have
the word cyst okay many cysts but in reality it's not true it's not really cyst it's follicles but
i'm not going to get into that but for right now just understand that there's these little bumps
growing and there's many of them on the ovary okay so we have polycystic ovarian and then syndrome
now a syndrome is not necessarily a disease it's suggestive of a disease but it's a disorder having
more than one symptom that suggests a disease okay so
all right what are the symptoms infrequent or prolonged menstrual cycle excess male hormones
as in androgens infertility excessive hair growth throughout your body thinning of the
hair on your head acne and insulin resistance now if you look up this condition on wikipedia
it will give you a lot of general information that that is not very helpful uh they'll talk
about the cause being genetic they'll talk about the cause being potentially environmental
also they will tell you that pcos has no cure but it can be treated with metformin anytime you're
trying to figure out some mysterious medical condition um realize that there's usually one key
factor that you need to know to figure it out there's one piece of information that explains
everything and that is rarely if ever found in wikipedia or the first page or second page or
third page on google when you do searches and so one thing that i'm really interested in is
doing videos on that key piece of information so you can figure everything out with pcos the key
piece of information is this high androgens can be caused by high levels of insulin okay
that's what you need to know in other words every single one of these symptoms right here is coming
from high androgens because you have high levels of insulin now what's interesting is that they
rarely ever check insulin levels they'll check your blood sugar levels now you cannot determine
what's happening with insulin by checking your blood sugars because you could have normal blood
sugars yet have high levels of insulin because the insulin resistance will buffer some of that
blood sugar response until a certain point where it can't buffer it and then it can't compensate
and you become a pre-diabetic and a diabetic but for right now all you need to know is that your
high androgens are coming from the high levels of insulin that's why they treated with metformin
because metformin treats insulin resistance which will help regulate your insulin levels and help
normalize them okay but what's behind high levels of insulin well if you're new to my channel i
every almost every single video i have is related to that one topic you need to do healthy keto and
intermittent fasting is your primary eating plan to help you regulate your insulin levels and then
get your pcos reevaluated because you are probably going to find that you have a lot less problems
with this disorder why because you're getting to the root cause if you're new to my channel and you
want to know what to do i put a link down right below of exactly what you should be eating hey

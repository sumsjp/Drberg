you know your sleeping problem could be happening because your pulse rate is just too
high so in this video i'm going to talk about all the reasons why your pulse rate could be too high
number one it could be a vitamin b1 deficiency which a lot of times comes from a high carb diet
there's many other causes and i've done many videos on b1 but if you're deficient in b1
you could have a higher pulse rate all right number two at potassium deficiency potassium is
a physiological tranquilizer it calms the nervous system down if you're deficient in potassium your
pulse rate will tend to be on the high side and also your blood pressure will also be on the high
side and so what can create a potassium deficiency well it could be you're just not consuming enough
potassium so you need to consume more salads because if you start having bigger salads like
at least seven cups a day you're going to get more potassium and magnesium which is another mineral
to help calm things down also a high carb diet will cause a potassium deficiency too much acid so
if you're too acidic that can cause tachycardia or it can raise your pulse rate i remember consuming
um a whole bottle of kombucha tea right before bed and my pulse rate was like so that's one
thing to look for number four stress if you're stressed out that can raise cortisol or adrenaline
i have a lot of videos on that so i'll put that link down below but cortisol and adrenaline can
keep your pulse rate too high i mean try to sleep if you're in a stress situation or you're being
chased by a tiger next one is over training if you exercise too much that can keep your pulse rate up
and that really has a lot to do with number seven which is an autonomic nervous system dysfunction
if you're deficient in your parasympathetic nervous system the recovery system
and you're kind of sympathetic dominant and you exercise too much that's not a good combination so
what you need to be doing is long walks and you need to restore the autonomic nervous system
by more vitamin b1 that will help but over training is a thing that can definitely keep
your pulse rate higher i remember in practice one time i had this lady come in and i i told her to
exercise in my clinic because we had a little gym and her pulse rate went up to 158 she comes back
the next day paul strait was still at 158 and i tested her and she had no parasympathetic nervous
system which is the recovery system it actively pushes your pulse right down so that was a good
lesson for me that you really want to check the person's recovery system before you have them
exercise especially if it's a higher pulse rate type exercise number six a hot flash will increase
your pulse rate number eight certain medications will increase your pulse rates anemia is another
thing that can increase your pulse rate next one is a hyperthyroid situation and by the way
if you have hyperthyroidism and you take b1 that can help with that condition 11. either you have
high blood sugars or a low blood sugar situation that can increase your pulse rate i have a lot of
videos on both of those conditions and 12 and i should have put this higher up on this list
but a gallbladder problem if you start the ketogenic diet and you have a gallbladder problem
and you add all this fat to the diet and you don't have enough bile salts because of various
situations it could overload the gallbladder and create more sludge within the gallbladder system
and i'm not even talking about a gallstone i'm just talking about a backup into the bile ducts
which creates pressure in the liver which is right next to the heart and that can create a pulse rate
situation so if you start keto and you're adding all this extra fat from these keto bombs or you're
eating all this butter or you're adding mct oil you might want to just consume the fat
that normally comes with the protein until you can build up that bile reserve and at the same time
take some good gallbladder support and i'll put a link down below if you want more information
on that all right so let's go through the list of things that you can do if you're having more fat
maybe reduce the fat take bile salts number one number two increase your potassium and magnesium
from the foods or salads and you can also get it in electrolyte powder as well number three
decrease the amount of protein if you're on a high protein diet and make sure it's a moderate amount
of protein okay because too much protein connect as a stimulant and that can rev up the engine
and especially if you're deficient in potassium you can actually prevent someone sleep by having
too much protein all right number four tone down the amount of exercise you're doing and
the intensity of exercise if you're doing crossfit you might want to not do crossfit
because your recovery might be too low number five cut down some of the caffeine
i always recommend just doing one cup of coffee per day if i do more than one cup
of coffee and i'm talking like a small cup that will affect my sleep so watch the caffeine on that
number six low carb number seven go on long walks in nature very important and number eight
regulate your breathing so when you're sleeping at night you may find that your breathing is erratic
or you're in the stress mode with this breathing so really slow down and regulate the breathing
in and out so the inhalation is the same as the exhalation and focus on that you can even focus
on your stomach coming out your stomach coming in and that breathing and that will tend to help you
actually control the autonomic nervous system because you're actively affecting your breathing
which then can affect that part of the nervous system all right thanks for watching so if you're

someone had a question related to
grinding of the teeth at night
could it be a vitamin deficiency and the
answer is
yes it could be and that vitamin
deficiency is vitamin
d now what is the association between
grinding of the teeth
ruxism and vitamin d well there are
so many sleep disorders including sleep
apnea
different types of insomnia including
cramps in your feet at night that are
related to
low levels of vitamin d now it could
also mean that you're deficient in
calcium or magnesium
now if you're going to take calcium make
sure you don't take too much if you take
too much
it can actually create the same symptoms
as a calcium deficiency which i will do
a video on that
so it might be a good idea to take a
small amount of calcium or just get your
calcium
from food now also vitamin d deficiency
is also associated with anxiety
so if you're trying to sleep at night
with a vitamin d deficiency
the anxiety alone can cause you to grind
your teeth
so a simple solution to find out if this
is the cause of your problem
is just take about 10 000 iu's of
vitamin d3
at dinner time and just make sure that
that dinner also includes a little
cheese so you get your calcium
and then see if you observe any
improvements with grinding the teeth
now the difficult thing about this is to
know if you are grinding your teeth less
because you're usually sleeping and you
don't even know you're grinding your
teeth
so you're going to have to figure that
one out there is some good data to show
that vitamin d
deficiency is associated with bruxism

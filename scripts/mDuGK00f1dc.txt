hey everyone today i have another
special guest
ivor cummins is here welcome i iver how
you doing
hey eric great to see you again good
seeing you too
so uh ivor has been to both of my
summits the keto summit and he always
has
incredible information he's an expert in
cholesterol cardiovascular health and
also
calcium in the arteries which he is
going to be talking about but
so so there's also a relationship
between
um the risk factors for this uh
situation that we're in right now uh
maybe you wanna
mention that or talk about that
yeah eric i've actually the last few
weeks i've kind of diverted my attention
from cardiovascular and metabolic and
all the usual stuff to this big issue
and um partly because i'm fascinated
it's it's an absolutely fascinating
challenge
and tragic one for many people of course
we won't forget that
uh but also because the world out there
is so focused on it that right now
is probably not the perfect time to be
doing my
usual stuff because there's such a
hunger to know more about this and i'm
very well positioned to decode
the science for people so i've been
doing a lot of work on it
and yeah as you just said i mean the
risk factors for corona it's so
striking hypertension cardiovascular
disease copd
all the classic signs of insulin
resistance or leptin
resistance syndrome which is an epidemic
in our modern world
and we saw that from the china data at
the very start i picked up on it
way back and i said wow this is hitting
the very people
that the heart disease hits right it's
the same people the same metabolic
issues fascinating fascinating um you
know for those people that don't know
um see you're an engineer and i assume
like i think
electrical engineer but no it's a
biochemical engineer
biochemical yeah which is a completely
different
uh animal because you have to know
chemistry and biology
and all this stuff so you can read the
research and understand it and pull
strings
and which is very very interesting so i
just want to make that
note which is important yeah
you do need the expertise now that was
my primary degree and then i spent
a couple of decades slightly different
industries
but you never really forget and
interestingly in college doing
biochemical
the biochemistry classes in the in the
various years
they were the ones that were my most
favorites
they could because they were fascinating
you know we did genetics we did all of
the
citric acid cycle all metabolism and
we actually did a lot of that stuff
fascinating but then my
my job i didn't really use it much but
many years later of course eight years
ago when i had
poor blood test results i had to go back
in and research
and answer the questions so it's been
great to go back to it yeah
oh that's great yeah so the uh risk
factor
for um the colbit you have um
uh high blood pressure is a tablet list
cardiovascular obesity
diabetes insulin resistance
i mean that all just comes down to this
insulin resistance thing
it does exactly and copd as well but
that's largely connected too
so the orthodoxy or
the establishment is seeing these as all
these different things but of course you
and i know
they all go back to the same roots of
insulin resistance
and maybe a little thing to add as well
is leptin
resistance so way back at the start of
this whole issue i
interviewed dr ron rosedale he's kind of
a genius i think
and he's stuck in india where he works
to help with their diabetes epidemic
and obesity epidemic and he was the guy
who actually originally 25
30 years ago he discovered the crucial
nature of
insulin and measuring insulin and leptin
another hormone
and he actually worked out originally
that
of course the atkins diet the keto diet
is correct
a no-brainer because you keep your
insulin and leptin low
and you keep your glucose low and that
is the best thing for long life and
health
but he went through with me in a full
hour-long podcast
how leptin resistance for which is kind
of the same as insulin resistant to
anyone listening
leptin resistance is the kind of
core part of a poor immune function
and without going into detail he went
through how leptin
not only when your leptin signaling is
disrupted
when you're insulin resistant which are
leptin signaling being disruptive
completely undermines your immune system
and all of the processes that cause the
issues with this virus
and leptin is even actively involved in
the immune system it's part of your
immune response
and if you've disrupted that signaling
because you've become overweight and
insulin resistant
leptin cannot do its immune function job
correctly
so again without going into the weeds
it's so intimately connected
now aren't people um they're associating
leptin with
hunger appetite right
yeah so leptin is a fat cell hormone but
it's also
excreted and used in many other places
but generally leptin is part of your
appetite control system
and if you eat and your fat cells you
know expand
the leptin signal tells you long term
that you're getting enough food and it
reduces your appetite
the tragedy is if you become leptin
resistant
the system doesn't hear the signal
anymore
and then the appetite is not controlled
so it's very like insulin resistance
but also there's one special challenge
which is a corner case very interesting
that sometimes people who are middle
aged particularly females
when they actually lose a lot of weight
and they lose a lot of fat cells
they become low leptin which is very
healthy
low leptin is healthy but sometimes the
lower leptin
tends to trigger a little bit of
appetite
and that and that can make it hard for
people who've lost weight who hit a
plateau
you know they're lower leptin now and it
tends to keep the appetite triggered
so you just need to learn to understand
that and
and overcome it but yeah now the things
that uh
correct or improve insulin resistance
they're the same things that
improve the leptin absolutely for the
person in the street so to speak
the beauty of it is if you want to get
into the science that's great but leptin
resistance
insulin resistance there's no real
separation in terms of what you do
to stop them happening or what you do to
make them worse
they're really tight at the at the hip
now is there any relationship between um
the metabolic syndrome issues
and uh ace2 inhibitors
ah the ace2 inhibitors yeah so
dr rosedale actually went through that
in some detail
a lot of people think that maybe the
ace2 inhibitors
the drugs are causing maybe the higher
susceptibility
and what dr rosedale pointed out was
that's not necessarily the case that
your ace receptors they're actually
proteins
just because there's more of them
doesn't mean necessarily
that you'll draw in more virus
there were studies he quoted so i think
that
it's a bit simplistic to say that
the drugs for hypertension are causing
more ace receptors and bringing in the
virus
i think what is probably more likely is
the kinds of people who are on those
drugs
they suffer from insulin and leptin
resistance right they're given to people
with hypertension
and most hypertension is undiagnosed
insulin resistance
so the drugs associate the blood
pressure drugs associate with worse
outcomes but but it's really confounded
i think
it's just that they give the drugs to
diabetics
overwhelmingly and people with
hypertension
and it's really those people's metabolic
problems
that's really linking to the worse
outcomes and and the
challenges wow so when you talk to this
uh
doctor did he uh mention
the susceptibility goes up when you um
for um when you have leptin resistance
and then the immune system goes down and
then the virus could
potentially take over is that was that
the connection or
yeah absolutely that uh leptin
resistance like insulin resistance
it's like a smelly room you no longer
kind of
smell after a while in the smelly room
and when your body is
subjected to high leptin and high
insulin
you can your body no longer hears the
signals and that's when things go crazy
he also stressed that the leptin itself
is a part of the immune system response
a very
very direct part and in fact
il-6 which they're all talking about
drugs
because this issue this virus causes a
cytokine storm
or it causes your immune system to send
out
a whole load of attack vehicles right to
attack
the virus attack cells with the virus
but what actually happens that hurts
people
is your own immune system goes overboard
and ends up killing a lot of other cells
and basically bringing it down down the
sinkhole
and ron had a great way of describing it
he said your immune system is very
powerful but
what happens with this virus is your
immune system comes out with all these
cytokines like machine guns
you know shock and awe and firing all
over the place
and sure they kill cells with the virus
and they kill the virus
but they kill a lot of other stuff too
including the person
so leptin he described as a very
important part of
modulating or controlling that response
and when you're leptin resistant not
only does it stop your immune system
doing what it should do properly but it
also
fails to control your immune system from
doing what it shouldn't do
so on every side of this leptin
resistance
sits at the seat yeah off the modern
population susceptibility
and if we were all insulin sensitive and
leptin sensitive
at a rough guess we'd probably have 10
times less
impact from this and people might not be
aware but worldwide
or in europe this virus is looking like
it will cause around three times
more excess deaths than the 2018 flu
season
so the 2018 flu season if you look up
the all-cause mortality in europe
caused around 180 000 extra deaths
um in the peak of the winter in 18
in 700 million people in europe so 180
000 currently corona has caused around
230
000 extra deaths so it's not too much
higher than 18
and the way the curves are going where
the deaths are coming down now in nearly
all countries
it looks like it might be three times
worse than 2018 flu
so just to put things in perspective
that's the way it looks
and of course if it was 10 times less
bad
no one would notice just like in 18.
right exactly um when we talk about the
cytokine storm we're talking about an
inflammatory
uh situation where you have these
cytokines which are um the ones we're
talking about are
there's two different there's like
community cytokines have several
um functions one is a communication
signaling the other is a yeah pro and
anti-inflammatories
when we're talking about the
inflammatory ones that go in there and
just create all the damage so your
immune system is creating the damage
um and i think that um you also have on
the
innate part of the immune system now i'm
sorry the adaptive
you have the t regulatory
cells and those t they're like to
suppress ourselves they're the
the firemen that can put out the fire
but they get weak
so sometimes people think it's an
overreacting immune system like it's a
a real strong immune system but actually
it's weak because
they're out of balance we don't have
this buffer we don't have the brake pads
it's all accelerator
and then the body just starts to go down
from there
now is there any relationship because we
know that vitamin d
obviously suppresses the cytokines and
it also
improves these t regulatory cells is
there any relationship between vitamin d
and
leptin or there
there is and again it could get
complicated here but
the recent studies from vitamin d are
fascinating and actually i think you had
a youtube video on one of them the other
day with the 780 people the indonesian
one yeah
yeah yeah so these are
incredible because one came out with
around 230 people i think from the
philippines
very interesting but very early and then
the indonesian one with 780 people
and that was fantastic because when
people get older
they tend to have lower d so maybe it's
just that they were older people got
worse outcomes
but those guys corrected for age
statistically and they corrected
for sex and corrected for comorbidities
or other illnesses
so that study was stunning but the long
story is there's four studies now but
the upshot of it is
four studies out on humans on corona and
vitamin d
and rough and tough if you're below 30
nanograms which is my rule i like to be
at 45 but
below 30 is where i'd worry below 30
people have
10 times the risk of of severe outcome
or death
from this virus now to put things in
perspective for people
the who told us that meat might cause
cancer
based on their studies which showed me
was maybe 1.1 times more likely
for you to have cancer which is a joke
if you're below
two times or double the risk the study
is a joke really
but this is 10 times and the link to
leptin is that
the thing about vitamin d is you can be
low on vitamin d
and it can cause the problems with the
immune system like not modulating or
controlling it and many other things
but the other thing vitamin d is is a
master marker
because if your leptin are insulin
resistant obese
with dysfunctional visceral fat
low low adiponectin all these things
around the metabolic disease that we're
always talking about that keto
fixes well people in that bad state
it drives down your d status
so interestingly you can certainly push
up your d with supplements but some
people who are inflamed in
that state they really need to fix their
diet and get
sunshine and fresh air and get healthy
because some people the supplements find
it very hard to rise their vitamin d
but if they start eating the right thing
doing the right stuff
their vitamin d can rise even if they
don't really have supplements
so people need to know it's a two-hander
there's lots of things that drive low
vitamin d
in that blood test one of them is not
having enough d
you know get your supplements in the
winter get your sun
but the other thing is that d is marker
telling you
you may have an inflammatory problem so
it's a great marker for all the leptin
resistance and stuff we were talking
about
fascinating you also have the fatter you
are the more
difficult it is to convert and absorb
the vitamin d through the skin so you
have that
and then you have um i mean for those of
you that haven't
seen this video um they put people in i
guess it was three groups
and the group that had normal amounts of
vitamin d
i think the mortality rate was four
percent and the one that was
uh insufficient of vitamin d
the mortality rate was 88 the one that
was deficient
in vitamin d had a mortality rate what
was it 99
i'm like that's close to that
so it's that's significant
it was stunning because you know i i
always have enemies on twitter you know
the anti-low-carb anti-keto
pro-statin crew you know and i'm always
arguing with them and it's it's okay
but they came out against me for
promoting and explaining and describing
these studies
and they don't like them and they said
they're associational so yes they're not
a placebo
randomized controlled trial where you
give someone more vitamin d
and prove that they have better outcomes
but in associational studies like i
mentioned
if the risk ratio or risk multiplier you
see
is less than two times you know that's
kind of weak
but when it's 10 times you know
that fulfills the criteria for serious
causality yeah and these are powerful
studies
right oh my gosh it's incredible um i
know um
this there's several drugs coming up
there and i know there's a push to have
um
double-blinded controlled studies
clinical trials the whole thing right
there's this big push
and that's cool that's very cool and i
think we need to have that
um but my question is will they be doing
that for the vaccine
that's a that would be interesting
question i highly doubt it
but they should they're pushing that but
they
somehow they get out of doing that with
the vaccine because you want these
things safe
so yeah and i think the problem with the
vaccine it's almost like we have to
self-censor
ourselves i find it difficult to even
talk about the science i can talk about
statins no problem and cholesterol not
being a cause
all these controversial things no
problem but they've created an
environment where if you even talk about
safety and vaccines you get accused of
being what they say
anti-vaxx and the problem is that
that's the day that science ends when no
one can no longer
speak freely and discuss data and
unfortunately that's kind of what's
happened with these vaccines
so my mind is the original vaccines the
measles and all those things from years
ago were pretty
solid as a rock and proven out
it's just nowadays there's around 20 new
ones
and my perception is that they're not
getting the
due diligence and very careful testing
they may be showed
it's almost like there's always new ones
and they're just boom boom boom boom
boom
and it it can be a danger when there's a
worldwide
panic even though to be quite honest as
i said it's three times worse it looks
like than 2018
so it's not exactly a panic
it shouldn't be a panic but i think
there's a feeling of panic
and i hope people don't cut corners
because there's a feeling of panic
i think a lot of european countries have
done
mild lockdowns they're now coming down
in the number of fatalities
they were overwhelmingly very aged
people
and people with with medical conditions
they're not that they're not
there yeah they're important too of
course don't get me wrong
but we have to have a perspective on
this and the curves are coming down
and a dozen european countries are
lifting restrictions
and the summer's coming in and
interestingly coronavirus family has
been researched
for 30 years and there's one thing
that's unique
coronaviruses are highly seasonal and
all
previous studies have shown coronavirus
family
to spike in the winter in the northern
hemisphere
and then to disappear in the summer so
we may have really good news if the
summer
makes this corona behave like others if
people the
the debt rates are falling the spread
happens
and there may not be a need for a
vaccine at all
perhaps i think you're right on that in
fact um i'm going to be releasing
a video on that exact topic um on
temperature and humidity
and how it's it's it it'll start to
actually get better and better
um it's you know i thought that we're
supposed to think critically
as long as it's not critical to certain
groups of science or whatever scientist
um i want to switch gears um a good
friend of yours
uh did a really great movie recently
can you can you tell us a little bit
about that
yeah that'd be great eric because we're
trying to get the message out there so
this is super
so back to the calcification scan and
just a really quick reminder for people
so again thinking risk ratios if you
have really weird cholesterol you might
be 1.3
times more likely to have a problem but
it's very noisy
if you have hypertension maybe 1.7 times
more likely to have a heart attack in
the next 10 years
but if you take get a scan a calcium
scan
cac score it sees the calcium and the
inflammation uh caused calcium buildup
in the arteries in your heart in a
five-minute scan
and the amount of that you have that can
be a 10
times risk for a heart attack in the
next 10 years
or even 20 times so this quick 5-minute
scan for 100 bucks
it tells you the truth tells your risk
so what we did in the movie is we got
the heroes of the 1991
uh big final in ireland in irish
football
so there's a little bit irish football
in there and we got them now
in their late 50s and we scanned 45 of
them
and the key thing was that all of them
their doctors said they were fine
there was no need for any treatments
they were all healthy
good to go and we scanned them and we
picked up 9 out of 45 with
super high scores and two or three of
them have since had emergency surgery
based on the scan result which saved
their life
and one even had a heart attack just
before the surgery but luckily he was
okay
but we were able to walk in there and
find that out
and their doctors were shocked you know
so really important this scan it's
crucial
and not just for heavyweight people or
smokers
we've got tons of toffee or
slim people who are fat inside and the
scan will tell you who's at risk
but what we did is one guy we picked our
hero
so a few of the guys took measures to
stop their score getting higher over the
year
and we had great success but i won't
give away the movie
but our hero we followed patty o'rourke
who's the captain of one of the teams
back in 91
quite famous in ireland and he said guys
what should i do and guess what eric
everything we said he should do you
would agree with
and it involved eliminating refined
carbohydrates he had to get rid of the
breads the banana breads
you know the cereals and he began to eat
real food
you know meat fish and eggs and real
food and he got
a blood glucose meter and he was
checking himself a few times a day and
keeping a log i mean this guy
did the work and vitamins and minerals
you know magnesium
k2 you know fish oils
he was taking a full set of those
and magnesium potassium i think and at
the end of the year we re-scanned them
and let's just say it's a very happy
story he
booked the trend yeah wow in fact we had
three cardiologists as part of the movie
including william wheatbeller
ellie davis and an australian cardio and
a british cardiologist
who's actually in the movie uh scott
murray
and scott's quote at the end was you
know this
this is a big disrupter for cardiology
and preventative cardiology and what
we've done here in this film
uh opens up a bright new future of
genuine prevention in the coming decades
and i think that's true so yeah i'm
gonna put a link down below you guys
need to check this movie out
um i've heard it's incredible
um go ahead
oh yeah it's gonna yeah it's extra time
movie dot com
and uh absolute super if you can put a
link but it'll really help us because
this whole issue
our funder and sponsor his business has
been hit really
really bad with this virus issue and you
know it'll just help us get the message
out if people share it enjoy it
download our stream and uh yeah we put a
year and a half's work in
and yeah it'd be great if people could
check it out but they'll also find out a
lot
as well you know it's not all one way i
just want to tell you guys what he's
talking
about this uh uh i mean even if you're
on keto or not on keto
you go to the doctor and they say oh
you're
everything's fine but your ldl is high
and i hear this all the time even
though i was like ldl is high of course
they're not measuring the
the uh the particles they're not
measuring the uh
what type of ldl there's a couple
different kinds
and when you're consuming more fat in
the diet you're going to have
maybe some higher ldl in it but the type
is not the
the small dense type that can invade the
arteries and create inflammatory markers
it's
it's the large buoyant thing that's
floating through the uh
the bloodstream and to to know that
you know you can get another test that's
a little bit more in-depth which i think
is a good idea
um but hands down as far as the
indicators are
predictive um i guess indicator for
cardiovascular actually i think it's all
all mortality
if i'm not mistaken one of the best
predictors for
all mortality is the cac test right
correct me if i'm yeah for sure and in
fact we saw it yet again
in all our 45 people we did blood tests
and the only things that gave a hint
of the high score high scoring people
was low hdl
maybe high triglycerides kind of
surfaced
and hba1c which you probably explained
to people before blood sugar
but otherwise the ldl the total
cholesterol
it predicted nothing so we got nine guys
with massive scores
and your your ldl total that they had
you could tell nothing it could be low
medium
noise so the calcium scan bypasses all
those
guesswork blood tests and goes straight
to do you
have disease what is your risk when the
body uh
is inflamed and that you're getting
oxidative damage in the arteries the
body's going to try to heal it with
eventually calcium and it's a real
simple test i had it done
and it's very inexpensive and you can
pick up information it's on a scale
you want it to be zero sometimes it's
really high sometimes it's not but from
that score
you can get a lot of information it is
one of the best predictors
of mortality um and so
also if you haven't if you guys don't
know about ivor
i'll put a link on his website as well
because in his youtube channel because
i mean he he has studied this stuff like
forever and yes
he knows pretty much i don't know anyone
who knows more than him about this topic
uh the calcium that builds up in the
arteries so um
learn more about it and um if you
have a high score there's tons of
solutions
um but the worst thing is having a high
score and not even
getting the test and not even knowing
about it and then being surprised one
day and going
why did it end up in the hospital or
just dying so it is such a
simple cheap test everyone should get it
done but you need to know about what it
is
yeah great no thanks for that eric
absolutely and you know so many
tragedies vastly higher numbers will die
from chronic disease alzheimer's heart
disease than our current issue
which will pass and like you say people
will die and they never
had a chance to take action and if you
do get a very high score which means you
have a very high risk
if you intervene and take action with a
lot of what you say eric
and you know vitamins minerals keto get
your
sugars down insulin down you take action
you can stop that score rising
and after a year or so if you've slowed
it down and stopped it going up
that makes you almost as safe as if you
got a zero in the first place
so a high score is not a sentence a high
score just means hey i gotta do all the
right stuff
fix the causes that drove this
progressive disease
and then in a year or two come back and
you find out ah
you know it was going up and up and up
and now you know what it's slowed down
and that means you're
really really safe compared to where you
were you know
that's the key that's awesome thanks so
much i
appreciate it and then people are going
to really get a lot out of this so
thank you thank you eric thanks

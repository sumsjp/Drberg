overeating is not just triggered by the msg and sugar and processed foods
it's triggered by the flavorings you know nowadays nothing tastes like anything anymore things
becoming more bland okay tomatoes for example just completely void and empty of any nutrition it's
like eating like nothing yet i remember growing up taking this tomato from our garden it was just
incredible you know i did a trip a while ago to italy and um i heard about these tomatoes they
were so amazing right and we were going on a food tour so we had to meet at this court courtyard
so as we're waiting for the tour guide i look across the street and there was a little
little shop that had vegetables so i walked over there and i noticed they had some tomatoes
and so i bought a little bag i mean it must have been probably the equivalent of two tomatoes but
it was these small little tomatoes so i started eating them and they were delicious it was amazing
the flavor the taste of those tomatoes so i come back to my wife karen and i'm
like you're not gonna believe how delicious these tomatoes were she goes did you bring me any i go
uh actually i ate them all um but here's the point i was so satisfied i was so
filled when i went on the tour i literally couldn't eat anything else because i was so
filled up why because of the nutrients in those tomatoes i don't know if you know this but
for example chicken breast okay you'd buy chicken breasts at the store skinless chicken breasts did
you realize they have to now put chicken flavor in the chicken to make it taste like chicken
or else it'll just taste like nothing in fact next time you buy chicken look at the label you'll
see chicken chicken broth and flavorings okay they're trying to make it taste like chicken the
flavorings trigger eating okay it makes you want to eat them in fact it gives you a lot of pleasure
the problem is that there's empty calories in that processed food there's low nutrients
and because there's low nutrients when you're going to eat way more than you normally would
not to mention the sugar the msg the fat the salt and all that that's a whole different thing now
flavors are really a survival mechanism in nature the foods with the highest nutrients
have the most flavors so you're attracted to those flavors you'll end up getting the
most nutrients and you'll survive better but now we have this artificial flavoring thing
and even though it's natural flavorings the brain doesn't know the difference so this is
why you are addicted to those chips late at night now if you do the keto desserts or snacks okay
you may have already found that out because it's very difficult to consume a lot of keto
desserts or those keto bombs and yes they have a lot of fat but there's also more nutrients they're
not empty which is a good thing so that's why you can get by with having just a small amount of this
if you're new to this concept i challenge you to make a substitution for these dessert and
sweet foods things like that and start doing keto friendly low carb nutrient dense like
snacks or desserts of course you'd want to eat the snack at the meal not in between
so your focus should be not just on flavors but the nutrients and that way you can actually
have this turn off mechanism and actually be satisfied which is going to be a very good thing

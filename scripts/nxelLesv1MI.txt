so i've done quite a few videos on different spices but i have not done one on paprika so we're
going to talk about the health benefits of paprika so paprika is made from dried red peppers the mild
versions and it became very popular in hungary in the late 19th century so when we're talking about
the health benefits of spices we're talking about the various phytonutrients in spices
and they're usually connected to color pigments and so in paprika we have various colors ranging
from yellow to orange to red so let's start with the yellow and orange pigment phytonutrients okay
you have alpha carotene and beta-carotene these are precursors to vitamin a but the benefits
from paprika are not actually vitamin a it's in the actual precursors to vitamin a
both alpha-carotene and beta-carotene then we have another one called zeaxanthin and paprika is
loaded with zeaxanthin and then we have lutein so both zeaxanthin and lutein are great for the eye
in preventing age-related macular degeneration as well as cataracts then we have another one called
beta cryptoxanthin and those are all the yellow orange pigments and then we get into the red
pigments which include capsaicin and capsulorubin so collectively all these phytonutrient chemicals
create some really cool effects in the eye in protecting the eye against degenerative problems
you have anti-inflammatory properties you have anti-cancer risk they have potential anti-cancer
properties now when i say potential i mean it's really impossible to isolate and do a study
on these phytonutrients to help you with cancer because there's so many variables you have the
diet you have the person's history but there is some exciting research on the potential of
contributing to decreasing the risk of cancer so it's something that could help you they also show
potential anti-diabetic effects the same thing applies if you are not changing your diet and
you're just using phytonutrients and paprika thinking that's that's going to help you with
cancer it's not going to help with cancer you have to do the whole package and also there's
some interesting benefits in suppressing uv induced skin damage with these phytonutrients
so with all the data on the benefits of using various spices to improve your health
definitely include paprika as one of your spices you use especially for vision

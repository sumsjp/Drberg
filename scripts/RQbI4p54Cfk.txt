now i've done other videos on the importance of omega-3 fatty acids
but i want to talk about how you can spike your omega-3 fatty acid levels
just using purified bile salts the liver makes bile okay it's like a detergent
that helps break down fats and it makes what's called primary bile
salts in your colon you have microbes that make secondary bile salts so you
have two different sources and they kind of work together to be
recycled to help you digest and extract key things you need
from fat fat in your body is used for many things
one is for fuel and there's also non-fuel
purposes for fat as well for example you have the fat cycle vitamins vitamin
a d e k 1 k 2. that's very very necessary
but you also have another group of fats that's really really important
and that's the essential fatty acids i'm talking about the omega-6
and the omega-3 and you actually need both of these right here the problem is
the average american is way way way too
heavy on the omega-6 and barely has any omega-3 fatty acids
and there's a really simple cool test that you can
figure out what your ratios are with a simple
drop of blood i will put a link down below to get more information on that
but typically the average person needs to increase more omega-3s
and decrease the omega-6 this would be like
corn oil soy oil canola oil safflow oil all those right here this one would be
like dha and epa these type of fats are very
anti-inflammatory these type of fats are very inflammatory so what are the
symptoms that could occur if you're low on
omega-3 and you're too high and omega-6 well number one you're going to have
inflammation okay number two you're more at risk for heart
problems number three you're going to have
problems with your vision could be a lot of different
vision problems next one you can have cognitive issues because
dhea supplies a good portion of the brain
and without dha it can affect the cognitive function
as well as your mood simply because your hormones also need
omega-3 fatty acids there's one thing about
making sure you get these from the diet but there's the other problem
of making sure they're broken down and getting absorbed
and i believe a great majority of the population just does not have
enough bile because they have liver damage
to be able to really break down the essential fatty acids so
even though they're consuming oils and taking supplements they're not really
seeing the benefits bile salts can help you with that and if
you need more information about bile salts i put a link down below
the other thing to focus on which is also
missing is the source of the majority of omega-3 fatty acids
fish and shellfish okay and you can also do
canned sardines canned tuna to get omega-3 a while ago i had this
idea in my head that i thought that if you're going to can
fish it's going to destroy all the omega-3 fatty acids okay
and so i did a video on that and then i felt a little weird about
not actually testing it myself so i i basically spent four thousand dollars
and i sent uh some canned tuna and canned sardines
to the lab to have it independently tested to see
if it actually had any omega-3 fatty acids because they have to heat up
this fish before when they can it right guess what it was loaded with omega-3
fatty acids both dhea and epa so apparently
they're able to survive that amount of heat and i did put that video down below
where i get into the amounts and the testing and all that you can check it
out but the point is that we need to consume
more fish more shellfish and if you want to do the
can you can do that as well because that will have the omega-3
i'm just emphasizing the importance of this right here
one of the top symptoms of an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency is
scaly dry skin so if you have that then we know that
you're deficient in that also another symptom would be skin
atrophy okay so your skin is starting to become
loose it's not as toned that's an omega-3
fatty acid deficiency your memory is not that sharp that's
another symptom and the last one is any type of itis you
know arthritis bursitis tendinitis
because a lack of omega-3 puts your body in a state where you're inflamed
in the joints and in other places number one make sure you include more fish
and you can also do fish oils or even better yet cod liver oil because that
will give you not just dha and epa but also vitamin a
and vitamin d and if you find that it's not breaking down you may need to
get some purified bile salts and i put a link down below for more
information on that all right thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains

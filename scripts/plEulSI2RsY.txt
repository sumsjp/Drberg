hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the sodium
Neff oh my gosh this is a big one you know there's people that say that sodium
is the worst thing you can consume but let's take a look at this they've only
done one study that shows any relationship between high blood pressure
and consuming sodium and it was called the - sodium study but they failed to
kind of omit unless you read the study they didn't tell you they also lower the
sugar in their diets the glucose so honestly that's really what created the
lower blood pressure more than the salt okay so even a recent study that
involves 6,000 people showed that there is no strong evidence in relationship
between eating salt or sodium and increasing blood pressure now why would
that be simply because sodium is an essential mineral what does that mean it
means you it's necessary for survival you can't live without sodium but you
need to have it in the right amounts we need about a thousand milligrams a day
that's probably a quarter teaspoon a day of salt but realize that salt is sodium
chloride not just sodium so about half of that sodium chloride is sodium okay
so you need a little bit more salt than you do sodium so I'll show you what kind
to get in a second but but the point is that we need this sodium to regulate
your heart your fluids it acts like an electrolyte that allows the balance of
fluid and it controls the volume of fluid through your body so it works with
other minerals to maintain that balance so without that essential mineral you
have all sorts of problems with your muscle your heart
your brain you need that number two I'm sorry number three low sodium in the
blood there's a condition of low sodium the blood called hyponatremia now what
is that that's just simply low sodium in the
blood and that's from drinking lots of water that people tell you to do and
very little salt so the doctors like don't need salt drink a lot of water
you're just flushing out the electrolyte so you're going to end up with a very
low sodium in the blood which you're setting yourself up for a lot of heart
problems swelling in the brain can people die of hyponatremia so that
you if you have never seen though my water myth video watch that because too
much water is not not good you want to drink when you're thirsty so how do you
know if you need sodium well do you crave salt then you need it
okay fluid retention now if you have fluid retention in your legs or your
fingers or your body obviously there's there's probably too much sodium in your
body but so instead of reducing sodium it's much more important to raise the
other electrolyte that sodium works with and that's called potassium we need
about four times a little more than four times the amount of potassium then we do
sodium where do you get potassium vegetables do you eat enough vegetables
probably not some people have two cups today you need actually seven to eight
to nine cups to get the potassium to balance out the sodium because an
average person consumes about thirty four hundred milligrams of sodium and
only a thousand milligrams of potassium so the ratios are off so they will get
fluid retention in some period of time and so what you don't want to do is you
don't want to worry about lowering yourself just increase your potassium
and don't have the hidden salts that a lot of people are exposed to the MSG
monosodium glutamate from fast-food restaurants eating sugar depletes
potassium and retain sodium that's why you can gain a water a pound of water
after consuming some sugar so again it's the junk food it's the msg that that
increases the sodium and by the way you never want to consume one mineral by
itself you want to consume it in a complex like sea salt
okay versus just taking sodium all right so now we have talked about fluid of
tension low adrenal glands if your adrenal glands are burnt out you're not
going to have the hormone specifically there's hormone called aldosterone
there's one called there's a bunch of them called mineral corticoids which are
hormones that regulate minerals specifically salt potassium so what
happens with the adrenal is you lose salt so you crave salt let's say at
night you get home and you're burnt out you're tired and you're craving salt so
you consume sea salt then you probably want some sweet and some salt
together because people that are low in minerals are also have low blood sugar
issues if glucose issues so your just when you consume that your energy starts
coming up your cells are trying to demand it but really it's an adrenal
situation okay so what type of salt is the best Himalayan salt is the best salt
why because it's salt from a mountaintop which used to be an ocean a long time
ago it's the most pure unpolluted sea salt you don't want to get the sea salt
that is in the current environment now because you're just getting a lot of
sewage in there and a lot of chemicals so get pink Himalayan salt
there is a black Himalayan salt that you could get which high in sulfur the only
thing with that is it tastes like eggs okay and a lot of people don't like the
taste if you can stand it and put on your eggs that would be a much better
salt it's called black Himalayan salt because that sulfur is really good for
the liver it's good for a detoxifying mineral it's good for a lot of skin
conditions but again it has a bad odor to it some people can't do it but think
about what sulfur is in its in all the cruciferous it's in kale broccoli
Brussels sprouts cabbage it's all the sulfur type minnow so definitely
radishes that actually help detoxify the liver so if you can stand it go ahead
and get it if not get the pink version but go ahead and use that and use it
don't be afraid to use it as long as you increase your potassium with your
vegetables you're totally okay all right I'll see you in the next video

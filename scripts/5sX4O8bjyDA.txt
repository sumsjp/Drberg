you know there's this idea that if you have a fatty liver it's an isolated problem it's an
individual problem that is probably not related to other organs that is actually not quite true
so if you have a fatty liver you also have fatty organs they should really call a fatty liver just
fatty organs because the fat is going to spill off into your muscles into your heart and vessels
into the pancreas into the kidney and many other organs now what's the significance of that
well the more fat you have in your organs the less
function you're going to have in those organs and you're also going to get inflammation
so for example the more fat in your liver the less your liver is going to be able to produce bile
the less your liver is going to be able to convert poisons into harmless particles the less the liver
is going to make certain proteins in your blood which end up giving you edema in your
legs the less the liver is going to make certain clotting factors and the more you're going to have
bleeding and issues with if you bruise yourself one of the best predictors for a fatty liver
is alt that's a liver enzyme test so if you have high alt in as a blood test chances are you have a
fatty liver another good test would be high levels of triglycerides probably because the body now
doesn't have the capacity of bile salts or bile salt production to be able to emulsify and break
down those triglycerides and get rid of them and the other problem with the fatty liver is up to 20
of people with a fatty liver end up having cirrhosis that's scar tissue of the liver
it's much more serious and you have a lot of other problems including being on the list for a liver
transplant now the question is how do you reverse a fatty liver if you haven't seen my video on how
to reduce liver fat by 50 in 14 days i put a link down below but you need to get on a low
carb diet you need to reduce your insulin when you reduce your insulin another hormone comes in there
called glucagon and glucagon rapidly burns fat it turns fat into ketones and glucagon is triggered
by low insulin or a low carb diet all right thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

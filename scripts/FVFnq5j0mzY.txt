now if you have adhd or your child has it you may want to consider using cod liver oil
so adhd stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder so it's a combination between a lack of
attention and focus and restlessness can't sit still now cod liver oil is very very
interesting because it has not only dha and epa which are omega-3 fatty acids
but it also has vitamin d and vitamin a whereas fish oil really only has these
two right here and not much of those two and so cod of oil has some additional benefits
and you can get caliber oil in supplements but you can also get it as cod liver in a can
make sure you get the wild caught version but it's quite delicious but the question is why
would cod liver oil that's high in dha and epa help someone with focus concentration memory and
learning well this is why your brain is composed of about 60 percent fat your cerebral cortex is 20
dha fat the retina is an extension of your brain it's neurological tissue your neurons which are
brain cells and the synapses which allow for the communication are rich in omega-3 fatty acids
omega-3 fatty acids increase something called brain-derived neurotrophic factor this is the
thing that helps the nerve cells grow in the body and also the omega-3 fatty acids have a
really good anti-inflammatory effect on the brain now in a 2018 meta-analysis randomized controlled
trial it was found that children with adhd had a pretty significant deficiency in both dha and epa
now if you're going to take cardiff oil to improve these symptoms there's a couple things you need to
know number one it's going to take time it could take up to three months for it to work secondly
it's probably not going to work if your diet is not correct now if you're new to my channel
what i'm talking about is if you are on a high carbohydrate diet that's going to prevent this
from working so the combination of being on the right diet and taking this can greatly help now
there's one more remedy to add that i think would be a very powerful thing and that would be vitamin
b1 i would recommend getting this from nutritional yeast because vitamin b1 can greatly handle
the hyperactivity part of this adhd condition so i put some more information down below on this

so we're going to talk about how to get your sinuses really cleared out so you can breathe
and you can smell things but of course it's allergy season and a lot of people are getting
allergies from that but if you have chronic sinus problems all year round that usually is an
infection either a virus fungus it could be mold it could be bacteria but it's living up into the
sinuses so there's several things that you want to do one is use a combination of echinacea oil and
tea tree oil as a mist you can put a couple drops of this in your hot bath in a nebulizer which
basically is turning this liquid into a mist or a neti pot where you're taking hot water putting a
couple drops of each and letting it go up into the sinuses and i'm going to create a separate video
on exactly what's happening but it's going to thin mucus it's going to strengthen your immune system
it's going to reduce inflammation and make it very unfriendly for those pathogens to exist
the next thing i'm going to recommend is to take this orally garlic pills oregano oil pills
and clove pills okay these are my three favorite to act as an antibiotic you
take that internally and it'll actually make it very difficult for the pathogens
to exist the next thing is to drink on a regular basis apple cider vinegar this will do many things
and i've done extensive videos on this but to drink this on a regular basis will help shift
your ph in the right direction to make it very unfriendly for those pathogens to exist
i would recommend to dilute in a glass of water about two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
and you can add other things into it if you want to add ginger or lemon juice but i don't recommend
doing the brags anymore why because if you look in the back the label i don't know how long ago they
started doing this but they started to dilute their apple cider vinegar if you look at the
ingredients it'll say certified organic apples and purified water okay it's at i think five percent
acidity so basically they're diluting it so i found another company that i'm using right now
and this is the one that i like i'll check it out fair trial okay fairchilds by golden
valley vinegar now what i like about this it's straight certified organic apples
and no water it's very very strong and it's the real deal it's raw unfiltered it has the mother
it's unpasteurized so it's very very delicious but this is the one i'm going to recommend
not breaks so anyway you can use this combination to clear out your sinuses
and finally breathe again hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

oh my gosh I'm sorry to tell you this guy's but coconut oil is a poison yes
it's very very dangerous I know it's been given to a lot of cultures over the
last 2,000 years and they didn't have a problem but so it's now just been
recognized by the experts that is very very dangerous
okay guys coconuts are only dangerous if they're traveling at your head and you
don't duck okay that's the only danger in a coconut guys let me just show you
why Bay well I'm just trying to figure who they is consider coconut oil a
poison because if the saturated fat now they didn't do studies then having you
consume coconut oil and having it cause heart attack now
they just ignored that link and went right to the saturated fats okay because
everyone knows that consuming saturated fats will clog your arteries and cause
coronary heart disease I mean that's a fact right that is an example of false
data okay that is false information now the American Heart Association blasted
out there to all the physicians that you need to start replacing the saturated
fat type products with the vegetable oils okay so that's kind of like the the
new thing but what they ignored is these three very large studies the Minnesota
coronary survey experiment the Sydney study and the Women's Health Initiative
I'm going to put the links down below so you can check them out because these
major studies do not show this link at all okay they show that if there is not
a link there and there's a lot more as well now let's just switch over to the
true information okay coconut oil is 70 percent medium chain triglycerides these
type of fats are very very different they're used to make energy they're used
to be converted to ketones for energy and then they bypass the gallbladder so
it's really a low stress fat for the liver in the gallbladder 50% of coconut
oil is lauric acid which has amazing antimicrobial properties it's great for
the immune system and by the way some of the studies that
the American Heart Association used to prove this link is
they're not just using saturated fats these diets were also higher
carbohydrate diets and if you mix higher carbohydrates with high protein or fat
you're gonna get this result right here it's the carbohydrate okay it's the
sugar here's the truth the coconut oil industry did not pay off I'm sorry
sponsor the American Heart Association like some of the other industries like
the food industry and the drug industry which basically spent five hundred and
twenty-one million dollars that was in actually 2011 and 2012 I'm not sure what
it is now but they basically spent a lot of money to get the stamp of approval
okay and there's something else called the heart check food certification where
the American Heart Association basically endorses different products that they
are heart-healthy and I think you have to spend something like seven hundred
thousand dollars a year just to have that endorsement anyway you don't have
to worry about coconut oil being poisonous it's actually a very very
healthy it's been around for a long time and there's also quite a few studies
that show that it actually lowers your cholesterol I'm gonna put those links

hi guys dr. Berg here I want to talk about the problems with soy not only is
most the soy sold in America genetically modified that's a whole different topic
but unless that soy is fermented it gives you a lot of problems okay so the
Japanese had this figured out long time ago they knew they had to ferment soy
into things like nato tempeh miso and tofu to be able to digest them because
if not it's considered an anti nutrient which means it has certain enzyme
blockers that block the absorption of proteins yeah and it also has phytic
acid blocks minerals like calcium magnesium iron but especially zinc yeah
so what happens you might say well I don't consume much soy but check this
out soy is hidden in so many foods it's in pretty much all the oils like the
vegetable oils it's in most those little bars that you get those protein bars
it's soy protein isolates it's in a lot of the different diet shakes that are
out there so you have to start reading labels it's in a lot of the vegetarian
patties and meats and hotdogs and things like that so you want to avoid it why
because it creates a lot of problems not just with an estrogenic effect but an
anti nutrient effect and a GMO effect it has a lot of problems the problem that I
see right now is the infant formulas are mainly soy based it's cheap but it's
creating a situation for our babies so personally I would never in a million
years give an infant a soy based formula not not only do they going to develop
allergies to it it's going to create a lot of nutritional deficiencies because
it's not fermented now do I recommend consuming soy well some people if you
get organic certain fermented soy they can do some of that I don't
come in a lot of it why I've seen people take too much soy and even men I had two
patients come in that started drinking so much soy milk it wasn't even
fermented they started lactating yeah breast milk yeah lactating so it's so
okay it's okay to have some of it if it's fermented but make sure if you do
it it has to be organic or non-gmo if it's organic it's not GMO if it's not
organic it's usually GMO okay so I just want to kind of cover some points about
soy I think too many people are just consuming way too much of the wrong type
of soy all right so I will see you in the next video

hey I'm back and today I'm going to talk about an interesting case study that was
done by a Brazilian doctor working with a patient who had something called
myasthenia gravis this condition is an autoimmune disease that's a condition
where you have any buddies or they call them autoantibodies that are against
our own tissues you can have an autoimmune disease to just about every
single thing in your body this particular autoimmune disease attacks
the junction the connection between your nerves and your muscles okay so that's
what it is and that's going to deplete acetylcholine so you can have a lot of
muscle problems specifically in the skeletal muscle and one of the
treatments that they normally use is steroids
autoimmune conditions produce a lot of inflammation and a steroid is an
anti-inflammatory of course the problem there's a lot of side effects when you
take steroids the amount of vitamin D that this doctor used was between 80,000
and 120,000 international units of vitamin d3 what happened was he was able
to put this patients symptoms in remission okay so of course they don't
ever like to say care or anything like that but in remission means that you
don't have any of the symptoms why would this potentially work and what is a
relationship of vitamin D I've done other videos on this but if you have an
autoimmune condition vitamin D is definitely something that you want to
consider because vitamin D is not even necessarily a vitamin it's hormone like
in an acts like a steroid without the side effects and the other thing that it
does is it supports something called the T regulatory cells and that's part of
the immune system that has a really important function in preventing
autoimmune diseases the other thing that's involved with autoimmune
conditions are viruses and other pathogens and it's not agreed upon what
causes these conditions however there's a lot of links and associations but
obviously it's something that damages certain parts of the immune system and
now what happens is we have friendly-fire where your body is
attacking itself and apparently vitamin D actually supports
these cells now one of the reasons why sometimes you have to use high amounts
of vitamin D to create this effect is that let's say for example this whole
autoimmune condition was triggered by a viral infection these viruses have
strategies of downgrading the receptor for vitamin D leaving you always
deficient and to overcome that that resistance you would have to consume
larger amounts of vitamin D and there's a huge connection between a lot of
autoimmune conditions even MS and a vitamin D deficiency now one of the
concerns that people will have when they take this much vitamin D is this one
condition called hypercalcemia that means high calcium in the blood and what
happens is you may develop kidney stones of course the research isn't definitive
and there's not a lot of studies that say that's going to happen but one of
the things that this brazilian doctor did was to mitigate this or lessen the
risk by omitting any calcium in the diet so it would tell the patient not to
consume cheese for example or take calcium supplements so if he wanted to
lower your risk for kidney stones what you would want to do is you want to
drink at least three and a half to four liters of fluid every single day because
in that way you can prevent the urine from being supersaturated where you
develop a stone the reason I created this video is basically to show you the
relationship between vitamin D and your immune system and potentially even the
possibility of keeping an autoimmune condition in remission with something
natural like vitamin D if you haven't seen my video on MS and vitamin D I'm
gonna put it up right now check it out

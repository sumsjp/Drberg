let's talk about something actually quite amazing cruciferous sprouts now the benefits
of cruciferous sprouts are not about the vitamins or the minerals fatty acids amino acids or even
trace minerals it's about this thing right here phytonutrients and there's quite a few of these
chemical compounds that give amazing health benefits and they're basically just these
three-day-old sprouts that you can actually grow yourself in a little container without even soil
without even having sun and i'm going to talk about the amazing properties that it could
potentially give you there's some human studies that show that these sprouts can decrease h pylori
and gastritis there's animal studies that majorly demonstrate effectiveness in dealing with cancer
now we're talking about broccoli in cauliflower sprouts which can contain up to a hundred
times the sulfurophane which is a phytonutrient compared to adult plants adult broccoli and adult
that's incredible in 1997 professor talalay demonstrated very high levels of cancer protection
with this right here in fact he worked with john hopkins and i do remember in the late 90s you
would see these broccoli sprouts in the grocery store and what they initially did or i think try
to do is get the patents and the broccoli sprouts and i think i had to go to the supreme court they
did not win and then one day all this hype with broccoli sprouts just kind of went away of course
if you can't get the patents on it there's not going to be a lot of money in it but the fact
that john hopkins was involved in backing up these broccoli sprouts tells me that there's
definitely something there because they would not invest the money into this project unless
there was something there certain cruciferous products are highly effective in decreasing
the incidence of tumor cells in breast tissue also these sprouts can induce
carcinogen detoxifying enzymes okay so they're talking about carcinogens
that would be something like this this is the toxicology the science of poisons so in
our environment we have thousands of chemicals and uh quite a few of them are carcinogens in
this book it talks about the relationship of how these poisons cause not just cancer but disease
and thank goodness there's natural things that we can take to dismantle and detoxify
those poisonous chemicals and the vegetables cruciferous especially some of the sprouts
can induce these enzymes so then we can take a poisonous fat-soluble chemical
and convert it into a harmless water-soluble particle and so your liver can detoxify it
and what's really cool about this whole thing is that this chemical in this plant causes apoptosis
selectively now what is apoptosis it's a condition where the cancer cells commit suicide okay
and it's selective only to cancer cells so this chemical will target only cancer cells and not
your own that is just mind-blowing so the next time you're in the store go ahead and pick up some
of the cruciferous sprouts and put a little bit in your salad you don't need much because they're so
concentrated all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

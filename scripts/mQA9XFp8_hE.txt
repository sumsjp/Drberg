I had another question I wanted to answer it with a quick video they were talking
about having hypoglycemia low blood sugar and every time they consume
protein they feel a lot better okay so they wanted to know why protein helps
with hypoglycemia now when I had low blood sugar issues and by the way what
happens is when the blood sugar comes up insulin will then push the blood sugar
down and you can end up with lower blood sugar and people with low blood sugar a
lot of times have a higher amount of insulin in their body and it's pushing
it down and we don't have those counter hormones or counter regulatory hormones
to kind of push it back up so you end up with low blood sugar and the symptoms
are fatigue dizziness irritable nasai dry eyes depression there's all these
different symptoms I remember having hypoglycemia really
bad and I'd really dry irritated eyes then I started consuming protein and I
felt great for years but getting back to the video some people have this idea
that the fuel that the body uses is either glucose sugar or fat or ketones
but protein can be used as a fuel protein can be broken down in the body
into what's called carbon skeletons and that can actually be converted into
glucose okay and the term is gluconeogenesis so your body can make
fuel glucose from protein so protein can act as a fuel in addition to replacing
your protein in your body so it's not just fat and glucose you can get energy
from protein and this is why when you consume protein when you have low blood
sugar you actually start feeling better now if you were to consume a
carbohydrate when you had hypoglycemia you would feel better for maybe a minute
or two but then the insulin is gonna kick it back down here now what's unique
about consuming protein is that yes you are gonna stimulate some insulin
especially if you're consuming a lot of protein but you're also going to
stimulate at the same time glucagon glucagon is the opposing
hormone to insulin it's made by the pancreas as well and glucagon will raise
the blood sugar and insulin will lower it so it'll create a nice leveling
effect right here when you consume protein so protein is a glucogenic
precursor so it's actually a building block that can be turned into glucose if
your body needs to do that now this video is not just to have people start
consuming a lot of protein I recommend doing a moderate amount of protein it's
just to help you understand why you're gonna feel better if you consume protein
if you have hypoglycemia the ultimate solution for hypoglycemia is to get on a
healthy ketogenic diet do the whole program and intermittent fasting because
that way you will correct this large amount of insulin that is really behind
this problem the first place and that's coming from insulin resistance and once
this is corrected you won't have the highs and lows anymore so the need to
fix anything related to hypoglycemia is not there anymore so your blood Sugar's
may even come down to 70 or even 60 but you don't get those symptoms anymore you
feel very very stable so if you have hypoglycemia I put several videos on
this page so you can get more data thanks for watching

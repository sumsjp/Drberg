this video is about ticks i had another question why don't chickens that eat ticks
get lyme disease okay because it's not really reported it's if you do a search on
this i don't think there's been even one case where a chicken actually got lyme disease and
plus the fact that chickens are known to eat ticks if you let them free range around your
your farm or your house and since i'm living on a farm right now i have about 20 chickens and so
hopefully they're cleaning up all the ticks around our area now when i did some research
on this topic i found one experiment that related to this topic and basically exposed
the chicken to a tick that was carrying lime and the chicken's immune response was strong enough
to defend against this bacteria now the other thing you need to know is that not all ticks
carry the lyme disease all right it could be less than one percent up to 50 so just because you get
bit by a tick does not mean that you're going to get lyme disease and this percentage less than 1
to 50 depends on the location of where you are the other point about ticks is they have to be
attached to your body between 36 to 48 hours or longer before the lyme bacteria can be transmitted
so if it's less than 36 hours chances are that you don't have to worry about it also it takes three
to five days for that tick to fill up blood that's an adult tick the younger tick it could be between
two to three days and so if it hasn't filled up with blood good chance that uh you're not going
to be infected now getting back to this chicken question the first thing is chickens don't have
teeth so if they're free-ranging they're going to eat an insect or a bug or a worm and it's going
to go down their esophagus and it's going to end up in something called the crop and
the crop is kind of a temporary storage place which has friendly bacteria it has lactic acid
so it starts the digestive process then it goes to this thing called a true stomach and
that's where you have this very strong acid very similar to a human stomach where the ph is between
one and three okay actually 1.3 to 3.5 that acid alone is going to start to destroy
the tick or the insect okay plus it's going to activate a very powerful enzyme called
pepsin which is going to start to dissolve this protein shell around this tick and so it's very
unlikely that that tick's going to survive the stomach then after that it ends up in something
called the gizzard which is another stomach area where you have all these muscles and you
also have grit which is like sand oyster shells or little rocks that are going to act as teeth
to start grinding down the food even further and so that tick really has no chance of surviving uh
these stages of a chicken's digestion so if you're eating chicken and thinking you're gonna get lime
it's not gonna happen hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

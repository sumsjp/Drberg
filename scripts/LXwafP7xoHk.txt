so sometimes going on a fast has the potential to lower a thyroid hormone
called t3 and that's the active form of the thyroid hormone t4 is the inactive
version so I'll explain why that is we have the pituitary up here that
communicates of the thyroid through this hormone called thyroid stimulating
hormone and one of the main ways that hypothyroidism is diagnosed is by
looking at this hormone right here but when you fast for the ketogenic diet and
do it healthily you're not going to see a change in this hormone right here so
you are not going to have a true hypothyroid condition or problem then
the thyroid releases t4 which is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone to
become activated it has to work through the liver into the kidney but it
converts from t4 to t3 and T is the active form of the thyroid hormone but
there's something else over here called reverse t3 and the difference between t3
and reverse t3 is that t3 is active in Reverse t3 is an inactive version now
I'm not going to get into the technical part of this but I just simply want to
tell you that what determines the rate and ratio of this conversion to t3 or
reverse t3 is the metabolic need because this has to do with preserving energy
when you do a fast you may see a slight decrease in t3 and many times it'll
still be within the normal range but you're going to see an increase in the
reverse t3 your body is simply becoming more efficient with its fuel so the need
for the active thyroid hormone is going to be a little bit less the body will
then put some of that hormone into a little bit of a reserve until you need
it and it'll be released once you are refeeding and you eat again there's
several situations where you'll see higher amounts of reverse t3 when you're
doing fasting or when you're recovering from a stroke or
injury or overtraining when you're exercising or when you're recovering
from an illness or surgery or when you just have lost a good amount of weight
reverse t3 will go up but one thing I wanna show you is t4 usually represents
90% of all the thyroid hormones t3 will represent about 9% of all the thyroid
hormones and reverse t3 usually represents about 0.9% there is a very
small amount at four months it's like point one that is designated for
something else because fasting slows the conversion from t4 to t3 so it just
dumps out over here it's not a disease state
you're still gonna feel fine you're still gonna lose weight you're not gonna
have any of the symptoms but I think it's important for you know what's
happening sometimes to certain people when they do a fast as it relates to the
thyroid thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering on keto absolutely not Karen and

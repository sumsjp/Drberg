hi guys dr. Berg here listen a lot of times people ask me this question does
eating stimulate your metabolism the answer is absolutely not okay
eating does not stimulate metabolism it will not help you to lose weight it's so
funny sometimes when people say you're you're not losing weight because you're
not eating enough that's not true let me explain every time you eat any
food you're gonna trigger insulin to some
degree and that's part of the mechanism that one of the purpose of insulin is to
drive fuel into the cell so as soon as the food comes down on your stomach hits
those gastral hormones the insulin is going to increase and that is why you
don't want to do six meals or five meals a day that's why you don't want to eat
between meals that's why I don't want to snack between meals that's why you don't
want to graze that night because you're jacking up the insulin your what's gonna
happen the insulin goes up now what's gonna happen it's gonna force the blood
sugars to go down okay so when the sugars go down you're it's low sugar now
guess what you're gonna crave sweet guess what your going to be doing you're
gonna be more hungry so people are confusing that with metabolism but
really it's a low blood sugar situation so your body is gonna start going after
more food more carbs to satisfy the low blood sugar situation when you have low
blood sugars people don't think clearly sometimes they get moody irritable they
feel better when they eat but it's a trap because as soon as you eat boom
all of a sudden drops now you want more especially if you eat the wrong food
alright so I just wanted to bring this point up and give you some clarity on
the truth about eating I recommend three meals a day if you can do two meals that
would be best with no snacks in between thanks for watching

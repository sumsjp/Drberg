hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about the real cause of prostate
enlargement there is a lot of false information floating around out there that states that this
condition is coming from too much DHT which is a very powerful form of testosterone now if that was
true then why is it that this hormone is given to men with enlarged prostates to shrink it it's used
as a therapy so that can't be the real cause in fact as you age especially when you hit 50 this
hormone and this hormone decreases so how could it be that all of a sudden at 50-year prostate
starts enlarging because the true cause of a prostate enlargement is the combination
of ratio of low testosterone in high estrogen because in a male body what does increase when
they when they get into the 40s and 50s and 60s is estrogen that's really what's causing
an enlarged prostate one of the big causes of increased estrogen is not only the hormones in
the food supply but it's also drinking alcohol so alcohol is notorious for increasing estrogen
in the body giving male about his breast tissue you lose your hair on the the calves your voice
starts going high here but the prostate starts enlarging okay so the couple of things you can
do to undo this and reverse this number one you can not drink alcohol number one okay that's a
good idea number two you can start consuming more cruciferous vegetables especially other
vegetables like beets would be good beet tops would be good if you mix it with kale put it
in a blender with maybe a little bit of a cup of frozen berries and blend it with water that
would be very good but the other two herbs that I always recommend you can pretty much get them
anywhere is nettle root and saw palmetto nettle root is awesome for helping lower estrogen and
increasing testosterone and it's also good for inflammation anywhere in the body it works like
that and then also adding this one as well it's a great combination to help help you so go ahead

so at the first sign of a stroke what should someone do let's say you're with a friend or
a family member and you notice a potential sign of a stroke what should you do first let's talk
about what are the signs of a stroke you have numbness in one side of your body it could be
the face it could be even an arm or a leg confusion loss of facial function loss of arm
function on one side loss of leg function slurred speech trouble walking there's a real easy way to
remember some key factors and it's stands for fast so the face okay so if you have the person next to
you that you suspect they just had a stroke have them smile okay and if one side of their face
droops that could be an indicator because you lose facial function on one side the next factor is the
arm have them raise both of their arms and if one side just drops down that could be an indication
of a stroke the next point is have them speak you ask them to repeat a phrase a few times
and see if they can do it if they start slurring that can be a sign of a stroke now realize there's
a very short window to get this person to the hospital so they can actually give them
some type of anti-clotting medication to open up the clot into the brain so the brain can get
oxygen it's like a three to four hour window so you want to probably call
now just as 911 as knowing what to do if someone actually is having a stroke it's what to do to
prevent a stroke the most important thing is getting your diet corrected so your insulin
is normalized so you don't have high insulin because then you develop insulin resistance
and when you have that you have a lot of blood sugar issues and you can form a clot
just with that condition right up the bat so you want to do a low carb healthy diet
also you want to do a diet rich in potassium a lot of leafy greens would be very important
potassium helps support the vascular system and it can also inhibit clotting vitamin e
specifically the tocopherols are probably one of the best antioxidants to support the brain
and free radical damage because what's unique about the brain is that there's a tremendous
amount of oxygen consumption so you have a lot of free radicals and oxidants going on
so you need a good antioxidant vitamin e the tocopherol version is the best number
four ketones so if you're on a ketogenic diet if you're doing mct oil if you take exogenous ketones
all support the brain the brain loves ketones better than glucose and ketones are kind of the
opposite fuel to glucose glucose tends to create more clots ketones can inhibit clots also fasting
intermittent fasting is very very beneficial to the brain and also causing your body to
recycle old damaged protein and so one of the most important things to support both your
cardiovascular system the inside of the lining of your arteries and the brain is intermittent
fasting all sorts of magical things happen then we have dha which is omega-3 fatty acids
omega-3 fatty acids not only thin the blood as does vitamin e but it also can help repair
brain damage and protect the brain against clotting garlic is a good blood thinner
then we have exercise which is going to support more oxygen to the brain cells one last therapy
which i have done and i love is is the hyperbaric oxygen therapy you should look into it if you
haven't heard about it and it can create some serious improvement if you actually had a stroke
and you're trying to force oxygen deep into the brain to repair it hey before you go real quick

i have a question for you what ruins
your metabolism more
is it dieting
or
stress
today we're going to find out now this
topic is interesting especially if you
have a problem losing weight or you get
stuck or you have a plateau
the question is what do you focus on
what do you do so you're not spitting
your wheels and you can get some major
results there are various factors
involved we have
current dieting and past dieting you
have
your stress level you have your sleep
you have your age right which you can't
really do anything about
you have what you eat carbohydrates for
example proteins fats
you might have this idea that maybe you
need to eat smaller meals frequent meals
to stimulate your metabolism then you
have exercise do you exercise more or
maybe you start eating
healthier what do you do and what has
the
biggest impact on your metabolism well i
have some interesting news for you and
you might want to be sitting down for
this okay
your metabolism is not ruined
your metabolism is not
damaged or destroyed
these things right here do not
ruin your metabolism
they actually make your metabolism more
efficient in fact
if you are overweight you should get a
t-shirt i'm not overweight i'm just more
efficient it sounds a lot better
let me explain what i mean you have some
people that can burn fat very easily
and without much effort really you need
other people that boy they
they have to do extreme things to be
able to burn fat and what's really
happening at the cellular level is that
their fat cells are very very efficient
at um releasing energy fat cells do not
like to waste energy so what is the
solution well to make your body waste
more fat
and as a little side note what's
interesting about the ketogenic diet is
that
you're wasting a lot of fat not only are
you primarily burning fat you're
peeing out
excessive
ketones and you're even breathing out
your fat that's why you can test ketones
through
your breath and your urine
so what is being efficient well your
energy system your fat cells and this is
just a survival
mechanism really what controls this
you guessed it insulin okay the pancreas
makes insulin
insulin's job is to store
energy store calories
it's a fat storing hormone when it's
high when the insulin is low
the body then
can burn fat okay so if the insulin is
high you can't burn fat
only when it's low
so the idea is to keep insulin very low
we've got the pancreas that makes
insulin
a little cell called the beta cell here
and what happens over time is when the
insulin is too high
repetitively
then your body starts rejecting it and
it starts to become
more efficient by causing a
resistance to that receptor
the problem is we don't get this return
communication back to the pancreas so we
don't get the message back to the
pancreas that there's a problem there's
a blockage and so the pancreas just goes
okay well i'm just going to produce more
so the pancreas is being ignored so it
just keeps communicating more and more
and more
and we have a situation where we have
both insulin resistance
and too much
insulin okay and
with this message being so high your
body is just like not going to burn fat
and when it holds fat it's being very
very conservative and very efficient so
really the problem is an alteration in
the endocrine
system okay now
before i get into these
items here i just need to explain
something okay this is interesting
let's just talk about diabetes for a
second we have diabetes we have
pre-diabetes and then before that you
have insulin resistance so in order to
get pre-diabetes okay you have to first
have insulin resistance
and with insulin resistance we have this
this compensation going on because
think about it the messages aren't
getting through
so then the body has to make more
insulin to make up for the resistance so
that's to compensate okay
so with pre-diabetes we're getting less
compensation
so now this
compensation mechanism is failing to a
certain degree
so now if we have less insulin being
pumped out okay we have less control
of blood sugars so now the blood sugars
have no choice but they're starting to
go up because one of the functions of
insulin is to take the sugar out of the
blood and turn it into fat right so what
happens is we don't have as much of that
and so now we're getting higher sugars
okay so they're going to diagnose you as
a pre-diabetic and then over time you
become a diabetic now we have even less
compensation we have even less insulin
there so we have higher and higher
levels of blood sugar okay
so that's really what happens with
diabetes now normally when you get
insulin resistance you don't have the
symptom of high blood sugar right your
blood sugars are normal regardless of
how much sugar you eat why
because insulin is working like crazy to
remove that
sugar and unfortunately the doctors are
only focused on the blood sugars and not
the insulin levels you don't go to a
doctor and get your insulin level tested
because if you did it'd be off the
charts you see that test if done right
here
could make you aware of where you are so
you never go into these two things right
here
but with insulin resistance you don't
have any symptoms of high blood sugar
okay
you do have other symptoms
obesity why because of the relationship
between insulin and your fat right you
also have
high cholesterol hydroglycerides you
might have
low hdl and high ldl and you might have
high blood pressure and there's a whole
series of other symptoms you might have
now when things get worse okay and let's
say you're in this mode you might get
really thirsty you might have frequent
urination you might get really tired
after you eat
you can have more of a fatty liver now
the way they diagnose this
is they use an a1c what is an a1c test
it basically measures how much sugar
that is stuck to
your blood cells you know the protein in
your blood okay
so that's really what it what it tells
us and it kind of gives you a
measurement of how much sugar is in your
bloodstream okay because if you look up
obesity diabetes this is what they're
going to say they're going to say yes
what causes this problem is is
definitely related to lifestyle and
genetics but it's still unclear what is
the actual causative factor right i mean
now to me i'm like are these people just
completely ignorant
or
are they
trying to
cover something up or what it just
doesn't make sense because basically a
test to tell us how much sugar is in
your bloodstream so obviously this
relates to diet right
or other things that can affect the
sugar in the blood i mean it's just
bizarre to me if we look at what they
say about this relationship between
cause and effect they will tell you that
there are risk factors involved okay and
that's you know they might say like a
sleep stress carbohydrates things like
that but they won't come out and say the
actual causative factor okay
so that's interesting now
let's
just talk about these
factors that can ruin your metabolism or
shall i say make your metabolism
efficient
well we have poor sleep right we have
stress level we have dieting we have
frequent meals inactivity all these
different things here let's start with
sleep
so if you're not sleeping
you'll notice that you will be hungry
the next day right your appetite will go
up you will want to snack now
there's a couple reasons why one is
there's some there's alteration hormones
you might be tired and you're trying to
eat to get energy
there's also a spike in cortisol there's
also a spike in insulin
and all these hormones can not just make
you fat but can make you hungry all the
time as well so they found in one study
that just one night of poor sleep
can
increase the problem of insulin
resistance okay to a significant degree
and the risk factors of becoming a
diabetic
if you're sleeping five hours or less
is by 3x okay you're 3x more likely to
get diabetes if your sleep is less than
five hours okay so that's
that's significant
all right let's talk about stress what
does stress do
well you have the stress hormone called
cortisol another name for that is
glucocorticoids okay
so stress
increases
not just glucocorticoids but also
adrenaline and both of these
will increase insulin resistance as well
as creating a redistribution of your fat
more in the belly
versus another place
so
stress
makes you fat in the midsection and less
fat in other places
it also increases hunger if you're
trying to lose weight and you have this
appetite and you're always hungry
good luck
and of course lack of sleep
stress spike insulin so this is at the
heart of the problem and i'm just
showing you the relationship between
what's what could be triggering these
two things now if you notice i didn't
even mention carbohydrates yet okay but
carbs definitely will increase your
insulin but stress will do it and also a
lack of sleep will do it all right now
what about this
dieting okay these repetitive cycles of
trying to lose weight
and then going off your program and
gaining it back and then trying to lose
weight and going back in the program so
many people
go on a diet to lose weight and i don't
know for some reason they might think
that that's going to be then maintained
once they lose the weight but
i would highly suggest you search out
something that is more of a
long-term lifestyle
change rather than some diet you go on
because the more times you're doing this
dieting on and off on off on off boy
you're training your fat cells to be
very very conservative you're training
your insulin to be very efficient as
well you're training your endocrine
system to really go at a snail's pace as
far as releasing energy but of course a
lot of this depends
on what this diet is
is it a low calorie high carb diet is it
this or where is it that's
that's a big factor
let's talk about frequent meals um there
are some some diets out there that that
will focus on
have smaller portions okay
and have frequent snacks to prevent
hunger so that way you won't over eat
because they're thinking the calories
are causing the weight gain right
so this frequent meal thing
wow this
right here um
not only do carbs increase insulin but
it's the eating that also increases
insulin so what you're really doing
is you're spiking insulin not
repetitively now you might not be
spiking it
at a very very large
amount
but it's a repetitive chronic
stimulation of insulin
that will just keep you hungry all the
time and keep you from ever being able
to tap into your fat
i mean this right here is just going to
train your system to become so efficient
at holding energy right and not burning
fat then we have inactivity okay not
exercising
so of course you're burning less
calories right
but
it's been found that exercise only is
responsible for about 15 of your weight
loss and so that's not the majority
that's just a small portion
is exercise important absolutely because
not only can it help you burn some
calories but that's a minor thing it can
greatly help you with insulin resistance
okay we'll get to that in a minute
i already mentioned the carbs carbs are
the biggest thing that will increase
insulin of course in sugar and of course
junk food right that has chemicals like
msg
refined carbohydrates can all increase
insulin and keep you
thoroughly hungry all the time causing
you to have a need for more of this all
right now let's just
finally answer the question
what's worse for your metabolism stress
or
dieting or let's just say pass dieting
okay
well
it's going to be stressed let me explain
being in practice for about three
decades
i always would ask a person when did you
start developing
a slow metabolism when did you start to
find out that
man it's becoming more difficult to lose
weight
it was nearly always after a stress
event
okay
always
so it could be a loss of a loved one
loss of a job
and it could have started after a
pregnancy which is a major stress
or it could have happened after some
sustained stress a chronic stress
situation going through a divorce
going through relationship problems
dealing with kids
dealing with money dealing with some
other health problem and i'd really like
you to comment down below just to tell
me
if your weight situation or
your weight becoming more stubborn
occurred after a stress event and what
that stress event
was
all right so stress is really number one
now of course
i'm not talking about current stress i'm
talking about path stress but current
stress could also be a huge huge factor
that could be something that you're not
really focused on as much number two
past dieting this is another one
you take someone who
has been
told that they're overweight as a small
child but maybe by the parents too and
they they start you on a diet you know
when you're a kid you know or you start
dieting in your teenage years
i found that really slows down your
metabolism especially the type of
dieting that they're doing they're not
trying to get the person healthy they're
just putting them on a diet and usually
a physician
supervised diet and hopefully it's not
some drug that they're giving this child
but the point is that
past dieting really trains your uh
system to become so efficient that now
you're stuck with the situation
that you need to
bend the physical universe
to make things go right and go way
beyond what an average person will have
to do
frequent eating that's number three
that's really that's huge
frequent eating does not stimulate your
metabolism it stimulates insulin which
then will slow down your metabolism to a
snail's pace in fact
if we just
you know differentiate between number
three number four carbs and frequent
eating i'm gonna say that it's frequent
eating that's worse than even the carbs
okay because
and i'm not telling you to do this but
if you had carbs and you you did
intermittent fasting you'd probably lose
more weight than if you just
ate healthy foods and
had frequent meals okay i mean it'd be a
good experiment to do
so that's my theory i could be wrong but
you know these are close but i think
it's the frequent eating that's worse so
then of course we have going on a
low-carb diet and
eating healthier quality foods and of
course getting off the junk food all
right number five is asleep okay so
that's important
but not as important as some of these
other things now of course
if you handle
your stress which you need to figure
that out
then that's going to help your sleep all
right number six is inactivity
or
exercising so if you're trying to think
of what to do first second third or
fourth um it wouldn't necessarily be
exercised at the very first thing why
because it only contributes to 15
however that being said
if you start exercising you're gonna
immediately help reduce insulin but what
i'm trying to do is just give you some
relative importances right what's more
important than something else and i
think
this will help you
so what do you do number one do whatever
you can do to reduce stress now i have
many many videos on this and i'm going
to put some down below okay but this has
to come down
and then you're going to sleep better
and just right there that's going to
help you greatly number two
intermittent fasting that is a must and
what's really cool about doing
intermittent fasting and of course at
the same time low carb but if you feel
like you can't do both if you start with
intermittent fasting you'll get further
okay but check this out when you do
fasting
and get on a low carb diet your mood
automatically increases so in other
words you can take someone from
depression or anxiety and bring them up
okay and guess what that's going to do
to your stress
it's going to reduce your stress because
your mood is better your outlook your
viewpoint is better
you take two people that experience the
same stressful event and one person just
has a different way of looking at it
because their mood is higher versus
someone else
you're going to have much less impact on
your body
if you just are in a better state of
mind and then of course number three add
the exercise in there that's going to
help you with your insulin resistance
but what we're trying to do ultimately
is fix
this efficiency problem and get your
body to waste more
energy
so on that note since stress is number
one

stress right here

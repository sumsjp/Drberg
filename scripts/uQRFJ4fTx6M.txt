you know i've done so many videos on how to lose weight i haven't done a video
on how to gain weight gain actual fat and i think it's good sometimes reverse the flow because if
you really know how to gain weight which a lot of people do then you can actually reverse this plan
and actually help yourself lose weight now i stumbled on this uh this diet that just
actually made me laugh it's called the nibbling diet okay it was an actual diet
the nibbling diet where you're consuming 17 snacks per day this was written in 1978 and basically not
only do you have three meals and two snacks but you have additional snacks in between the snacks
so this is actually even worse than the six meals per day plan that some people are doing and it's
also similar to the snack all day diet i'm not kidding there's an actual diet called the snack
all day diet where you're doing six snacks okay you're roughly doing about 180 calories
per snack your dinner is 300 calories but you can do trades you can trade a snack for another snack
or you can trade two snacks for a dinner because we all know that this whole calorie counting thing
absolutely doesn't work we've tried it a million times it doesn't work it's outdated but some
people keep trying over and over and over again so let me get back to the nibbling diet the whole
strategy of this nibbling diet where you're doing 17 snacks a day is this it makes you feel like
you are in control because you're you're actually eating anytime you want so you're in control right
well actually it's just the opposite you're completely out of control what's out of control
is your hormones your hormones are so far out of whack that you are actually in the back seat and
your hormones are driving the car and so this is just a disaster waiting to happen because
every time you snack i don't care what you snack on you're going to just jack up insulin it's going
to come down up and down up and down and guess what insulin is the hormone that converts your
food into fat insulin is a hormone that makes you hungry and insulin is triggered by eating
as well as eating carbs as well as eating anything and so every time you eat you're just jacking
this thing up all day long 17 times right it's a perfect plan to put on fat let's say for example
you're auditioning for a movie and you have to gain some quick fat this would be the perfect diet
to go on another rationale in this book is that animals eat all day long and they don't get fat i
guess he's talking about a cow right well first of all cows are fat and they eat grass so maybe you
should start eating grass you can graze it all day long and maybe that'll help you but most animals
don't graze all day long they usually go for a period of time without eating so they're really
doing a lot of fasting a lot of intermittent fasting and of course the cow is constantly
regurgitating and and this grass is going through these four stomachs and it's fermenting completely
different digestive system than humans now the other rationale that they use in this book is that
you want to eat to prevent hunger okay because if you're hungry you might overeat so if you're
snacking just a small amount then you're going to be safe because you're not going to overeat
but the problem is you're going to jack up insulin so everything you're eating is being converted
into fat so that is not a good uh strategy and then they talk about these snacks are going to
prevent a a low blood sugar situation so thereby cutting down on your hunger i guarantee this
the more snacking you do the more hungry you're going to be in fact snacking and binging is going
to completely prevent your ability to tap into fat okay so you only have a little bit of sugar supply
it's going to be tapped out and then you're going to be hungry again you're gonna put yourself
in a serious situation where you're gonna be fat and hungry and tired and then pre-diabetic
and then diabetic so now that you know how to get fat let's reverse this and implement
the opposite strategy which is intermittent fasting don't snack eat infrequently drop
insulin now your body can tap into fat an average person has almost an unlimited amount of fat to
use as fuel versus the amount of stored sugar that you would use it's very very small so you want to
be able to tap into almost an unlimited amount of fuel and that way you're burning fat 24 7 you have
no hunger your appetite is gone so you can lose weight much easier because you're not gonna have
the appetite you're not gonna be hungry if you're new to my channel i put the exact plan down below
so just follow it and i promise you it will work hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of

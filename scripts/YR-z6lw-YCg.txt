all right i'm back to answer another question someone wanted to know why am i hungry in the
morning while i'm on keto and doing intermittent fasting i have done another video on this but
sometimes it's hard to find so i'm just going to create a video on this topic and just cover all
the different pieces of this puzzle there's really three reasons why you are hungry in the morning if
you're doing keto and intermittent fasting the first one involves a hormone called cortisol
so about eight o'clock in the morning and this could actually happen at six o'clock in the
morning up to ten so during that period of time what happens you have a spike in cortisol cortisol
or another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids because it affects glucose one of the functions
of cortisol which is made by your adrenals is to release glucose from your stored sugar glycogen
now in the morning if it's going to release sugar from your liver you're going to get a little spike
of sugar and then your insulin is going to come in and bring your sugar down so when it comes down
you're going to be hungry now i want to just differentiate between being hungry and having
hypoglycemia if you're hungry and you still feel fine you still are strong you're not moody you're
not dizzy then just ignore this symptom and just push through it because it's only going to last
maybe 10 minutes 15 minutes and it's going to go away now the correct indication of when you should
start eating after fasting is when you're truly hungry and you're feeling weak or irritable
and dizzy i mean you should definitely eat you don't want to push through that
but if it's some slight stomach hunger or grumbling in your stomach just ignore that
push through that that's usually temporary and usually this hunger in the morning usually occurs
in the very beginning stages of doing ketosis and intermittent fasting all right number two and this
is very common the reason why you're hungry in the morning is what you ate the day before
especially if it's the night before now two things either you ate too many carbs the night before
or you had some snacks either right before bed or sometime in the middle of the day and
it could have been some healthy snacks but you're again you're spiking insulin because you ain't
so both of those actions will spike insulin to some degree and then create a situation where
your blood sugars come down and you're mainly going to feel it the next day
either in cravings for carbs or being hungry and this definitely can occur when you consume
wine the night before so just realize that it's not that it's not working
you just have to push through this and be more consistent today so tomorrow the cravings go away
the biggest indication to know that you're doing this correctly is that you have no more hunger and
you're not craving anything so that's like a very important thing all right let's go to number three
this is simply you haven't done the program long enough sometimes it takes three days to really
get into ketosis sometimes it's five and for some people it could be several weeks before you really
truly adapt and get into ketosis and your body is very efficient at burning fat a
couple things you can do to make this transition more smooth is to increase more fat at the meal
increase apple cider vinegar in water before the meal one tablespoon and water before the each meal
and to increase your veggies so you get more potassium and magnesium and fiber all three
of those things will help stabilize your blood sugars so your hunger goes away but the most
important thing you need to know is that you don't want to eat unless you're hungry so if you're not
hungry in the morning even though it might be a habit to eat skip it and go as long as you can
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

now i know a lot of people on the ketogenic diet drink coffee and i drink coffee but
the question is is it healthy is it unhealthy can coffee actually lower your risk of disease
well actually it can i'm going to list a few studies here down below but i want to quote
a few the first study involved 41 000 men and 86000 women and these were regular coffee drinkers
and they found no association with an increased mortality rate in men and women second study
demonstrated that coffee consumption did lower your risk of type 2 diabetes next one
was a meta-analysis this is a summary of a lot of different studies that's what they found coffee
consumption may decrease the risk of liver breast kidney and even colorectal cancer interesting next
study which all these are going to be listed below showed that coffee consumption is not associated
with risk of getting a stroke in fact they found a moderate decreased risk of getting a stroke
not significant but moderate and then there was a four-year study involving 386 000 coffee drinkers
there was no evidence of any risk of getting arrhythmias that being said i will say if you're
a heavy coffee drinker and you're drinking more than five or more there was a few studies that
showed an increased risk of coronary heart disease as well as an increased risk of arrhythmias but if
you're drinking a moderate amount of coffee or a small amount of coffee like myself i do one cup
every day it's not that large it's strong but it's like eight ounces of strong coffee once a day in
the morning that's all i do but apparently coffee has polyphenols those are antioxidants those
are anti-inflammatory so a small or a moderate amount of coffee i would highly recommend organic
can be beneficial to your health hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

hey guys I'm going to answer a question why do I have insulin resistance but normal a 1c
I had a client ask me this so I'm just going to do a video on it first of all what is insulin
resistance it's a pre-diabetic State okay it's something that comes before diabetes it's a
situation where you're having higher amounts of insulin because insulin is not working okay so
then the body makes more so that's what that is and then a1c is a test to diagnose diabetes and
a1c is an average test an average of three months of your blood Sugar's so it's more reliable than
just one blood blood sugar test so a1c should be like in the like high fours fives low fives
but when it gets into higher 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and then you have a serious blood sugar you're already
diabetic so that's how they diagnose it but check this out you first get insulin resistance okay
then it converts into a type-2 diabetes which is the first stage where your actual officially at
problems your blood sugar now here's the thing it takes 10 years for this to develop in some cases
sometimes it's a lot shorter but in a lot of cases it's 10 years so you may test it in the transition
phase where it's subclinical it doesn't show up on your blood Sugar's yet so of course it's
not going to show up and they won't see yet it hasn't affected your blood sugar is necessarily
the insulin is high but it hasn't done anything with the blood Sugar's yet okay so one test that
you could do for insulin resistance and I'll do a specific video and this is a fasting insulin
test not a fasting glucose test and that way you can pick this up a lot better but what happens
you've got instant resistance type 2 and even type 2 can turn it into a type 1 where there's
no more insulin however there are other causes of type 1 there is also a genetic type it's
also autoimmune triggered by stress okay but if you take a type 2 over a period of time if you
notice a lot of type twos they started metformin and then all of a sudden they need more insulin
and more influence and more insulin why because they're their selves that produce insulin are
wearing out over time and then to the point where often they don't produce any insulin and they
would be officially categories as a type one type one just doesn't produce any more insulin okay
the cells are exhausted okay so this is the kind of a cycle of worsening of blood sugar so I hope
that answered this question and put your comments below thanks for watching hey guys thank you so

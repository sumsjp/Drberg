have you ever tasted synthetic meat is this the wave of the future does it really help the
environment is there any other solution to factory farms you know synthetic meat has been promoted
as plant-based clean meat uh to get away from all that unhealthy processed meat but the question is
is it really plant-based and is it clean and less processed i mean it has less saturated fat
but let's take a look at what actually is in synthetic meat all right first ingredient
autolyzed yeast okay well that's not a plant it's a flavor enhancer then we have bleached wheat
flour now that does come from a grain which is a seed of a plant but it's not the actual green
part of the plant and of course bleached flour has chemicals that destroyed vitamin e which is
key for the heart then you have food dyes which is not plant-based it's pretty toxic by the way
artificial flavorings canola oil well that's the oil of the seed but it's not really the plant
but i guess it's plant-based but it's highly unstable and when you heat it it gives off a
lot of free radicals and it's inflammatory then you have something called carrageenan
it will help the texture it makes things more thick but it creates a lot of digestive issues
next one is copper sulphite which actually acts as a pesticide it can curb any type of microbial
growth corn oil of course corn is a plant so i guess that would be plant-based but it's gmo
it has residues of glyphosate and it definitely can create a lot of oxidative stress in free
radical damage corn syrup solids dextrose which is a synthetic sugar hydrolyzed vegetable protein
and the vegetables they're talking about again is soy corn wheat okay modified food starch that's
msg it's going to make it taste a lot better and then you have something called mycoprotein what
is mycoprotein is this from mushrooms no it's from a fungus that's right they take these little
threads of a fungus and they put it in this huge vat of glucose probably made from gmo corn
and every five hours this fungus grows and then they add ammonia to it to then
spike the growth of amino acids and then they extract that and i'm sure it's very very pure
and clean in the extraction process now is it sustainable can we continue to live off this and
i'm going to put the disclaimer live healthily one thing i don't think they spend enough time
when they did the research on this is to check the health of the individual who consumes this
one day i was at whole foods and i was looking through the deli there and they had something
that looked like chicken wings i thought they were chicken wings they were shaped like chicken wings
and so i bought some and i started eating them and i'm like is this must be chicken nuggets right
well it was synthetic chicken nuggets and oh my goodness did i have the worst digestive problem i
was starting to bloat i felt disgusted so comment down below if you've ever consumed synthetic meat
and if by consuming it it made you feel better or gave you any additional health benefits because
if something is going to be sustainable it has to improve your health
or else it's going to take away from your health and it's definitely not going to be
sustainable hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you

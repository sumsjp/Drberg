today we're going to talk about the relationship between fasting during
Ramadan and its immune effects Ramadan lasts between 29 and 30 days and you're
required not to drink or eat anything just before sunrise to just after sunset
this is a dry fast and what I mean by a dry fast is you're not drinking any
water now before we get into the benefits I do want to point out this one
very very important point if you look at some of the studies done on Ramadan
you're gonna see some mixed reviews and I think the reason for that because what
you eat before and after you fast is going to make or break your success if
you are eating a lot of junk food or refined carbohydrates that is going to
greatly inhibit these amazing effects that you could achieve if you added keto
friendly foods low carb during the meals I mean think about it ketones in
general are antimicrobial when you do fasting you actually decrease with cold
cytokines there are different types of cytokines and cytokines are chemical
messages that communicate between your immune cells there are certain cytokines
that cause inflammation and those are the ones that we're talking about so
it'll decrease the trigger to inflammation also it will stimulate
something called macrophages a macrophage is a large cell that eats
bacteria and microbes and viruses this is like a professional what's called a
phagocyte which not just like a garbage disposal but it is a deadly killer any
one of the first lines of defense for any type of invasion for microbes the
more you can stimulate macrophages the better the immune system all right next
thing is it will increase the microbiome what is the microbiome that describes
your friendly microbes in your body that help you a great majority of your mewn
system and I'm talking like 70 percent is located in your large intestine and
I'm talking about a microbiome which I did a video on and I'll
that link down below gives you incredible immune support and without it
your risk for infection go straight up and vertical when you do fasting which
is kind of weird because you're actually kind of starving them they live longer
there's certain type of genetic things that get triggered that support your
immune system next thing is resistance to stress when
you fast you increase your capacity to fight off stress as well as DNA damage
to also when you fast you decrease oxidative stress you're gonna have less
free radicals you're also going to get an increase in production of your
antioxidant networks which also can help as well and lastly fasting will increase
autophagy which is your body's ability to recycle old damaged parts as well as
microbes there's a very specific type of autophagy called xenophage which targets
pathogens one huge benefit of fasting is basically the elimination of these
microbes that can stay dormant in your body for many many years
Ramadan has huge powerful effects on the immune system but I think it could be a
lot better if you also add Keto if you're new to my channel I put a link
down below of exactly what you should be eating to enhance your benefits if you

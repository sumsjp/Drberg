so if you have adrenal fatigue and you've been working on the adrenals forever
and it's not resolving it could be something else it could be your liver and that is because
the body has other sources of cortisol in other words your liver can make cortisol some of the
immune cells can activate cortisol your gonads can make cortisol your central nervous system
can make cortisol so the more the liver is damaged the less adrenal hormones you're going to have
available and the symptoms for that could be a low tolerance to stress you can't handle stress
low immune system having more inflammation more fatigue less sleep you have insomnia
now with the liver there's a protein called cortisol binding globulin
and 75% of all your cortisol in your body is locked up with this thing right here another name for
it is called transcortin and so it's like your back up reserve right well the more the liver is
damaged the less you have of this and this leads to a lower amount of adrenal hormones and so when
you have lower amount of adrenal hormones you get more of these symptoms like allergy inflammation
skin issues asthma which then forces you to take a synthetic type of cortisol called prednisone
which then has side effects of a fatty liver which then gives you more of these symptoms which
increases the need for more of this there's some serious side effects from prednisone
increasing glucose in your blood even triggering diabetes fat liver increase
high blood pressure increase belly fat these are the same symptoms is high insulin because
prednisone is a glucocorticoid it actually causes your proteins to turn into glucose as as one of
the side effects and of course the high glucose then causes the blood sugar issues so if you've
been working on your adrenals for a long period of time and it's not being solved realize it could be
the liver and i would switch gears to support the liver now one of the things that you can do
if you're new to my channel is get on something called the healthy keto plan and intermittent
fasting i put a link down below of how to do that but over time going on a low carb diet will
help clean up the liver reduce inflammation and improve liver function so thereby helping restore
the adrenals a lot of people that have been on the ketogenic diet and doing intermittent fasting
over a period of time end up having good strong adrenals with high resistance to stress
less fatigue less inflammation and a better immune system simply because they're improving
the liver hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here
what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about ketosis and kidney stones okay a
lot of you are doing ketosis I'm going to show you what to do to prevent kidney stones because
here's the problem when you are on a ketosis diet you do get rid of calcium in the urine
more than usual right now here's the problem when you're consuming cruciferous vegetables which I'm
always recommending or spinach or iced tea or chocolate which maybe you shouldn't be doing
all that has high amounts of something called oxalates okay the oxalates combined with the
calcium to make stones so that's a situation blue they're not kale is very low in oxalates
compared to spinach spinach is off-the-charts so if you're doing spinach then all we have to
do is not necessarily avoid calcium believe it or not you want to take some some food based calcium
you want to actually get your calcium from food whether it's cheese or something like that because
if you consume dietary food calcium what happens the I high levels of oxalates which are you're
consuming as well will bind in the digestive system instead of going into the blood and
out to the urine through the kidney so in other words if you're not consuming enough calcium I'm
not talking about pills actually calcium in food that's why I do eat cheese on a regular basis if
you're allergic then you're gonna have to find some other source but the point is that that
calcium in the digestion will then protect the kidneys by taking more calcium so that
way it never ends up in the kidney so that's one thing the other mechanism for stones is that your
low end citrate now what does that mean there's a certain thing in the body called citrate and when
you don't have enough of that you can be more at risk for kidney stones so that's why I recommend
the lemon juice and a regular basis so I even take when I do a cow shake I will pour maybe 2
or 3 ounces of lemon juice in that couch it makes them nice little shake or just start putting the
lemon in your water you can do it as just a liquid or the actual lemon but at least one
lemon a day that will also decrease the risk for kidney stones the other thing is making sure you
have enough magnesium well that's going to come from the vegetables but if you're actually doing
a ketosis with not enough vegetables then you need to increase that to get the magnesium you
can also take this as a supplement too but I would not take a calcium magnesium I would take just a
magnesium supplement unless you know you need calcium and there's and I have certain videos
that explain when you need that but typically people have a bit too much they're taking too
much calcium as supplements or not taking it from the food alright so I hope this helped go
ahead and apply it and leave your comments below hey guys thank you so much for watching I really

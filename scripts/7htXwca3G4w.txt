hey we're doing another one in what I call the cheesecake series okay it's
like a series of books only a series of recipes these fat bombs are cheesecake
based and this one is called the chocolate chip nut seed fat bomb Wow
because I am a fan of adjectives wow that's amazing what see hmm no this has
some good salt that yeah uh the recipe doesn't say but I use salted sunflower
seeds to roll the balls in really well you got it can we edit that I know it's
that you're laughing is what was weird look I'm just telling you how to make
the recipe okay oh you're making me cry okay so I have a question I have a
female question hey Karen you're a woman right well I thought of a female question
okay so I think there's a big difference between men and women there's no editing
here no ok so can't wait to hear this part in relationship to diet women
definitely from I watch in my research mm-hmm like variety
Oh in different foods yes men can pretty much eat the same darn thing every
single day of their lives I don't think that's true and men if you
are Italian or you are a foodie I don't think you'd agree and you'll have to
comment below well I'm giving a generalized statement
again making a broad generalization yes about women that's right and you're like
variety and like that's why we're making all these
different keto bombs or you're making because keep it entertaining like I
could probably pretty much do the same keto bomb every single day you eat the
same food every right every single that's right every day
I just wanted to point out that tiny little difference so you think because you eat
the same food every single day that all men absolutely right guys hey if you're
a guy press down below and you'll agree with me right all right well let's
let's at least show how to make it okay

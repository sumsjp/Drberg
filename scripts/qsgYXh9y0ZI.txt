now this might be
a little creepy video but there are
microbes
actually living in your mattress so
that's the topic for today so i'm just
trying to increase your awareness
because a lot of people have no idea
what's going on in their mattresses the
place that they spend one third of their
life
sleeping so let's first talk about dust
mites okay what are dust mites well
there are small
tiny tiny little microorganisms that um
thrive in your mattress
they thrive in your pillow so at any one
time you might have
10 million of them living in your
mattress
and they don't bite you okay they just
live on your dead skin cells and an
average person will shed over a million
pieces of little dead skin particles
every single day and so these dust mites
have plenty to eat the male dust mite
lives for about 10 to 19 days
but a female will live about 70 days and
produce over 100 eggs and it really
depends on the moisture so
if your bathroom is attached to your
bedroom and you take a shower and you
leave the door open and you have all
this moisture in there or it's the
summer time and you leave the window
open it's very very
humid that can really allow these dust
mites to thrive
so it may be a good idea to limit that
and you might even want to get a
dehumidifier but with dust mites you are
the food and the big problem is the
allergies people are sensitive to them
and they'll wake up congested they might
have red eyes they might start sneezing
but don't worry at the end i'm going to
tell you what to do about all this all
right number two bed bugs okay you don't
want to let the bed bugs bite you
because they do bite you the size of a
bed bug is about the size of an apple
seed
and
they can't fly but they can run pretty
quickly on the floor on the ceiling
so they're pretty fast little critters
and in one study they found that uh they
counted how many of these bed bugs were
in a mattress and they found two
thousand so there's quite a few of them
that could be living in your bed and
they bite you while you're sleeping and
they have this little tube that they can
inject into for about three to ten
minutes
and they live on your blood and so if
you wake up
with a little um itchy red bump
it could be a bed bug all right now
let's get to the next topic
fungus and bacteria but i apologize in
advance i'm going to gross you out a
little bit but an average adult sweats
26
gallons
in their bed every single year i mean
that is a crazy amount of sweat coming
out of your body and that breeds an
environment for fungus and bacteria
unfortunately there was a recent lab
test done
on seven-year-old mattresses and they
found 16 million colony units
of bacteria per
inch
okay so there's a lot of microbes living
in your mattress and this could affect
you by waking up with a stuffy nose um
waking up sneezing red itchy eyes
and then number four we have this thing
called pet dander over 50 of pet owners
actually share their bed with their pet
and of course pets bring in all sorts of
things into the bed it's it's a common
source for things like fleas and ticks
so you may want to consider potentially
having a pet-free zone in your bed and
maybe having them sleep on the floor or
in another room all right and number
five chemicals when your body heats up
when you're sleeping in the mattress
there are certain chemicals that get
released they're called volatile organic
compounds you have an increased release
of formaldehyde and many other chemicals
that can be released and not to mention
all the new chemicals that can occur
with a new mattress so what are we going
to do about this well number one regular
washing of your bedding and your sheets
with very hot water
i would also add some baking soda in
there because baking soda will kill
microbes the next thing i would do is i
would try to reduce humidity as much as
you can keep your bathroom shut maybe
keep the windows closed if it's if it's
hot outside or just have a dehumidifier
going on in the room avoid pet exposure
if you have a problem with some of these
issues get a good air purifier because
if there's chemicals that are released
from the bed and you have allergies
that can greatly help you add the baking
soda to the wash which i already
mentioned and number six
vacuum your mattress
on a regular basis because
things accumulate because you want to
keep the microbial population
at a minimum
so i'm sorry i grossed yet on this video
so the next video that i think you
should watch
is on growing certain plants in your
room to increase more oxygen so you can
sleep better i put it up right here
check it out
you

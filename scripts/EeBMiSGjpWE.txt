so I want to chat about something very interesting about the coronavirus
typically the symptoms and there's actually quite a lot of different
symptoms but mainly you get fever you're tired a dry cough shortness of breath
sore throat your lungs start to become inflamed and
there's a series of symptoms but recently there's been an observation
that there's an additional symptom okay and it's a loss of smell the medical
name for loss of smell is anosmia OK you can also get a loss of taste
where everything just tastes like cardboard that has been recently found
to be a common symptom of the coronavirus so the question is why and I have
some ideas the first thing I want to tell you is that there's a certain
enzyme that's involved in your perception of smell and taste and this
is the name of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 6 and this essential enzyme
for taste and smell is zinc dependent ok and now I'm not sure that you know this
but one big symptom of a zinc deficiency is a loss of smell and a loss of taste
you can even go online and order a zinc test which basically you take a little
zinc and you put it in your mouth and if you cannot taste anything your zinc
deficient because usually zinc tastes very metallic so if you actually taste
that metallic taste you have enough zinc if you don't taste it you are deficient
so you can actually get that test and see for yourself but if you do research
on this symptom alone ok a loss to smell it will list a series of causes and I'm
going to go through them and I want to show you how many of them are related
and connected to zinc because I really think the reason for this symptom is a
zinc deficiency for a couple reasons one is that when you go through an infection
especially in your lungs you use up a lot of zinc zinc is not stored that
well so unless you're constantly consuming zinc chances are you're going
to be deficient on top of that if you get this infection you're gonna be even
more deficient and zinc has a huge purpose of protecting you against
microbes and especially viruses it's a really key immune protector for the
immune system so let's take a look at the causes of loss of smell first of all
we have upper respiratory infection we already know that 16 percent of
pneumonia cases are actually caused by a zinc deficiency okay so there's
definitely that relationship nasal polyps next one idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
now say that three times real fast
basically the testicles are shrinking and idiopathic means we don't know why
okay unknown cause well guess what zinc deficiency will cause hypogonadism as
well as low testosterone next one hypothyroidism antibiotics diabetes high
levels of sugar in the blood will deplete zinc FYI Cushing's syndrome this
is a condition where you have high cortisol high cortisol and or stress
will deplete zinc and then we have the next one cadmium poisoning cadmium
cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that will definitely deplete zinc so that's
probably why you have a loss of smell because the cadmium depletes zinc and
then you have this next one which I already told you a zinc deficiency so
loss of smell could be caused by a zinc deficiency
here's next one kallmann syndrome what is this this is a genetic condition
where you have hypogonadism then we have this last one primary ciliary dyskinesia
now what the heck is that and this just means the genetic disorder involving a
function of your sperm well guess what sperm is highly influenced by the amount
of zinc in your body so what can we learn from this information well the
loss of smell potentially could be a zinc deficiency and if you take zinc not
only will you be able to improve the sense of smell but you will also
increase the strength of the immune system so what can someone take away
from this information well just the importance of zinc and how vitally
important it is not just for smell but to protect your immune system to
decrease the duration where someone is going through an infection and the fact
that when someone has an infection they're probably already deficient so if
you haven't seen my video on boosting the immune system check it out I put it
right here

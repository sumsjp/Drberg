let's talk about the three best remedies for
psoriasis if you have psoriasis you definitely need to watch this entire
video i put a tremendous amount of research
into this topic to summarize it to make it
extremely simple and to hopefully help you
so there's some really simple things you can do
that are non-toxic the greek word for psoriasis comes from
sora means itchy and iastis means action or condition so it's an itchy
condition psoriasis is an autoimmune condition
where your body is producing antibodies against itself so
the symptoms of psoriasis are coming from your own immune system
and certain parts of your skin are replaced
every three to five days instead of every 28 to 30 days so we
have this accelerated reproduction of skin cells and that's what creates
the redness and the scaling and the little white
flakes that are on the like the little plaque
so here's what's going on there is a t cell dysfunction
the t cells are part of the immune system that's called the acquired immune
system you're not born with it you develop it over time
and there's a dysfunction going on an imbalance
triggered usually by an altered microbiome either in your gut
or a really really bad sore throat a strep throat
or another infection and there's several different types of t cells the
one that is involved is the t helper cell th17 it's called
and this happens to be your own immune cell that induces
inflammation and autoimmune diseases and also it releases cytokines so it has
an additional inflammatory signal on top of that
now there's other t cells called the t regulatory cells that are involved in
preventing autoimmune diseases in the first place
and those are usually suppressed so we have a suppressed t regulatory
cell and we have an increase in t helper
cells th17 now if you do some research on this
you're going to find some interesting data
on the relationship between the t helper cell th17
and vitamin d vitamin d happens to be something that can suppress th17
and so this is very interesting because vitamin d
is not really a vitamin it's a hormone that acts like cortisol in the body
which happens to be one of the big treatments for psoriasis
prednisone and anti-inflammatory so vitamin d is a natural
prednisone without the side effects the other interesting thing about this
is that psoriasis is worse in the winter why
because the vitamin d is going to be lower also there's higher
incidence of psoriasis the further you live from the equator
and if you have psoriasis you're a greater risk for depression
and one of the big root causes of depression is a vitamin d
so we have vitamin d very very important i would recommend 40 000 iu's
every single day you need to take enough to penetrate
sometimes the damage that's in the colon that's not allowing you to absorb the
vitamin d there's usually an altered microbiome so
you have to take a little bit more now cod liver oil not only does cod live
oil have vitamin d and vitamin a which is also good for the
skin but it also has the omega-3 fatty acids
dha and epa and one of the main symptoms of an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency
is dry scaly red skin also omega-3 is an
anti-inflammatory the last remedy is bile salts
why because bile salts stimulate the vitamin d receptor
bile salts allow vitamin d to work a lot better in the body so if there's any
type of resistance let's say you have some
genetic alteration in your receptor for vitamin d
it's called a polymorphism this will help potentially increase the absorption
also bile salts directly modulate or control
the t helper cell 17 the th17 cell so bile salts are going to help to
regulate this dysfunction as well as stimulate the t regulatory
cells that's the one that puts the fire out
it helps to calm down the inflammation so the type of bile salt i'm going to
recommend for this would be tudka t-u-d-c-a i'm not
recommending a brand just get whatever you can find that has good views
and take three to four per day it'll be used to help you digest the dietary fat
what we want to do is to take an empty stomach so it can actually focus on
helping regulate the immune system and as far as the cod liver oil take
whatever is recommended on the bottle that you buy
and the last two things i'm going to recommend are fasting
very very very important for all autoimmune conditions as well as
no gluten at all in the diet so go ahead and apply this information
and comment down below i want to hear your results

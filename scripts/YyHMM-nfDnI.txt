so I had a question are you becoming a germaphobe now listen I am NOT against
protecting yourself against the coronavirus or any virus at all with a mask or
washing your hand and you need to do that the point I want to make is this
not all germs are harmful or dangerous and I want to make a distinction
friendly microbes are not pathogenic okay so pathogens are those microbes
that cause disease that includes a virus bacteria fungus candida etc you have as
a huge part of your immune system trillions and trillions of friendly
microbes around the surface of your body inside your body in your colon and when
you over sterilize your body it can lower your immune system and make you
more susceptible to having infections these microbes do so much good there's
certain microbes that make acid that makes a pathogen not want to live in
that environment your microbes make vitamins to support your immune system
they also have anti-tumor properties and a lot of people get grossed out when
they realize that they have an entire universe of microbes living through the
body and your environment everywhere you touch there's microbes there's germs all
over the place but what they have to realize is when they start to overly
destroy the microbes on our body as well as the microbes in our food our
resistance to infection goes down because these microbes are symbiotic
they actually help form a barrier to protect us and some interesting studies
where they have germ-free mice they basically have no microbial life living
inside or outside that Mouse they end up with autoimmune diseases allergies
asthma and all sorts of other health problems if you look on the surface of
your skin it's not just a layer of dead cells there are billions of things
living on your skin and I know it's kind of creepy but that's called skin flora
and this flora is very very necessary to protecting you it's a
immune defense when you alter this it's called microbiome you basically throw
the body out of balance and you start getting inflammatory conditions even on
the surface of your skin you can have psoriasis you can have a rosacea you can
even get acne over sterilization of your body leads to a decrease in T cells and
these T cells are formed the adaptive immunity which is really really
important in preventing inflammatory reactions throughout the body
unfortunately the viewpoint that most people have about germs is very very
negative they're not very aware of the benefits of these microbes even with
your food if you consume too much sterilized food and I'm talking about
food that is pasteurized whether it's canned or in a bottle it's heated with
high temperatures or killing off everything including enzymes or even
radiated they actually use radiation on our food nowadays and when you eat these
foods that are so-called sterilized it actually creates an immune reaction and
it can actually weaken our immune system in summary the point about this video is
that you have to realize that you are born with an incredibly complex
sophisticated immune system way more powerful as compared to any type of
military that ever was on this planet your immune system if you maintain it
and you keep it healthy can defend you against just about any attack from any
virus or bacteria on this planet and this is why the strategic advantage of
the virus is that it can invade someone with a compromised immune system but it
can have an extreme disadvantage and a very hard time infecting someone with a
strong immune system so if you want more information about how to boost your
immune system I put it right here

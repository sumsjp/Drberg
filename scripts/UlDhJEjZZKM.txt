all right so today we're going to talk
about leech therapy what is it
is it is it actually something that
people actually do
well yes they do there's a lot of
clinics i know at least in the united
states they have clinics
but leech therapy has been around for a
very long
time and in 2004 the fda approved
medical leeches as a treatment
for plastic and reconstructive surgery
now why what can it do well apparently
it helps
venous congestion so it can speed up
healing in the saliva of leeches there's
over a hundred bioactive substances
with a wide range of effects acting as
an anticoagulant
blood thinner vasodilator anesthetic
antibiotic effect so in a diabetic it
can help
suppress blood clotting diabetics
normally have
thicker blood and with one of the main
bioactive substances
called herodin which is 10 times more
effective than
heparin so what are some of the
conditions that people are using this
therapy
for venous congestion like i said
certain cardiovascular effects to help
reduce
the clotting mechanism systemically
in stroke patients and heart attack
patients
people with arthritis can benefit people
with high blood pressure
people who have hemorrhoids blood clots
and even skin disorders so because i
studied
so many different topics i i saw this
therapy and i was
at first i'm like leech therapy really
so apparently it's a valid therapy and a
lot of people are using it

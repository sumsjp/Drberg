so someone had a question recently related to the ph of saliva and they're very concerned
about their ph being too acid to alkaline and they wanted to know what should it be
well this is the normal ph range of your saliva between 6.2 to 7.6 and anything above
7 goes alkaline anything below 7 is acid 7 being neutral so your saliva could be slightly
acidic could be slightly basic or alkaline so it could be both now if your saliva goes too high
potentially you can start developing tartar if it's too low and you become too acidic
you could start developing dental cavities as well as infections in the gum
and bad breath and there's a whole bunch of other problems that you can develop
well you have to realize that in your mouth you have a lot of bacteria that use dietary sugar to
make acids and that's what really breaks down the tooth now if you're on the ketogenic diet
you could be very very acidic because the definition of keto is just low carb so you
can just do a lot of fat and protein and get into ketosis and end up becoming pretty acidic
now the type of keto that i recommend is healthy keto which my definition is
providing all the nutrients that you need and balancing out
your protein fat with vegetable a lot of it between at least seven cups up to 10 cups per day
now of course that would be more salad i'm not talking about 10 cups of broccoli for example
there's no way you're going to do that maybe you do four cups per day but when you're talking about
salad you have big salads that provides a lot of alkalinity to help balance off these acids so
you have a lot of potassium magnesium and also calcium so that way you provide all the nutrients
to help buffer any type of foods that could create excessive amounts of you know acids now
if someone has candida okay in the mouth they're going to develop excessive amounts of ammonia and
ammonia is very alkaline so that can really throw off your entire ph from this infection right here
and also if someone is under chronic stress they tend to become excessively alkaline which is
interesting but the real problem is when you talk about ph what fluid of the body are you talking
about are you talking about the blood which is slightly alkaline are you talking about the
large intestine which is acid or what about the gallbladder and it's fluid which is alkaline or
the stomach which is extremely acid so it's very important to define what fluid you're talking
about if you're too alkaline a two acid the problem is trying to diagnose someone from having
either an acid saliva or an alkaline saliva is pretty much a waste of time because what's going
on the saliva is really happening systemically even from your urine what's happening in the urine
is happening more internally one of the problems with testing the ph of your blood is as soon as
you inject the person and take the blood out it quickly oxidizes and it alters the ph so
it's very difficult to determine the ph of your blood unless you have some fancy equipment and i
know typically that there's this idea floating around that everyone needs to be alkaline and
so start drinking alkaline water and a lot of your problems are going to be cleared out and
cancer is acid so if you stay alkaline you're going to be safe that is false information when
some people start drinking alkaline water for example because they bought this machine
i've tested the urine on some of these people and their urine is even at a ph of nine which
is incredibly incredibly alkaline typically the urine should be between five maybe six
when you have a ph of nine that is so far off the scale that that's going to set you up for a lot of
problems because one of the reasons why you want your ph in the urine to be acidic is to prevent
bacterial growth so this is not going to do it right here so the bottom line is i wouldn't try
to correct a ph problem by either taking something that's more acid or taking something that is more
alkaline i would do it by implementing a healthy diet i would try to focus on the diet as much as
possible and my opinion is this if you do healthy keto you're going to bring your ph within the
certain fluids at the right level in the urine and the saliva and you don't have to worry about it
number one you're going to cut down the carbs so you're going to completely starve off this candida
and then now you're not going to get the ammonia so this ph will be settled and because you're
doing healthy keto you're supplying the vegetables with all the minerals that will help balance
any acidity from the protein or even fats in summary i don't focus on the saliva ph very
much or the urine ph it doesn't give you a lot of valuable data it can be used as one indicator
to look deeper inside the body but typically when it when it comes down to it especially
from working 29 years in practice if you just get the person's diet corrected
ph comes back to where it needs to be thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

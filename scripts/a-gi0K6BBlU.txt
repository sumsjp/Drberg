all right well i found another reason why you should be doing healthy keto
surprise you know we know healthy keto helps with weight loss and many different conditions but when
you do healthy keto and intermittent fasting it can greatly help your absorption of nutrients
i mean the fasting alone is going to decrease the need for the requirements of nutrients but
what about healthy keto what can that do for your nutrients one of the biggest things it's
going to do it's going to start correcting insulin resistance whether you have diabetes pre-diabetes
or not the majority of the population has insulin resistance and that alone is going to block
the absorption of many nutrients okay the one i'm going to talk about today is calcium okay to show
you what's involved in absorbing calcium it's it goes way beyond just taking your one a day
centrum silver that a lot of people are taking or someone who's menopausal who's taking their
um calcium supplement which is basically rocks they're taking like one and a half
grams of calcium per day thinking that's going to help them with their calcium requirements
so let's kind of go through the list just with calcium number one when you fix insulin resistance
okay you're gonna instantly start helping yourself absorb calcium all right number two when you start
to do fasting and stop eating grains whole grains and refined carbohydrates you're going
to start to heal the inside of your colon reducing inflammation and all of that is going to increase
your absorption because malabsorption in your gut is a huge barrier in absorbing many nutrients zinc
and definitely calcium now i've talked a lot about vitamin d in other videos especially
as it relates to calcium vitamin d helps a person absorb calcium by 20 times okay so in other words
if you're deficient in vitamin d because you're not eating the right foods or taking the right
supplements or whatever your calcium is going to be 20 times less concentrated in your blood and
calcium is very very essential not just in your bones and your muscles but from the function of
cell to cell communication i've done a whole video on that if you haven't seen that one i put a link
down below it's pretty interesting if you're on the wrong diet because you're not doing healthy
keto you're inevitably going to be consuming more phytates especially in whole grains and
other things like soy and that's going to block calcium zinc iron and other minerals and then
there are other foods that can actually block nutrients as well like foods high in oxalates
spinach chocolate almonds block calcium it doesn't help you if they're high in oxalates because
that calcium is unavailable to you now keto has moderate protein okay it's not high protein it's
a moderate protein there are some reports that show that when you actually do too much protein
that can deplete some of your calcium as well it's not just about taking a nutrient it's about
absorbing the nutrient and there's a lot of things that you can be doing and taking that can be not
only blocking these nutrients but causing these nutrients to be eliminated through your body
and then when you have hormonal imbalances not just insulin being a problem but also estrogen
that can influence calcium as well and this is why like women that go through menopause that have
an imbalance with estrogen can be deficient in calcium and it has nothing to do with taking
calcium it has to do with the hormone imbalance that doesn't allow you to utilize calcium
properly and then we get to your stomach acid if you don't have enough stomach acid you're not
going to absorb calcium too well you're not going to absorb iron too well you're not going to absorb
magnesium too well and so one of the cool things about healthy keto is it's going to naturally
start clearing up conditions that can lead to low stomach acid and also include as a part of it
sea salt which is very necessary in building your stomach acid and one more point if you're not on
healthy keto and you're doing a lot of refined carbohydrates those refined carbohydrates are
going to greatly increase the demand for many nutrients like vitamin b1 calcium in fact in
the presence of glucose your body will not be able to absorb vitamin c it's going to absorb
the glucose instead why because the chemistry in glucose and vitamin c are very very similar and
so again it's not just about taking nutrients it's about getting them in your body and being absorbed

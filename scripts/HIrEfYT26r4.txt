so let's talk about the symptoms of GERD what is GERD GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disorder
and basically in a thumbnail sketch it's a chronic problem with the valve on top of your stomach it
won't close that well and all the acid kind of comes up now the problem with that is that
there are certain enzymes in the stomach certain enzymes that are protein enzymes that are really
really powerful that can break down a steak in your stomach that thing gets up there it can
actually start dissolving the esophagus all it went up and irritate up into your throat
and that's why these are the symptoms acid reflux belching excessive saliva food gets or a feeling
that food gets stuck in your throat sore throat hoarseness even a sour taste okay so those are
some of the symptoms but you know if you look up GERD it'll say well we don't really know what
causes it it's an unknown cause no one really knows but let's just look at the physiology I
think it's important to understand that there is a cause for every symptom and that is this
this valve is linked to the pH of your stomach the physiology of what closes that valve is what
the pH is down here normally the pH should be between one and three now let's take a look at
this pH a neutral pH is 7 anything lower is acid anything higher is alkaline so if it's 7 and it
goes from 7 to 6 that means that 6 if you have a pH of 6 that's 10 times more acid than 7 okay so
it compounds by a factor of power of 10 every whole number lower so 1-3 is extremely acidic
okay as you age you lose this pH especially if you if you have any heartburn and things chances
are you definitely your pH is probably four five six all right there are certain tests that could
be done but a lot of times you have to request them and it's hard to find someone to do a test
to measure the pH but what I would do if I were you is I would take and acidifier and see if you
get better like it's a it's an inexpensive way to see if that was the problem okay so if you need a
good one a natural acidifier have one below the link below but what you want to do is you want
to make the stomach more acidic so this valve will close and what you do is you take these
acidifiers before the meal sometimes you will take start with like three four maybe even five
at first and then you can take less over time but if this stomach is not between one and three this
valve won't close you'll get undigested food get some gas all sorts of problems because
we need this pH to digest protein and absorb minerals those are the two big factors okay
hope this helped I'll see you next video hey guys thank you so much for watching I really

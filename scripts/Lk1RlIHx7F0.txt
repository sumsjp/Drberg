take a look around and notice that there
are different body types and if you take
a closer look you'll notice that there
are only four not five not three but
four different shapes or body types
people fall into
in this first shape you're going to
notice the extra fat is stuck in the
belly area
in the second weight is being held in
the belly but more of a protruding type
like a pot belly
in the third one you'll see weight is
evenly held all over the body not in any
one location but all over
in the fourth one you'll notice that the
fat is mostly on the hips buttocks and
sometimes in the lower stomach as a
pooch
hey if you're having any challenge with
losing even just a little bit of weight
you need to watch the following video
i would like to share with you a hidden
not widely known fact regarding why fat
builds up and gets stuck in one part of
the body versus another part
there's a perception that fat people are
lazy not as intelligent and just need to
eat less and exercise more
hmm interesting theory but there's only
one little tiny problem with this how do
you explain the skinny guy that can eat
anything he wants and he never gains an
ounce and what about the overweight
person who barely eats anything is
exercising two hours a day seven days a
week and still hasn't lost anything
these are the variables or exceptions
that some of the so-called experts don't
really talk about
you're going up a very steep hill
there's so much false information out
there there's so much garbage all
designed to cut calories and burn fat
and stimulate your metabolism when in
fact the truth is that your metabolism
is already burnt out or it's burning out
so we want to heal the body and that's
the program you need to be on
to receive full access of the body type
video now please enter your email to the
right of the screen i will see you on
the other side

my name is Angela
Hightower uh I'm just turned I'm 48
years
old and I've always I guess
been not really uh obese but as a child
I grew up a chubby child and throughout
life like in the 20s I kind of slimmed
down a little bit and then by mid-40s
start to spread out I mean I tried other
other uh methods uh Weight Watchers and
it did work for a while you know and
then comes back so I had uh gone to see
my primary care doctor and I got on a
scale and I weigh 200 lb and I had never
weighed 200 lb in my life so I was like
something has to be done and I also have
a history of high blood pressure and
hypertension and it's also in my family
so keeping with those things in mind I
knew I had to make some changes um in my
lifestyle and for my weight so I was
about to to sign up again with Weight
Watchers and I had seen Dr
Berg couple of times on TV and then I
heard a radio commercial about the free
consultation so I decided to uh come in
and see what Dr Berg's program was about
the first visit was uh was on a Friday
my office was kind of busy
um after the well the initial test kind
of scared me you know I I didn't really
know what to expect having the the
stress tests and all that but once I got
through that and had you know a
one-on-one with Dr Berg I um I felt good
about the program I felt that it wasn't
like a a fluke or scam um and I actually
asked him how did he get into doing this
type of um
Healthcare so I was yeah the first visit
was impressive present I learned from
the first visit that I
already uh had uh some of the methods in
place but I just didn't know how and
what really resonated with me was by
talking to Dr Berg and getting the book
and I had a guide so I had a guide that
I could follow and and
um that was good if you want to learn
more about your body body and to keep
your body healthy I would
encourage everyone to stop by and see
it

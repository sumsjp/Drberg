let's talk about bile sludge it is a real thing
and what it is it's a pre-gallstone state
gallstones develop over a period of time from
sludge and what we're talking about is a concentration of cholesterol
without the thinning agent which is bile so that's really what it is
and it can create a lot of problems now in
bile salts you don't just have bile salts
there's some cholesterol crystals there's calcium salts
there's bilirubin which is a byproduct of red blood cells when red blood cells
get old or damaged bilirubin is the byproduct of that
there's salt there's mucin which is a compound
involved in the mucous layer that lines the inside of the body
and the gut and the mouth it's all over the place and then of
course there's bile salts so the more we have of this and the less
we have this we start developing sludge and then it turns into a stone this
happens quite frequently in pregnancy because there's so much
pressure on your abdominal cavity up into these organs right here the
pancreas the bladder and the liver then you get the
stasis or stagnant sludge that can develop in the stones
realize you have two types of bile salts you have
bowel salts that are made from your liver and also bile salts that are made
from your microbes so if you had a history of
antibiotics and you destroy the friendly bacteria
that can create a bile deficiency and then increase your bile sludge
when you get a gastric bypass you're going to increase the risk of getting
stones because you alter the mechanics of the small
intestine and the stomach as well and so if we
look at this we have the liver we have the gallbladder right here this
is the bile then we have the pancreas then we have
the small intestines the gallbladder gets contracted when you eat
squeezing about 70 of that bile into the small intestine
now you're also getting the pancreas that is releasing
lipase and it's going to help break down that fat at this point right in your
small intestine but many times this sludge can
get jammed up and stuck in these ducts throughout here through the pancreas and
down through here as well and then you get a lot of pressure you
get a lot of pain and inflammation and that can even cause
pancreatitis it can then back up to the liver
creating inflammation in the liver hepatitis
and eventually cirrhosis because what happens bile salts
are detergents and they're meant to be in the right place
so if they're in the wrong place let's say they're stuck up here in the liver
tissue that can create a major irritation to
the liver tissue and create a lot of side effects one of
the symptoms would be pain in the right upper quadrant right here
and so that means that we're not getting that flow through here
and the sludge can also develop in the gallbladder itself and then eventually
turn into gallstones too and prevent the release of the sludge into the ducts
one really important function of bile is the elimination
of drugs medications xenobiotics that would be any foreign chemicals to
the body drugs or chemicals toxins heavy metals fat soluble
poisons all sorts of things that shouldn't be in your body
if you have the following symptoms like pain in your
central part of your abdomen right here or in the right upper quadrant
or even the left side and if it's bile sludge
a very simple solution would be to start taking some purified bile salts on
an empty stomach what that's going to do it's going to
help release this blockage and allow the drainage to occur
through here and you're going to find the symptoms greatly diminished now
the key is taking in an empty stomach because if you take it with food
those bile salts might be focusing on digestion
and not helping you drain some of these blockages through here
now realize this is just temporary as you
implement the correct diet if you're on the correct diet
you shouldn't have any problems at all if you're new to my channel i put down
the best diet that you should be on down below check it out before you go
if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you
can call and get some help

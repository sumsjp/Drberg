we're going to talk about vitamin d's influence over your muscles
when we think of vitamin d deficiency we might think of
bone strength calcium absorption anti-inflammatory
so if you have osteoporosis for example taking vitamin d can decrease the risk
of getting a fracture also vitamin d helps decrease the risk
of falling probably more to do with the
strength of the muscle but the first symptom that happens when
you're vitamin d deficient lower back aches okay low back pain
you might get bone pain and also difficulty getting up from aceta
position so there's a huge influence of vitamin d
controlling neural neuromuscular function
but every single muscle cell called the myocyte
has a little receptor for vitamin d vitamin d
receptor so let's start at the top vitamin d helps
muscle strength whether you're climbing stairs or getting up from a seated
position or you find that you're working out and
you just feel weaker could be your vitamin d number two
vitamin d helps stabilize your posture so if you
find that you're slouching too much you may want to look
at vitamin d all right number three the proximal
muscles uh connected to your hip like the
quadricep that that's the thigh muscle on the front
part of your leg the glutes that's your butt muscle and the iliopsoas is a
muscle that connects the lower part of your legs to your upper part of your
body so these three large muscle groups
are highly influenced with vitamin d so if you're weak
in your core it could be a vitamin d deficiency
number four your physical performance can be greatly affected by your vitamin
d levels and i'm going to put a link down
below to validate all the things that i'm talking about
number five if you're deficient in vitamin d
you could have kind of certain swaying of the body when you're walking like a
waddling back and forth you've probably seen people like that when they're
walking that's a vitamin d deficiency it would
be interesting to give that person some vitamin d as a before and after to
see how that could change number six the speed
or the contractibility of the muscles is influenced by vitamin d
so if we're talking about someone who is a sprinter
they should be taking enough vitamin d all right thanks for watching

i'm going to talk about what does it mean if you have high creatinine in your blood okay so i'm
just going to show you all the reasons why this could be now there's something called creatine
that converts to creatinine which is a waste product that's supposed to be through the urine
but when it's backing up into the blood that means there potentially could be
a kidney problem but there's other reasons as well but creatine in general helps recycle
atp which is an energy currency in your muscles and your brain it's involved in
muscle metabolism also a lot of people take it for exercise performance so when you have
high levels of creatinine in your blood but it's low in the kidney it could be number one kidney
damage okay it could also be you're taking an ace inhibitor now there's other medications too that
can create this effect i didn't talk about those i wanted to talk about the most common reasons
now intense exercise because you're breaking down muscle you may have high creatine in
your blood it doesn't mean there's a kidney problem at all it just means you're exercising
and you're breaking down that compound now the more muscle mass that you have the more
creatinine you're going to have as well now this next thing is probably more relatable to
more people that are doing keto a lot of times they'll do maybe too much protein but dietary meat
especially if it's cooked it could potentially create high levels of creatinine in your blood
simply because when you heat the meat it converts creatine to creatinine okay it's non-pathogenic
it's not a problem you just might want to lower the amount of meat that you eat then you have
creatine supplements if you're taking this for performance or you're a bodybuilder or whatever
if you're having too much that may end up in the blood too it's non-pathogenic it's not a problem
you might want to just lower the amounts all right there you have it the six reasons why you may have
higher levels of creatinine in your blood before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call

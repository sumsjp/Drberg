hey guys dr. Berg here listen I wanted to do a video on maltodextrin which is basically worse
than sugar it's in so many foods and salad dressing gelatin sauces instant pudding
baked goods baby formula it's a nutritional bars so-called protein bars shakes diet shakes weight
loss shakes protein shakes Splenda they even put it in stevia so you have to just read the
labels make sure that you don't have the version that has that in it soft drinks candy vitamins
especially electrolyte powders and just powders in general and beer so this week and when you
when you drink your beer make sure it doesn't have maltodextrin maltodextrin is a thickener
and a filler it's a cheap filler that's all it is it just makes things a better texture
it's made from corn which is most definitely GMO wheat which has gluten or potato or rice
but the glycemic index is 110 it means it's very severe on your blood Sugar's compared
to table sugar is only 64 incredible so stay away from them especially if you're on the
ketogenic diet hey guys a quick survey question I want to know what topic you would like me to
do a video on so each week I'm coming up with different types of videos but I would rather
have you tell me what you're interested in so I put a link down below please fill it out

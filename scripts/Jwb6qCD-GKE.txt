okay so you're doing keto and intermittent fasting
but your darn blood sugars are still high what is going on where is the sugar coming from
it's coming from your liver and your kidney there's something called gluconeogenesis which
means the formation of new sugar and your body does always need a very small amount of sugar
you can't run a hundred percent on ketones or fat a small percentage of body tissue
runs on glucose so your body actually makes it out of non-carbohydrate sources it'll make it out of
fat it'll make it out of protein and it'll make sugar out of ketones what controls this process
is insulin insulin is supposed to turn off gluconeogenesis when you have high
sugar despite not consuming sugar what this means is there's low amounts of insulin the
insulin is really low in your body obviously it might be too low what condition would create a
situation where you don't have enough insulin well diabetes type 1 but that's very very rare
or insulin resistance which is very very very common what's interesting about insulin resistance
is it creates high levels of insulin but at the same time that insulin is not working in the body
so you don't really have the benefit of that insulin shutting down gluconeogenesis because
it's all about the receptor so the receptor in your cell is not receiving insulin so
your body is going to sense low glucose so basically your insulin is dysfunction whoops
what can you do simply focus on improving insulin resistance how do you do that number
one start exercising more to burn off the sugar and by the way when you have high blood glucose
that's not coming from your diet it's not pathological it's not going to create a disease
like it would if you were to consume too much sugar from the diet second thing you want to
increase your fasting fast longer and do it more frequently three increase more fiber as in
vegetables because the fiber is consumed by your friendly bacteria and then your bacteria starts
making something called a small chain fatty acid like butyrate and butyrate helps improve insulin
resistance that's the connection apple cider vinegar really really good to help you with
insulin resistance vitamin d essential chromium one of the best trace minerals and i forgot zinc
too zinc is also really really good to help you with that b vitamins of course nutritional yeast
is one of the best sources potassium and magnesium part of the electrolytes will help getting more
sleep will greatly help your blood sugars and decreasing inflammation since inflammation
worsens insulin resistance so anything you can do to decrease inflammation but of course if
you're doing all this that's going to bring inflammation down i did create several videos
and inflammation i put a link down below for a little more data because if you have
this chronic inflammatory condition that can kind of keep you from fully achieving your full goals
with this situation over here okay 11 just give it more time this means that you've had this
problem for quite a long time and it's going to take time to reverse it could take months
it could even take up to a year but also focus on the other indicators the other improvements if you
are feeling more energy and you're losing weight and you have no hunger and you have no cravings
so everything else is doing well that means it's working so just ride the wave give it
more time don't go back to carbs all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

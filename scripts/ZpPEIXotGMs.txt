hey Dr. Berg here in this short little video we want to talk about a great
success so we're talking about blood pressure
now before we get started I want to just let you know we're not making any claims
to cure blood pressure or any medical diseases what I do is I like to work
with the person's medical doctor as a kind of a team to work on the nutrition
part to help them increase health so then they can reduce the medication so
now you were on some medications tell us a little bit about medications you're on
and your blood pressure was pretty high right yes I was taking lipitor beta
blocker and Norwex and I forget the other ones it was a concoction of few
different medications basically very high blood pressure 160 by 110 and since
I've been coming to you and seeing but now for for a while I you introduced me
to d3 and k2 and when I started to do that along with the kale juice and all
that my blood pressure kept on going down and my physician kept on reducing
the dosage of the medication that I was taking and actually I'm completely off
the medication and I actually have low blood pressure at some times just came
off of the month of fasting in which it was a little difficult to take the D in
the d3 and k2 maybe transposing the numbers but any
event I'm back on track and I'm taking four and four everyday and my blood
pressure is completely normal I would say about 120 by 75 which is remarkable
even with the medication I was taking I was 135 hundred and thirty by eighty
eighty-five but now without medication I am even lowered that's interesting
because you know the medication obviously was not working
your wife is the radiologist and I'm sure she was happy that you're kind of
reducing your medications but I want to explain what k2 is in d3
vitamin d3 in k2 don't directly fix blood pressure what they do is they help
mobilize calcium in the arteries and you yeah I'm going to I'm going to get to
that and so the calcium that plugs up the pipe sort of speak to vessels and
they makes it more like hardened arteries the blood pressure go up
because they K 2 and D 3 and I like to do like four of each per day I like the
D 3 to be 10,000 IU's and the K 2 to be at 100 micrograms and take four of each
in the morning and then what happens is that it starts to mobilize calcium out
of the vessels not just the heart valves and the blood vessels but the arteries
through the carotid through the neck up into the brain because you had a problem
when you tilt your neck back remember you actually had pain yeah I could not
do this and I could not lie down and look up and the whole you know I I used
to the the ceiling would be turning and I don't have that problem and the only
thing I'm doing different is really taking these three and you had predicted
that that that's what triggered actually you putting me on those things and also
inside of my teeth I just had my hygienist she felt that I had a lot more
of calcium or deposits on my inside of the teeth and now I'm going every three
months so there was certainly a surplus of calcium buildup which my body I
apparently was releasing and it was sticking to my teeth what happens is
that k2 helps mobilize calcium out of the wrong place and and it helps get it
out of the system if there is an excess amount and sometimes it can come out
through the pores of your body I've had even someone coming out of the
tear ducts but most the time it just goes into the bone so yeah so anything
like soft tissue calcium arthritis bursitis tendinitis blood pressure
calcium buildup in the joints where you're really stiff can clear up with
these two nutrients so it's it's it's such a no-brainer I think within the
next three four years you're going to see a lot of people doing this
combination because it handles so many issues with people I mean as people get
older they turn into a stone they become very very stiff and they get heart
problems women that take calcium without the k2 and the d3 end up with a lot of
problems with the heart so even the medication for blood pressure one of the
medications is calcium channel blockers what's that that is a medication to get
the calcium out of the heart right now they're doing even a better scan for for
the heart which is a calcium scan they looked for plaquing calcium which is
much better than so cholesterol is a whole different thing over here but
calcium is a and more important indicator right now for overall health
so I just wanted to say this is awesome and thank you for sticking to it in your
success and I wish you the best in the future thank you very much you're
welcome

at the first sign of a kidney stone this is what you need to do but let's first talk about what
is the first sign of a kidney stone it's usually back pain okay usually on one side a little bit
higher up could wrap around to the front part it can also include lower abdominal pain on one side
but not just pain but a deep dull aching sensation that pain or achiness could also go into the groin
because the kidney is connected to these tubes that go right down into the bladder you can also
experience blood in your urine also you may feel the urge to urinate but sometimes you
can't urinate you can feel nauseous or even the urge to vomit now this is a short list of all
the symptoms but these are usually the first signs that you may have a kidney stone now
what happens with kidney stones these stones can develop in the kidney themselves or outside the
kidney to the point where this kidney stone can obstruct this tube and cause a back up pressure
that causes a lot of discomfort in the kidney because we no longer have the flow of urine
through these ducts now there's several different types of kidney stones the most common is the
oxlet stone so that's what i'm going to focus on right here all right what will be the first and
most important thing to do if you start noticing you have some of these symptoms you need to drink
minimally two and a half liters of fluid what is that going to do that is going to really hydrate
that kidney and allow for this space to open up a little bit more because there's going to be more
fluid going out there and there should be less pain the other thing that this is going to do it's
going to help prevent the super saturation of this stone forming in the first place in other words
this fluid is going to slow down and prevent the supersaturation which is the concentration
of this compound between calcium and oxalates if you have enough fluid in your body it's just not
going to develop and certain people that are prone to getting kidney stones they need to be consuming
minimally 2.5 liters of fluid every single day and that alone could potentially prevent another
stone from forming also because we're dealing with oxalates if you increase your citrates
that will help prevent the formation of these oxalate stones so one cup of lemon juice per day
wouldn't be a bad idea now this does not have to be from fresh lemons you can get it from a bottle
so even though it's pasteurized it might not have all the vitamin c but it will have the citrates
and that's what you're looking at now potassium citrate is another good
thing to take number one it's electrolyte and it's in a lot of electrolyte powders number two it has
citrate and number three if you have a uric acid stone this will help alkalize the urine to help
prevent the crystallization of that type of stone so potassium citrate will help both a uric acid
stone as well as a calcium oxalate stone as far as a diet you want to avoid foods high in oxalates
spinach almonds chocolate swiss chard beet tops peanuts all the keto friendly foods
if you happen to consume these foods a couple things you can do to prevent the formation
of the calcium oxalate stones consume some calcium with it for example you had a spinach salad well
add some cheese to that salad that'll give you the calcium or let's say you had some almonds
or peanuts well have some cheese with it that'll give you a little more calcium that'll decrease
the risk of getting those oxalates also the fiber in the spinach and the swiss chard and the beet
tops does have a tendency to reduce the formation of calcium to the oxalates as well there are also
three important supplements that can also reduce the risk of getting a kidney stone the most potent
inhibitor of kidney stones would be chondroitin sulfate berberine is another great remedy for
kidney stones not to mention it's good for insulin resistance and a pre-diabetic cod liver oil has
some really cool things it has vitamin d vitamin a and it has the omega-3 fatty acids all of
those are great in reducing the risk of kidney stones all right there you have it that's a wrap
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

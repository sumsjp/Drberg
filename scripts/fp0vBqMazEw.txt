here's a question why do carbs make us hungry
all right so there's two reasons one is that when you consume carbs you spike the hormone insulin
because the purpose of insulin is to remove the carbs from your bloodstream
and the body will then convert that into stored sugar in your liver and your muscles
and if there's excess it'll convert it to fat in different places in your body
but insulin's job is to lower glucose now when the glucose becomes lower in the blood
because you just spiked insulin this is where you're going to crave more carbs and also just
you're just your appetite's going to go up you're going to be hungry so that's number one low blood
sugars will cause you to be hungry and number two insulin itself triggers hunger so the more insulin
you have the more hungry you're going to be and there's a condition called insulin resistance
and that's created from eating chronic amount of carbs over many years to the point where your body
is compensating by producing a lot more insulin to compensate for the resistance because it can't get
into the cells and so you're going to be hungry all the time now the higher the glycemic index the
faster the insulin spike and the more that it drops down into the lower part right here and
so let's say for example you consume a bowl of rice okay and there's some type of sweet
sauce on that and you're at a restaurant like a chinese restaurant and you consume that it's like
maybe let's say it's a thai restaurant right because they have a lot of spicy great foods
and it's a lot of hidden sugar and they also have msg in there which also spikes insulin
what's going to happen you're going to feel real good for a while you're going to feel satisfied
and then you're going to leave the restaurant and all of a sudden you're going to be like man
i'm hungry where did that come from well what happened it spiked your insulin
and now it's removing all that sugar now you're going to end up with low blood sugars so you're
probably going to go home and look for something sweet because you're hungry now if you were to
have a carbohydrate like let's say a salad that is a carb it has fiber but fiber has no response on
your insulin plus it's nutrient dense you're not going to get this massive spike probably like this
and it's not going to come down too far so you're not going to get hungry after you consume a salad
now to stimulate the appetite if you really wanted to stimulate your appetite consume a lot of empty
carbohydrates refined carbohydrates breads pasta cereal crackers candy things like that sodas and
that's a great way to stimulate appetite because there's no nutrients in there to satisfy the brain
there's all sorts of receptors in the brain that are signaling and getting feedback from
the food that you eat and so one message that the brain is going to get to turn off hunger is okay
we reached our amount of nutrients if there's no nutrients in there it's not going to turn off and
you're going to keep eating and eating and eating this is why it's so easy to sit down and consume
you know loaf of bread or this is why it's so easy to sit down and consume a whole bunch of
bread or refined carbs in one sitting like doritos for example in college i used to consume
not just a small bag of doritos but the mega or a bulk bag of doritos literally it was this big
i would sit down in one sitting and consume that whole thing why because i never got satisfied it
was just good i just kept having it and then i was so thirsty afterwards because i was so filled with
sodium my fingers would swell up because all that sodium and the fluid just kind of was retained
all right another thing that will stimulate appetite is low fat or lean protein why
because low-fat protein will stimulate insulin and the other thing is that fat satisfies you and so
if there's not enough fat to satisfy you you're just doing protein and that's going to stimulate
an appetite this is why snacking on lean protein or beef jerky in between meals is not a good idea
and then frequent eating if you've been watching my videos you've heard me say this a million times
but more frequent you eat the greater the appetite why because every time you eat you trigger insulin
regardless of what you eat now this is how you satisfy your hunger more fatty foods
okay number two lower carbs i've already covered that three nutrient dense foods
that also includes nutrient-dense carbs as in vegetables cruciferous things like that
seafood is very nutrient-dense shellfish is extremely nutrient-dense organ meats
are extremely nutrient dense very satisfying okay the more fiber something has for example
if you're doing uh vegetables and like celery it's very rich with fiber that is going to buffer the
insulin response greatly so you're not going to ever gain weight or have an insulin problem when
you're consuming the carbohydrate celery all right bile if you don't consume enough fat which by the
way is the trigger of bile bile production from your liver and stored in the gallbladder you're
gonna end up with lower amounts of bile and if you don't have enough bile you can't extract some of
the fat soluble nutrients that are very satisfying to your body and also trigger your brain that you
you can turn off eating and so having enough bile having a healthy gallbladder how having a healthy
liver can give you enough bile to give you more extraction of the certain nutrients that you need
to satisfy the body if you're deficient in bile like it's like you just you're just going to feel
uh hungrier okay fasting now if you're new to my channel i'm just going to explain this
how can not eating get rid of hunger well you're actually switching your metabolism from
running on glucose especially the dietary sugars and carbs to running off your own body's fat and
to do that there's a transition it takes a little bit might take three days but you're not fasting
for three days you're just going to not eat so frequently and then what's going to happen your
body is going to convert over to running on fat and your hunger is going to completely disappear
for those people that are new to my channel i put a link down below of exactly what diet you
should be on the other cool thing about doing all of these things right here is that they fix
insulin resistance and the more you're fixing some resistance the lower the insulin will go
the faster the metabolism will be and the more satisfied you're going to be because insulin
resistance also blocks the nutrients from going into the cell so if you have insulin
resistance especially if it's chronic like a lot of people have you're going to rarely be
satisfied after you eat so that's why you have to take additional nutrients to satisfy you
all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what
about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

let's talk about the downfall of high-fructose corn syrup
it's been a real popular sweetener for the last thirty years in fact in 1980 an
average American was consuming about 20 pounds of it per year and then it spiked
in in year 2000 the 61 pounds and then in 2015
went down to 39 and if I'm not mistaken in the last couple of years it's even
downtrending from that point in fact quite a few companies are making the
shift from high fructose corn syrup to different forms of sugar
unfortunately PepsiCo Snapple Pizza Hut Kraft Foods and there's actually a
really long list of companies that are moving away from high-fructose corn
syrup the problem with high-fructose corn
syrup is that we have 53% glucose then we have 42% fructose and the rest of it
is different types of sugars and the problem is this fructose right here does
some serious damage to your liver all of your cells have receptors for glucose
but not fructose only the liver has these receptors to break down fructose
if you're consuming a lot of fructose what's gonna happen is you're gonna
overload the liver and you're gonna create all sorts of problems with
insulin resistance a fatty liver eventual cirrhosis so fructose is very
unhealthy for the liver now with ironic is sucrose table sugar
is 50/50 roughly glucose and fructose so table sugar from my viewpoint is also
very very unhealthy because it has a lot of fructose fructose is the fastest
way to fatten up your liver and your gut but also the way that they make high
fructose corn syrup is in a lab and it comes from corn starch okay and corn is GML
now cane sugar is not GMO but beet sugar and by the way there's a tremendous
amount of beet sugar still being sold and that's GMO unfortunately so
you're getting that added glyphosate that herbicide at least with cane sugar
to my knowledge you're not getting that extra added chemical glyphosate anyway
the awareness of sugar as well as high fructose corn syrup over the last few
years is creating a really good awareness and because a lot of companies
are going sugar-free they're using stevia and they're slowly going away
from this sugar and definitely the high fructose corn syrup now this is
interesting in the 70s versus nowadays okay there has actually been a decrease
by 44% in the consumption of milk if you compare these two time periods for beef
it has gone down by 33% cheese has gone up by a hundred and ninety-three percent
that's interesting and then we have yogurt check this out in the 70s versus
now it is spiked nearly 1,600 percent unfortunately it's probably not the
plain yogurt that we're talking about it's we're talking about the sweetened
yogurt there's so much extra added sugar in yogurt it's not really a healthy
product and then we get grains okay so an increase by 12.7% okay and check this
out corn between the 70's and present we
have a spike of a hundred and eighty percent increase in the consumption of
corn products but look at the corn sweeteners we had a spike of over 300%
now realize recently that has come down considerably but I had a difficult time
finding the different types of corn sweeteners because you have high
fructose corn syrup and then you also have corn syrup very different because
corn syrup is a hundred percent glucose okay whereas high produce corn syrup is
a combination so I still have not found that data but all I'm going to say is
that this has been a significant impact on obesity from my personal opinion and
we have chicken look at this beef has drop by 33% the chicken has increased by
a hundred and ten percent people are consuming more chicken because they
think it's healthier I'm gonna put a video on chicken down below you should
check it out if you haven't seen it chicken is definitely not very healthy
now we get to this interesting vegetable oils right which are basically seed oils
corn oil canola oil soy oil cottonseed oil they're all GMO that is spiked 270
percent from my opinion this has created a huge problem in our guts and our
livers and inflammation in actually gaining weight in cardiovascular health
I'm gonna save this for a different video and then soy which we're including
the soy protein isolates which is in a lot of so called keto friendly food that
is by 190 percent from these two time periods
so overall the good news is that sugar gradually is on its way out it's never
gonna go out completely but it's definitely declining and personally I
think it's because of the great awareness on the ketogenic diet if you
want to check out the video on chicken meat check it out I put it right here

all right part one breaking bad old habits okay i'm gonna give you some tips on this if
you happen to have some bad habits related to food or maybe even it could be you don't
exercise enough whatever so a lot of people are in this situation where they have these
habits and they have this routine thing of going through up and down up and down you go
through stress you your carb you feel better boredom one day you eat some carbs you feel
better you're tired that was my thing i had some seriously bad habits i used to do ben and jerry's
every single night for probably a year okay a whole pint no problem i would look forward to it
i used to do the chips potato chips i used to do popcorn at night snacking a routine
thing as i watch tv and then i started getting into um a healthier snack right an apple with
nut butters almond butter i would do that between breakfast and lunch and between lunch and dinner
okay it's a bad habit i put in a lot of weight i was like 211 pounds at one time
where i was living you could buy these margaritas at the 7-eleven and i would get into that for
probably six months of every night coming home buying this margarita and just getting in that
bad habit so i had some pretty bad habits and i have a lot of other bad habits but um it usually
starts off very pleasurable and then it gets very uncomfortable and sometimes it gives you pain
so the question i have for you is what routine do you have
what's the worst one put it down below in the comments section and once you
do that i have a question for you what is your willingness to change on a scale from one to ten
or zero to ten 0 being no willingness 10 being extremely willing or let's say 5 being
well maybe but it really depends on how easy it is go ahead and put that number down below so
a lot of times maybe friends and family that you have that are trying to get you to eat healthier
they might talk about all the negative things that could happen to you
from eating this thing or eating too many carbs but what i want to do is
i want to take a different approach i want to talk about all the good things about it
all the right things about it what's right about eating these carbohydrates
so that is a question does it make you happy does it make you feel better does it help you relax
is it more fulfilling after a long day at the office that would be something to
evaluate and look at now what i want to do is explain a little bit further what's happening
at the physical level when you are consuming routine regular carbohydrates as a bad habit
you're really oscillating between two neurotransmitters one is dopamine
which gives you the pleasure sensation and the other one is serotonin which gives you
a happy sensation happy pleasure happy pleasure back and forth
but when you are consuming these carbohydrates what you're really doing is you're satisfying
the withdrawal symptoms of these receptors that have become downgraded and they're creating an
urge to consume this carbohydrate what i want to tell you is that these carbohydrate cravings
are very unnatural they're developed over a period of time with certain chemical changes that happen
in the body when you start consuming these refined carbs over a period of time your neurology your
neurotransmitters all will start to behave in a way that now you're slightly addicted
so what is an addiction it's something that you have a strong craving for that you can't control
so what can you do about that well number one we need to increase that to a 10. you need to
decide to do it make a decision number two you need to change your routine whatever that is
you need to get the ice cream out of the house you have to make it very difficult to go buy ice cream
you also have to put yourself an environment that is not very tempting and maybe replace the refined
carbohydrates with maybe a healthier version of that maybe a keto dessert something like that
number three rid distractions there are so many things that are going to distract a person
from their goal uh you know social events having people over that have the same bad habit
those are all distractions watching the food channel that's going to distract you
from staying on track number four you got to push through the discomfort what discomfort the
withdrawal symptoms it's a feeling of pressure it's a feeling of a void that you have to fill
there's certain amount of pain and pressure and stress involved if you don't give in to these
cravings number five increase more dietary fat at the meal very very important if you're on a low
fat diet or a low calorie diet you are going to have a tough time it's very important to consume
more fat at the meal so you can then go longer and feel satisfied so you eventually can have it
where your cravings go down to zero that is the ideal scene and number six b vitamins especially
b1 from nutritional yeast which is a very natural and therapeutic thing to greatly help you because
all these neurotransmitters need the b vitamins to work correctly so you'll get relief just from that
alone all right stay tuned for part two hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

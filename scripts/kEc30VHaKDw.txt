hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the acceptable
vegetables if you're on the medication warfarin or another name for that would
be coumadin okay this medication is a blood thinner it basically blocks
vitamin K in the body so it helps you to prevent clots and when you're on this
medication they will tell you you cannot consume certain vegetable especially the
leafy greens the problem is you need the leafy greens you need for the nutrition
so we need to come up with a substitute because you need about seven plus seven
to ten cups depending on your size cups of vegetables every single day but if
you can't do salads these are some alternatives so we have tomato cucumber
artichoke zucchini celery red cabbage okra red pepper turnips beets onions
pumpkin squash eggplant mushrooms carrot and cauliflower so I'm also going to put
these down below in the description if you want to cut and paste them but these
are real acceptable low vitamin K vegetables that you need to start
consuming a lot of okay because a lot of people that I know that are on coumadin
they can't they just don't consume hardly any vegetables because they're in
a confusion but these are very very important I think it's easy to do a
bunch of celery and zucchini maybe a combination of eggplant with mushroom
cauliflower that's easy tomatoes you can do a lot of that but those are the
things that you need to start doing okay in summary we want to switch over to
these vegetables and consume them in larger amounts

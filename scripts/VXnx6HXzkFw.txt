we're going to talk about the therapeutic benefits of silica
now the form of silica that i recommend would be orthosilicic acid
now there's certain parts of your body that you have high amounts
of silica especially in the aorta and it's also in the trachea it's in the
bone and it's in the skin and the reason i'm
talking about this is as people age their skin their bones
their soft tissues their hair their nails start to become
very very rough and rigid and inelastic so silica can help slow down that
process silica stimulates collagen type one
so it's going to help your skin as an anti-aging effect especially if you have
loose skin but also the joints as well it can also
stimulate skin fibroblasts just to make your skin
toner it can help the bone mineralization the density of your bone
this is definitely one more trace mineral that you want to add to your
remedies okay number two can help decrease blood pressure
how because it increases elasticity of your arteries it's also involved in
calcification of the bone and it has similar effects to vitamin d
and as a side note vitamin d has a lot to do with absorbing
calcium in the small intestine and pushing up into the blood but it also
has an important property of calcifying the bone you need vitamin
d to calcify the bone now vitamin k2
is equally as important they both work together
and vitamin k2 is also a cofactor a helper vitamin for silica in fact
if you're deficient in k2 you're not going to get the full effect of
silica or vitamin d and vitamin k2 is a fat cycle vitamin in
certain fats also silica can help chelate aluminum so
it's great for alzheimer's patients and autistic children and adults so silica
can really help with your hair your nails and especially to keep the
elasticity uh in your skin as well now as far as
the diet goes there's a lot of silica in cereals oats
barley white wheat flour and polished rice
beer mineral water and veggies now if you've seen my other videos we
don't recommend getting it through this or this or this or this
especially not polished rice or beer but veggies and mineral water are good
but it's in other foods as well but not in higher amounts
silica prevents the absorption of aluminum in the body
which has some pretty serious effects on our brains
especially young people and babies so it's a really important factor

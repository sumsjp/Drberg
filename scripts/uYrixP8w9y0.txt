hey guys dr. Berg here I want to share with you what to do if you have tinnitus it's very very
irritating to people it's frustrating because they have this constant sound and their ears
and it can really drive them crazy but tinnitus comes from two main root causes it's usually an
earlier infection specifically viral to the inner ear which then later in life can come
out as kind of like a mucus buildup so there are natural and histamines that you can take and these
are three are the ones that I like if you could and I don't have any recommendations but if you
want to search on Amazon you can find them find a high-quality bioflavonoid okay that's part
of the vitamin C complex so bioflavonoids are really good to help the immune system get rid
of mucus garlic oh my gosh that's one of the best things for the inner ear and you could even put a
little drop in the ear but I suggest consuming it garlic is really good and oregano oil and I like
these in pearls not as a fluid that you drink but a little pearl so you can swallow them and
these three combinations will be really good if your problem is maybe an old infection that you
have this mucus on these tiny little hairs that are in the ear that are supposedly supposed to be
free of mucus if that is the real reason why you can't you have this ring in the air then
these remedies will be the best thing for you okay if it's not infection then it won't work
but it's not that expensive to try it out okay now if this doesn't work then I go to plan B it
could be a soft tissue calcium that's creating a small like a whistling effect soft tissue calcium
can build up in the inner ear and that really comes from the vitamin k2 deficiency and the
combination of consuming K 2 and D 3 together are really good remedy to pull this excess calcium
out of the soft tissue of the body so what I recommend is get the MK7 version that's
the natural version versus the mk4 and then get a hundred micrograms in each pill then then get
the d3 of the ten thousand international units okay together and I would personally I would
take four and four of these in the morning okay and within probably one to potentially two weeks
you should notice the difference if this is the real cause so because it's really hard to find
to detect what's causing it you go to doctors I don't know what to do there's no remedies don't
care there's some drugs but this is a great way to try something natural and see if it can help you

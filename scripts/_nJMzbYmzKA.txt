let's talk about an interesting cause of air hunger okay i'm talking about the symptom of
shortness of breath the medical term being dyspnea where you just can't breathe well now the typical
reasons why you might have difficulty breathing would be let's say you have asthma or a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease a problem with the lung because you had a history of smoking
or pneumonia or tb and by the way 25 of the population on planet earth
have latent tb it's a bacterial infection that goes into remission doesn't create any symptoms
in the majority population but in certain people it will come out of remission when the
resistance is low or let's say the other health problems or they get older but the majority of
people don't have any symptoms from this but it does affect the lungs and did you realize
in the year 2018 1.5 million people died of tb all right moving right along
anxiety people that have panic attacks or they have anxiety always have a weird breathing pattern
their exhalation is very very short compared to their inhalation so they're doing this
so real simple thing you could do if you have anxiety or a panic attack or you're trying to
sleep and you're worried is start to slow down your breathing where you're breathing very slowly
for about five seconds four or five seconds in and then four or five seconds out slowly
and you'll find your entire mood will change so you're you're basically affecting the autonomic
nervous system pulling yourself out of that flight or fight mode all right number six an allergy
seven anemia and even a congested gallbladder issue because it's going to swell up or it's going
to back up through the bile ducts and put pressure on your diaphragm and you need your diaphragm to
breathe and so these are the i'd say common reasons why people have air hunger but there's
another reason which is not really well known and it has to do with your ph so you have two
conditions you have acidosis and alkalosis in acidosis you get these symptoms headache fatigue
tremors sleepiness coughing and here we have shortness of breath so acidosis will definitely
cause air hunger in alkalosis we have muscle weakness muscle pain muscle cramping hypocalcemia
low calcium in the blood technique which is little twitching you get maybe somewhere in your body
and sometimes it could definitely affect the breathing as well but i didn't put it down
there because it's not very common but if you have air hunger and you want to figure out if you're
too acid to alkaline all you have to do is take some calcium or magnesium or potassium
and see if you can start breathing better okay and that could indicate that you're maybe too acid
now or you can start taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride which is an acidifier
and if you can start breathing better then we know this could be the cause of that problem now
the three things that might cause alkalosis would be you don't have enough stomach acid so you have
a lot of digestive problems and bloating or high levels of cortisol chronic stress
or low potassium will cause alkalosis as far as acidosis goes this usually happens when you have
severe liver problems a version of it can occur if you're doing a longer fast because you're into
some serious ketosis and ketones are more acidic or it could be that you're drinking too much apple
cider vinegar or in my case i started drinking too much kombucha tea and i started to develop
acid acidosis so i just simply took some calcium boom it went away and then i just made sure when i
drank kombucha tea that i only had a little bit so anyway i just want to increase your awareness
and expand all the potential causes of air hunger thanks for watching before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

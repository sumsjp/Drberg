I had a recent question from someone that wanted it now is the niacin flush harmful or dangerous
well the answer is no it is not harmful or dangerous what's happening you're
getting this massive relaxation of the muscles inside your blood vessels it's
called vasodilation and that's occurring because niacin increases something called prostaglandins
now what is a prostate glandin it's a lipid or fat compound that has a hormone effect
and prostaglandins increase vasodilation they help reduce blood pressure it helps blood clotting
it's also involved in headaches and fever this is why when you take an aspirin which blocks
prostaglandins and it can reduce a fever so that's really what's happening when you're getting this
flushing red response some people don't like it they think it's going to damage something
some people like it i actually like it myself i like that flushing response but it's not
dangerous at all the thing you need to know about niacin is that it therapeutically has been used
over 50 years and it is the most effective natural agent for increasing your hdl the good cholesterol
by 20 to 40 percent it also can decrease the ldl specifically the small dense type the damaging
ldl and it can has the potential to decrease your triglycerides now of course if you did the
ketogenic diet and your intermittent fasting that would help your cholesterol greatly but if you're
concerned about cholesterol you should be on niacin for sure but you would have to take higher
amounts of it one to two thousand milligrams a day now if you take the type of niacin that
is non-flushing it doesn't have those cholesterol lowering benefits now the other thing that niacin
has been proven beneficial for is by reducing schizophrenia there's some great data on this i'm
going to put some links down below but niacin has many other benefits but these are two big benefits
if you haven't seen my other videos on niacin i'm going to put them up right here check them out

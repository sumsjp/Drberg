so i'm doing a series of videos on natural plants and herbs that mimic the effectiveness of certain
medications and of course anything that i'm about to say is not meant to diagnose you replace your
medical care check with your doctor before trying out these ideas but today we're going to talk
about passion flower and its effectiveness acting as a sedative in a 2001 clinical trial passion
flower was as effective as relieving anxiety as oxazipan which is a conventional tranquilizer
with fewer side effects in a rat study which i'm going to put those studies down below there was a
significant increase in deep sleep as well as an improvement in falling asleep more quickly and so
the active compound in passionflower increases gaba now gaba is an inhibitory neurotransmitter
neurotransmitters are like hormones that travel through the nervous system and gaba slows things
down it inhibits excitement so you're going to feel more calm it regulates your mood and nervous
anxiety to make you more calm and the benefits of passion flower are anti-anxiety improvement
in your sleep cycle uh decrease of pain decreasing menopausal symptoms as well as improving adhd so i
put some links down for more data so check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

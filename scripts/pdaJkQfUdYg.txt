hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about how they diagnose something called
ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder this is really a complete joke based on all subjective
findings there's no objective anything it's a bunch of psychiatrists of the room that vote
on this but check this out this is how they would diagnose a second-grader okay has trouble getting
started on tasks getting dressed putting away toys ignores directions or delays in following
directions hard time sitting during meals digits talks when they're expected to be quiet as trouble
stopping one activity to begin another struggles to slow down enough to do things carefully needs
to be reminded a lot to stop and listen as a hard time paying attention grabs things without
permission is them unable to wait for directions as it takes too much time to complete tasks has
trouble remembering directions has trouble recalling facts they just learned very upset
were annoyed over minor frustrations these are all normal things normal behaviors for a second grader
and as soon as they label them that's one thing and then they just put them on a drug this is a
great book called the hyperactivity hoax by Sidney Walker MD I mean it's all about keeping kids quiet
stopping them slow down stop wait I mean this is going to mess up a kid if we keep stopping
them stopping them and like just have this quiet child that is supposed to be normal and then this
is this is one little point I want to mention with hyperactivity often digits with hands and
feets and squirms in the sea often leaves the seed in a classroom in other situations when they're
supposed to be sitting I mean you try to take a child and put am innocent sit for long periods
of time it's not natural to do that often runs about and climbs excessively in situations which
is inappropriate often is difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly how you
going to play with something quietly that this it's a joke often on the go and often acts if driven by
a motor I'm serious that's one of the criterias often talked successfully what if their social
listen all these behaviors are normal for a child and this is the biggest scam a hoax these kids I
know the nutrition could be improved they never look at the diet they never look at the nutrition
there are minerals in the body and vitamins that slow the motor down that get a child to be more
calm okay if it's excessive be one is the number one thing get a natural B one from nutritional
yeast mix it with even if you have to add a little bit of a you know low sugar chocolate with peanut
butter to get the child to consume it with some nutritional yeast or put in applesauce get the B
one in there nutritional yeast that will chill out the child like that of course got to get
them off the sugar unfortunately a lot of parents start the kid on sugar we don't want to do that we
want to not have sugar in the house but I have a lot of recipes I'll put a link down below of
all these great foods if you're a parent you need to start making these for the kids they will not
know the difference between a low-carb treat and a sugar filled treat it's it's like way way better
in it's healthier potassium we have to find a vegetable that they like do the kale shake and
put maybe bananas and fruit in there so that you don't take taste the kale and have them consume
it that will give them so much potassium you'll see the child will have more control their own
body but this out-of-control situation is purely physical it's not a mental problem preservatives
they could be allergic to something in some chemical I mean the amount of all the junk
food has msg it's a neurotoxin and magnesium that's in the vegetables so that's a these two
minerals are breaks on the nervous system they calm the nervous system I will guarantee doing
this simple thing will probably handle near a hundred percent of these kids with this is
so-called disorder okay put your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing

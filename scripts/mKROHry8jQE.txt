so i recently did a video on a very effective psoriasis cream that you can get on amazon i mean
it works very very well but the problem is there are several comments in this youtube video that i
did that mentioned china sometimes adds cortical steroids to their creams and that could be the
reason why it works so well and so this cream is supposed to only have certain herbal combinations
and i looked up several ingredients and i found that there are some pretty effective properties
in these herbal creams that can act to reduce inflammation and so that's why i recommend it but
the problem is if they added these steroids that would be very very bad so i deleted the video and
bought some cream myself and sent it to the lab to test for these steroids and i wanted to report
back to you we tested five different steroids and they were none detected so that's the good news
so if you do have psoriasis this product may be beneficial to you i put a link down below
to order some i have no affiliation with this company i've never reached out to them but i
just found it to be very effective in certain individuals and so it's a chinese herbal cream
that works for eczema psoriasis and dermatitis so you might want to check it out and see if it can
work for you as well hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

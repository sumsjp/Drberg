hey guys it's dr. Berg in this video I'm going to show you how to get rid of
pain after gallbladder surgery so a lot of people have pain so what happens is
the gallbladder is on the right side right here and they remove the
gallbladder now what happens you have a little tube from your liver on the right
side coming down into the small intestine so it's called a bile duct and
bile B-I-L-E is a fluid needed by your body to digest fats and to absorb
essential healthy fats and also fat-soluble vitamins vitamins A D E K K2
because when you don't have a gallbladder you're usually going to be
deficient in bile because you no longer have that sack to squeeze all that bile
into the digestive tract so it's not there you might start showing symptoms
of a bile deficiency bloating right shoulder pain because there's a nerve that
goes to the right shoulder you might have night vision issues dry skin and a
whole bunch of other issues okay but I'm going to show you in this video what to
do if you have pain so the gallbladders on the right side and then what you want
to do is you want to press with your hands on the opposite mirror image of
where the gallbladder is so let's say the gallbladder is right here you're
going to press on the opposite side and get right in there it's right by the
pancreas basically you're going to take your thumb press in there massage on the
opposite point okay I'm not going to explain why this works but it just works
now when you actually take the gallbladder where it was and you press in
the opposite side it's going to be very very tender and you'd be like why does
that hurt but it won't hurt unless you press on it that that means that you're
on the right spot so just use your own tolerance as far as how much pressure
you do and just kind of massage that for maybe two minutes once a day for at
least a week you will not have any pain on your gallbladder area any more it's
so simple and you don't want to press on the gallbladder press on the opposite
side but sometimes the pain goes over to the liver on the right
side then you just press on wherever the pain is over here you press on the
opposite side okay that's all I want you to do and then write your comments below
because I think you're going to be quite impressed how fast this works because
it's unnecessary for you to have that pain the other thing I'm going to
recommend that you consider is getting something called the Gallbladder Support
Formula because that has purified bile salts to replace what you're missing
because you don't have a gallbladder so you just take one for breakfast or you
might even need one with a meal but that would be essential because if you don't
have bile you could create deficiencies down the road and the fat-soluble
vitamins and also healthy fats because you can't absorb them so you may want to
take that in addition to doing the acupressure on the opposite side so write
your comments below and I'll see you in the next video

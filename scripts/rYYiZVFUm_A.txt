now i do read a lot of your comments and i get a lot of great ideas for doing videos and i did
recently get an idea for a video from someone that wanted to know um what's better cottage
cheese or plain yogurt so that's why i did this video now if we compare cottage cheese
with plain yoghurt cottage cheese is going to definitely be better it's more keto friendly
let's take a look at the fat if we compare them side to side from a serving size of 100 grams the
fat is 4.3 grams for cottage cheese and 3.5 grams for plain yogurt carbs 3.4 grams versus 4.7 grams
from yogurt so yogurt has more carbs and then we have protein 11 grams versus 3.5 grams from plain
yogurt so cottage cheese has a good amount of protein so cottage cheese also has some good
b vitamins we have b12 b2 b1 there's other b vitamins it has a good amount of calcium
and phosphorus for your bones it has selenium zinc and even vitamin d but you need to read the back
of the label when you buy cottage cheese because you're going to find when you read the label a
lot of times it'll have maltodextrin which is definitely the worst thing you can consume if
you're on the ketogenic diet i mean if you take a look at glucose being 100 on the glycemic index
maltodextrin is a lot higher than that so it's not keto friendly also some cottage cheese has
modified food starch that is another name for monosodium glutamate and msg is one chemical
that certain scientists use to fatten up their mice in certain obesity studies because msg
has the potential to spike insulin and if you're doing dairy make sure it's organic
cottage cheese make sure it's whole milk versus low-fat cottage cheese and definitely
make sure they don't add the maltodextrin and the msg hidden as modified food starch
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love
to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

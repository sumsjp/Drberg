all right today we're going to talk about the number one addictive drug in the world now this
drug is something that even i am addicted to and no it's not heroin or cocaine or tobacco
or alcohol it's caffeine now as you know caffeine is not just in coffee it's in tea cola it's even
in chocolate it's in sports drinks but of course caffeine is more of a socially acceptable drug
simply because it doesn't have a tremendous amount of side effects
in small amounts but if you have too much of it it can affect your heart
causing heart palpitations it can increase the blood pressure it can cause insomnia because
one cup of coffee or one caffeinated beverage can stay in your body for eight hours so if
you're doing this through the day and you have this caffeine in your bloodstream
because your liver doesn't have a chance to break it down you're not gonna have a good night's sleep
that is why i only consume a very small cup it's strong but i do one a day it's probably about a
four ounce cup it's really small personally if i do more than that i won't be able to sleep you
have to realize that anytime you drink coffee or caffeinated beverages it depletes vitamin b1 and
then you're going to get that jittery feeling and if you do get the jitters take some nutritional
yeast filled with good b vitamins and you'll see that we'll just go right away also caffeinated
beverages will deplete your calcium reserves and also caffeine can actually increase your anxiety
even make you depressed because over time when you drink it you become more dependent on it and
the effect that it creates becomes less and less to the point where you need a little bit more and
more and more personally i can just stay with one cup and i'm good with that and personally
if i didn't have symptoms if i drink too much i probably would keep drinking just because i like
the taste but of course in college i abused coffee i used to drink two pots of cuban coffee every
day not cups pots and this is why i only drink one per day now what's interesting is that 87
of the adult population in the u.s drinks caffeinated beverages giving them an average
of 164 milligrams of caffeine every single day now there's some interesting effects that caffeine has
on your brain it increases alertness increases the sense of well-being if you don't do too much
it makes you more awake and it even makes you more social i mean there's actually even shops or
stores that just sell coffee and they have tables or you can sit around and socialize but here's how
it works there's a chemical compound in your body called adenosine an adenosine is a chemical that
makes you sleepy or extremely relaxed and caffeine blocks adenosine so basically it blocks the brake
pads of your brain or your central nervous system so basically it gets rid of that sleepiness
or drowsiness or sluggishness it kind of wakes you up it doesn't give you any fuel it just gets rid
of the inhibitory function of the central nervous system but here's the really important part about
drinking coffee that goes beyond just drinking too much i highly recommend you only drink
organic coffee why because coffee beans are one of the most chemically treated plants that exist
i'm talking about spraying them with pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides and
unfortunately coffee has grown in certain parts of the world that's not always regulated so sometimes
you don't know what you're getting but check this out 97 of all the coffee sold on planet earth is
conventional it's not organic only three percent of the coffee is organic so given the massive
amount of population that drinks coffee and other caffeinated beverages and the great majority
is conventional it's a lot of people being exposed to pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides
those chemicals mimic estrogen in your body those chemicals mess with your
endocrine system they're called endocrine disruptors just another reason to include
cruciferous vegetables in your diet on a regular basis why because they can help you clear out
the endocrine disruptors but the most important thing you should do is just drink organic coffee

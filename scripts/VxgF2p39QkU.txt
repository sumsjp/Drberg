so let's talk about the number one cause of chronic fatigue if you're over the age of 50.
i have some very interesting information this has to do with low stomach acids
let me give you a little background first the purpose of stomach acid hydrochloric acid is
to number one break down protein into amino acids number two to help you absorb minerals like iron
and magnesium calcium etc but also hydrochloric acid is also necessary for helping you absorb b12
so both types of anemia is related to low stomach acid also the hydrochloric acid is necessary to
kill microbes in your gut if you don't have enough acid you can develop a condition called sibo small
intestine bacterial overgrowth and the problem with that condition is you have other microbes
which are in a place where they shouldn't be the small intestine
competing for your nutrients so that's one reason why you're going to be tired right there
but if you're anemic because of either iron or b12 even at the subclinical level you are going to be
tired not to mention if you consume protein especially red meat and you can't digest it
you're going to get tired so there's many reasons why low stomach acid leads to fatigue
and just as a side note if you don't have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach you can get gerd
indigestion bloating allergies and even gallstones now what's the significance of hydrochloric acid
and your age as you get older you produce less and less hydrochloric acid in fact there's one
study which i'll put a link down below that talked about a high percentage of postmenopausal women
having low stomach acid and that was up to 40 percent so that's that's pretty high also there's
another condition called atrophic gastritis in which a person has atrophy of certain parts of
their stomach caused by low stomach acid and that usually occurs if you're over the age of 60. so
this acid is so bodily important especially when you get older especially in the area of nutrients
because the older you get the more absorption of these nutrients that you need now there's
also a condition called idiopathic which means unknown cause iron deficiency anemia and one
study which i'll put down below discusses the high rate up to 44% of the population who has idiopathic
iron deficiency anemia has a chlorhydra which is a lack of stomach acid so what you need to
know is a lot of people don't have enough acid in their stomach and things get worse as you
age and this directly relates to your energy level other causes of low stomach acid could be
having severe hypothyroidism being on a low salt diet not having enough potassium in your diet
having low amounts of iodine having low amounts of zinc these nutrients are needed
in producing hydrochloric acid and of course if you're on an antacid that can also be a root cause
as well so what is the solution to all this very simple start taking betaine hydrochloride it's a
natural acidifier and i would recommend taking between four and five just before you eat and
sometimes in the beginning you might need actually more than that when you're starting
out also realize that it might take some time to reestablish this hydrochloric acid especially
if it's a chronic problem but you should notice some significant results within
days to maybe up to a week and one last point the only contraindication that i know about
with betaine hydrochloride is if you have an ulcer and you're going to find out real quick because if
you take this if you have an ulcer you're going to have a burning sensation but for the majority of
population you're going to feel better you're going to have more energy and you're going to
digest a lot better all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

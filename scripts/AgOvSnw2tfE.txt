had another response from someone that said keto did not help my joint pain so i just
wanted to create a video on this one topic um if you're trying keto and your joint pain doesn't
go away well then definitely add intermittent fasting and normally when you lower your carbs
and you do fasting your pain will go away and your inflammation will go way down why because ketones
are anti-inflammatory compounds not to mention when you do fasting you go through autophagy and
that's your body's way of recycling old damaged proteins so that's going to help the joint repair
as well and fasting will greatly improve your immune system and that has to do with improving
the inflammatory processes because your immune system has everything to do about inflammation now
there's several reasons why keto and intermittent fasting may not help you you may have some type
of advanced djd degenerative joint disease and this condition involves osteophytes like little
spurring breakdown of cartilage collagen and the synovial fluids so you could have just basically
bone on bone and you're going to have pain so in certain situations you may need surgery but there
are things that you can do to help that like the next two things i'm going to talk about if you are
low in vitamin d3 you could do keto and fasting but you might still have joint pain because you
might be low in vitamin d3 vitamin d is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatories
so vitamin d3 and at the dosage of about 20 to 30 or even 40 000 IUs per day
now number three low vitamin k2 vitamin k2 helps transport calcium deposits from the
joint to the bone and so if you have little calcium deposits or spurring whatever you may
benefit from k2 especially if you have knee pain i recommend about i don't know three to four hundred
micrograms of k2 and the version i would recommend would be mk7 okay that's the natural version
so that can help you and i i would recommend taking d3 and k2 together if you want more
information on that i put a link down below now if you're consuming too much oil that's omega-6
that alone can really spike your inflammation now of course if you've been watching my videos
you know what this means but for those of you that don't know omega-6 we're talking about the
vegetable oils corn oil soy oil canola cottonseed oil those oils are in the dressings it's in the
mayonnaise it's in a lot of foods so you want to avoid those oils but it's also in safflower oil
sunflower oil which you might want to keep to a minimum and also in nut oils and nuts
so if you're consuming a lot of nuts this could be throwing your ratios off and then also low
omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids like in olive oil which i recommend are great for
an anti-inflammatory and then you have another situation where you have right shoulder pain
so this is gallbladder and so your joint pain is not coming from your joint it's being referred
from the gallbladder if you have right shoulder pain you really need to get the full information
on this and i created a video down below and you need purified bile salts and you need to change
your diet a little bit and the last thing is if you have knee pain and keto and if is not helping
it could be you have muscle compensation let's say you had an old fracture to your ankle or
a sprain ankle or a problem with your foot and now you have knee pain what's happened is your
body is overcompensated so the muscles have been in guarding mode and that's going to put stress
on the other knee so let's say for example you have pain in the left knee i will guarantee the
right thigh muscle is going to be probably in spasm especially in the outer part right here
so you'd want to massage down that thigh muscle the quadricep especially the outside all the way
up into the hip and you do that every single day and you'll find even the first time you do this
your pain is going to be greatly reduced okay i created a specific video on this as well so you
can check it out now you know the reasons why keto and fasting may not help you with your joint pain
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

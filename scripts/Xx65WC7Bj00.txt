hello hi we're back we are back and today we are going to make looks like
you got a convention today okay okay okay okay all right what are we making
we're making a convention we're making apparently something a door is needed
for that's right that's what we're making all right and we are making
coconut oh my aprons all messed up - you guys didn't tell me we're making a
coconut almond fudge fat bomb hmm sounds delicious
it is delish so apparently it has coconut and fudgy it's rolled in coconut
sir mmm it's a fudgy inside and it's imma go I'm not gonna lie cuz you know
I'm not a liar I doubled the nuts on the inside for my recipe today because I
like a crunchy fat bomb other people like a creamy do what you do but um so I
have a question yeah okay so is it important to do Keto with IF IF
stands for intermittent fasting yeah is it important it is crucial why because it
is the eating that spikes the insulin uh-huh
gonna get it right mhm and and a relationship to what we're doing
snacking right snacking will increase the insulin and stop your fat and make
you fat thank you remember John this guy John John he made fat bombs right Oh
Johnny if you're watching this yeah basically ate like a thousand of these in a
day he said I'm yeah I'm on keto yeah
I'm not losing weight no he gained weight yeah he gained
weight and he had he made the fat bomb recipe but he said I love him but I made
cookies I said what do you mean you made cookies because we this was a recipe we
put them in a little mold like a little mold like this and he just poured him on
a pan and they were like this big and he said you have having four or five of
them a night I gained four pounds you guys knew there was more than one
problem in that story this is meant to do like one
per day so what's the secret of just doing one a day versus
doing a lot of them but what if you eat two meals a day then you just
have one it's so see here's the problem it's so easy to eat a ton of these that
you just want to do one now and then test the waters because some people can
do two some people could do more but the point is that that is like creamy fudge
you could actually very easily over do these too much yeah you could overdo it
so what's the secret to doing this one hiding them having very small recipe and
so you just make one you have trick questions I don't know the answers I'll
keep prompting until you get the right one Karen okay well let's just show them
how to make it because your mouth is filled all right check it out

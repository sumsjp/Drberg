hey guys dr. Berg here listen I had a recent question that related to can a woman control
where fat burning occurs because they had heavier hips but when they started doing the
program they lost mainly the upper part of the body first so I'm going to talk about why that
is unfortunately the body will go after the inter intra-abdominal fat first that's the visceral fat
around the midsection okay before you get to the lower section then it'll work on the subcutaneous
fat in the upper part of the body and lastly the lower part of the body the hips and the
thighs now one little point about the hips and the thighs about 50% of that is usually from my
observation more of an atrophy situation not all fat so when you start losing you're going to have
to start building the muscle underneath the fat okay because atrophy is a loss of muscle tissue
now just by doing the in a minute fasting and the ketosis you're going to improve your muscle you're
going to salvage that but you're going to have to do something to get a lot of blood flow going in
the areas that you need to tone because that will bring in more hormonal health so we want to handle
the atrophy I've actually put a video down below of that three videos and atrophy you can check
that out okay so when you exercise to improve the atrophy and you work that muscle you want to do a
combination of high intensity interval training okay to stimulate growth hormone but you also
want to work on specific body parts you want to do you probably want to get a personal trainer
or someone that has some knowledge to really work out the entire body especially the areas that you
want to work on mainly for the muscle development and the contouring and the tightening the other
point I want to bring up about that is you want to make sure that you don't over train or else
you're not going to get anyone anywhere I had a gal who came in the office she lifted three and
a half million pounds over a course of a year and lost two pounds okay so she's working out
massive weights over training okay over training so I put her on a completely different workout of
like once or twice week she started losing so started getting improvement so you really want
to make sure your sleep is good you want to make sure that your recovery is really good and maybe
twice a week would be perfect give yourself time to recover very vital about 85% of the improvement
in both men and women will come from your diet so that diet has to be really squeaky clean and a
combination of keto and intermittent fasting for those of you that have never seen those videos
I've put some links down below and 15 percent of it is actual exercise so if you think you're
going to just do an exercise without the diet good luck it's not going to happen especially
if you're over the age of 30 or 40 or 50 and then we've come to this thing called estrogen estrogen
dominance a lot of women that have heavy cycles or hot flashes or have weight in the lower part
of the body are estrogen dominant okay I put some links down below of what to do if that's
your situation but that could inhibit your weight loss simply because estrogen puts the fat on the
lower part of your body so you're going to have to also really make sure that you don't consume
any hidden estrogens and you food that mimics estrogens especially the soy so you're going to
do more organic things like that the other thing is that during menopause the relative ratio of
estrogen will will be higher than progesterone because the progesterone just crashes so you
had this ratio of now now you end up with like heavy estrogen low progesterone in that
situation again you're going to have to consume foods that are anti estrogenic simply because
that could be the reason why you're heavy in the lower part so kale brussel sprouts broccoli all
that is really important to help balance estrogen there's some other things as well I'll put it down
below but the point is that unfortunately you can't necessarily target the lower part
of your body with weight loss right off the bat it's going to take some time now the estimation
of effort is probably going to be more than you think if you're frustrated you're at the gym and
you try new things and you're not seeing anything with your thighs or but honestly you may have to
wait six to eight months to see some significant change okay sometimes up to a year or more why
just because the body sometimes has been broken down so much it takes a while to repair because
it's all about getting healthy first then lose weight the thing that you want to look at is
are you losing inches in your stomach are you feeling better are you sleeping better is your
stress sounds better hang with it keep going it's eventually going to come off and then with the
other things with exercise you eventually tone the lower part as well this is just based on
observation alright thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report

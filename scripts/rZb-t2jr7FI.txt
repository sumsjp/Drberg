all right so you're stressed out you want to know what to do there's some
really really important things okay and definitely watch this entire video
because I'm gonna demonstrate a very very powerful series of techniques to
help you with stress using an acupressure technique that it came up
with and it really really works all right number one
a mineral relaxation bath this is what you do you take a quarter cup of
Himalayan sea salt quarter cup of epson salts that's magnesium sulfate okay and
a third of a cup of apple cider vinegar and 15 drops of eucalyptus essential oil
okay you put that in your tub the combination of the hot water and these
minerals okay and this mineral and the apple cider vinegar altogether will
greatly promote relaxation the smell of eucalyptus alone will calm the nervous
system magnesium is known to help reduce adrenal stress and promote a good
night's sleep and having 70 plus minerals and I'm talking about minerals
and trace minerals all together are very very therapeutic to calming the body
down and you're also going to notice that your skin is gonna be very amazing
when you come out of this bath so I really think you'll like this
combination the next thing they do is you go on the long walks
minimally 45 minutes okay get out in nature unless you're quarantined or you
can't leave your house but ideally you want to get out there and you just want
to get a lot of fresh air and a lot of space very very important next one
twenty minutes of Sun per day if there is a Sun out there that Sun combined
with vitamin D will help recharge the adrenals and believe it or not it will
help you sleep at night as well and not to mention the vitamin D
produced from the sun rays are so important for the immune system for
reducing inflammation but it's also good for your adrenals okay next thing avoid
the news because this is constantly putting out negativity negativity you
don't need any more of that right now you want to keep your stress as low as
possible now I personally spend about 10 minutes in the morning and 10
it's a night stretching essential for a good night's sleep and the next thing
and I think most importantly is acupressure I'm going to show you right
now how to do this and I'm telling you even know you might not be into
acupressure or I think it's voodoo it's not it's very effective and I'll
show you the techniques you just have to try it and see for yourself all right
the first thing you're gonna do and you need to have someone watch this video
maybe a friend a family member well probably a family member since you're
probably quarantined right now and you can actually do it on each other what
you're gonna do is you're gonna take your hand okay
your middle finger right here I'm not flipping anyone off and your thumb and
you're gonna press you're gonna support the for the forehead so you know push it
forward and right underneath the skull you're gonna take your fingers and press
inward and you're going to hold that just like that okay now make sure that
the pressure is equal on the left and right and gently just press and hold and
you want to make sure the heads is neutral it's not too far back or forward
and you're just going to hold that gently for about 30 seconds okay what's
going to happen is you're going to reduce a lot of stress in the upper part
of the neck okay and then what you do is you just kind of inch down a little bit
this the next one press in there and you can come down a little bit right here so
we're coming down the neck and we're trying to find the areas of tension and
we're to spend more time right there and we're just going to hold that pressure
now it might be difficult at first for you to do this because it takes a bit of
strength in your hand of course I've been doing it on 40,000 people so my
hands are strong and I can do this all day long but you might want to take a
break or even get my massage tool that is designed around my hand so you can
just lay back on a couch but you want to press in here and just hold press in
here and hold press in here down here and just gonna
hold that for 30 seconds and you're gonna the person's gonna feel really
really relaxed okay and then you would have them do it on you okay let's show
you the next one and so the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to stretch
the mid part of the back right through here so the first thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna take your thumbs or actually just take your your first
finger here curl it and then your thumb like that and hold right here and
stretch the head back okay as far back as you can stretch back all the way
stretch stretch good go forward all the way forward okay and then go back now as
he's going back I'm gonna take the other hand grab underneath the front part and
just pull him back and stretch so I'm pushing this inward while he's
stretching back and I'm gonna inch down to the next segment do it again stretch
just stretch back back back I'm letting him do the stretching over my pivot my
hand right here and I'm going to come down a little bit more come back stretch
stretch stretch and we're just going to hold that for a second go forward and
then come down forward let's do this again stretch stretch stretch back back
all the way here good go forward and then again come back stretch go forward
come down stretch okay good that's as far as you want to go what this is gonna
do it's gonna stretch the mid-back now what's in the mid-back are nerves and
this is the location of the sympathetic nervous system
that's the flight-or-fight you're gonna put the person in such a calm relaxed
mood they're gonna feel like they want to take a nap so the first technique is
the neck the second one is right here and the last one is going to be a simple
stretch where you take your hand and your thumb underneath the skull on the
left side it's called the occiput take the other hand right here and you're
going to lift in lift up and stretch forward so you're
gonna stretch like that and it's a subtle lift and stretch forward okay you
do that about three times on this side and then you come around to the right
side and lift up and forward lift up and over and we're trying to separate this
right here and I'm telling you if so many people have the tension right here
you start stretching this area they're gonna feel so relaxed they're going to
want to take a nap okay good and this is the tool that I designed that mimics my
hand okay so you could use this as well as a Do It Yourself and this would be if
you didn't have someone that could do this technique on you so basically I
designed this to treat myself but I created a more comprehensive video on
acupressure if you haven't seen my stress webinar you definitely want to
check that out I put it right here

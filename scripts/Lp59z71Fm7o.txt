let's talk about why vitamin b6 can potentially help you with your carpal tunnel syndrome
what is carpal tunnel syndrome well you have this little tunnel that goes through your wrist
and there's a nerve called a median nerve and when you get compression of that nerve you have carpal
tunnel syndrome and you can get a pain numbness tingling in the fingertips especially at night
you can find that your grip strength is weaker and the typical treatment is putting you in a splint
doing surgery doing steroids completely unnecessary i did a video a while ago on carpal
tunnel syndrome i'm going to put a link down below of using an acupressure technique extremely
powerful if you have carpal tunnel syndrome you have to check it out and read the comments
because it's like one for one people are doing this and getting rid of their carpal tunnel
syndrome so if you have pain on this side for example you work on the opposite uh forum okay
this part the back part here you massage all through here i show you how to do it i demonstrate
it and you'll be amazed okay but there's also something else you can do take some vitamin b6
in the form of pyridoxal 5-phosphate that is the form of b6 that you want to take i would
recommend 100 milligrams twice a day but if you're deficient in zinc b6 will not work okay so you want
to make sure you take zinc with it roughly about 50 milligrams so many people are deficient in zinc
and that could be the reason why b6 is not working there's a couple little points you want to know
about zinc um if you're getting phytic acid from the grains for example because you're in a high
carb diet you're doing breads and pasta things like that or cereal that could be the reason why
you're deficient in zinc also if you're on a high carb diet you're doing refined grains in general
that refined carbohydrate will deplete zinc also if you have a lot of stress that can deplete zinc
but the reason why vitamin b6 works for carpal tunnel syndrome especially if you have enough zinc
is because it acts as an analgesic it actually increases your pain threshold
so you don't feel the pain but also in addition to the b6 don't forget this massage technique
i put the link right down below check it out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

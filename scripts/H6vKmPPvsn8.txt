now if we look at a virus from the viewpoint of it being our enemy it has
certain strengths and weaknesses right you would never want to attack an enemy
like a virus from its strengths you would want to attack its weaknesses so
what is the strength of a virus its ability to kill the elderly and people
with pre-existing health conditions or to say this more simply to attack
someone with a weakened immune system so what is its weakness it doesn't have
hardly any effect or influence over a healthy people people with a healthy
immune system so your strategy should be strengthening your immune system now yes
changing your diet eating foods high in nutrients are vitally important but what
happens when people are stressed they eat junk food the worst thing you could
do so during a stress state the most important thing to do is to keep in a
good healthy diet now what's very interesting about stress as itself and
I'm talking about worry I'm talking about fear which by the way is threat to
survival no solution all problem overwhelmed by bad news stress fear and
worry spikes a hormone called cortisol cortisol has a very interesting effect
on your immune system now acute stress tends to protect the immune system but
chronic stress actually suppresses your immune system now think about what your
immune system is it's your army it's your defenses against viruses and
pathogens and this is one of the reasons why a lot of viruses come out of
remission when people get stressed because stress tends to push down the
wall and increases the susceptibility to certain pathogens so not only do you
need to keep strengthening your immune system through foods and nutrition and
creating a healthy body but you also need to keep your stress as low as
possible not a lot of people are talking about this but this is a very very
important point if you're watching the news 24/7 bad news stress in your face

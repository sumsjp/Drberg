hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to show you an amazing
technique to relax your head and your neck it's called the cranial relaxation
technique there's three different steps and you're going to need someone to
either do this on you or you to do it on someone else okay so I'm going to have
you practice this and then post your comments below let me show you okay so
this first technique is very very simple you're going to be working something
called sutures there's a suture which is a joint on the skull that comes right
down the front this way okay and you need someone to do this on your body
because it's hard you're going to someone's going to hold your forehead
here or you can hold some more head and you're going to start with your thumb
right here and you're going to press this way so you're going to traction
forward so the skin is going forward and so we have a from back to front effects
starting right here and you're going to hold that pressure forward okay for
about sixty minutes and I'm just kidding and then we're going to inch forward a
little bit forward so we're just going to keep going more forward more forward
more forward the only time that you wouldn't do this is if someone had an
injury to the top of the head that's the next technique I'm going to show you
okay and then the other problem is that you mess up the person's hair so I'm
just going to kind of go forward here and I'm tractioning this way going
forward
what I'm doing is I'm creating a lot of space in the skull
it helps to have big thumbs like I do come this way
okay so we started here and we just inch forward right here so how does your head
feel if I feel the energy moving in it good good so does it feel any more
relaxed yes it does yeah that's that's the point you're going to actually your
whole head is going to feel kind of relaxed because what happens especially
at night is when you try to go to sleep like sometimes there's a lot of tension
in the skull when you do this to release the tension so the first technique is
start here and go inch forward right there okay and the next video we're
going to show you step 2 hey guys welcome back in this video we're going
to talk about maneuver 2 for the cranial sacral relaxation technique this is
really good if someone has an injury to the top of the head let's say they bang
something on the top of the head oh my gosh this would be wonderful and what
you're going to do is you're going to take the skull and you're going to
you're not going to squish it forward you're going to kind of go forward this
way you're going to push the skull together so we're pushing up like this
and we're tractioning around towards the center okay so I'm going to hold that
pressure for about 30 seconds and for video purposes I'm just going to shorten
it so you don't - watch me for 30 seconds and we come again and we come
right into it and if someone if someone has a big head you would do the front
part first and then you would do the middle and the back part right through
here and this does wonders for your hair so I'm actually squeezing and I'm
pulling upward now if you could also when someone has a fall like an injury
to the top of that you could even grab their hair and pull it and traction it
up and some people just it feels really really good so what did that technique
feel it feels light more relaxing feel my
sinuses kind of opening up awesome okay so the first technique was coming down
the center the second is basically taking this goal and pushing it up here
you have a lot of sinuses cavities that are up in the skull through here and
this will help get things moving okay so in the next video we're going to show
you step three okay so in this section what we're going to do is we're going to
work on the articulation between the skull and the neck and there's all these
ligaments that attach in the back of the neck to the skull the back here this
back part of the skull this is called the occiput okay so what we're going to
do is we're going to actually stretch this part okay I like to again hold the
forehead take my thumb and in her hair's down here so be easier to do this on
someone that was bald but anyway I'm going to take my thumb right up
underneath the skull okay and I'm going to lift and flex okay so I'm stretching
it up so I'm taking all those ligaments ligament is bone to bone and I'm
stretching them okay now when I stretch I like to use this part of my thumb just
so it's more comfortable so it's not so sharp okay so I'm going to stretch and
flex like a hold the basketball you're moving like a ball on top of a pivot or
a bowling ball so we're going to come here now I'm going to stretch this two
or three times okay I'm going to make her taller lifting up and this is just
handle just to guide it now I'm going to work my thumb over this way lifting up
and stretching forward pivoting around the center
so I'm really lifting up and I'm going forward okay so I'm working my way
around this little curve here so I did the left side now I'm going to take my
finger middle finger and I'm going to hook the other side up underneath here
and I'm going to lift it and stretch it like this up underneath the skull
stretch it
now I'm going to come a little bit further over here and stretch it right
here the key is getting the angle just right so we're taking the entire back of
the skull which is called the occiput and getting all nice and stretched
okay now how does that feel it feels good it feels relaxing oh yeah if you
did this you would make the person want to take a nap
yeah so that's how you do the cranial relaxation technique alright so that's
how you do it so here's what I want you to do your next step is to practice on
someone you know a family member a friend your spouse and post your

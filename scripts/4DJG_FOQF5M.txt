all right let's talk about good fats and bad fats let's start over here at the bad fats soy
corn canola cotton seed all gmo okay the processing of these oils they use a solvent
called hexane sometimes which is kind of toxic not to mention there could be traces of glyphosate
which is an herbicide but these are severely heated and they're in a lot of foods that we
eat they're definitely in some common foods like mayonnaise okay so if you just go to the grocery
store and you start reading labels you're going to see this one number one or this one right here
mayonnaise salad dressing is another big one right here and even hummus right they don't
even make it with olive oil anymore they have to put these other oils in there so
you just need to start reading labels so these are inflammatory stay away from them of course
margarine that's a given has trans fats crisco for example was on the market for
97 years it might still be on the mark but as far as trans fats go several years ago i think it was
in 2015 the fda finally put a ban on it but then they gave these companies three years to phase out
of these trans fats and so at this point i don't even know who complied who didn't comply but the
fact that trans fats the most deadly fats in our food supply has been on the market for 97 years
is just insane i mean before the trans fats we had things like tallow and lard lard is
pig fat and tallow is beef fat or lamb fat and of course ingrained into our mine you know these are
poison and this is the health food remember the commercial they talked about it's not nice to fool
mother nature i don't even understand what that means because they are fooling mother nature with
margarine the other place that so many people are getting these oils into their body which by the
way are loaded with omega-6 fatty acids and it's just it's just way way out of proportion because
we want to balance the six with the omega-3 fatty acid is in fast food restaurants as well as other
restaurants that are not fast food they put it in there in sauces they definitely use it to
deep fry things and that's what you're getting you're getting a lot of these oils let's just
shift over to these oils right here safflower oil sunflower oil flax oil sesame seed oil which
then turns into this tahini butter and then certain nut oils like peanut oil macadamia nut oil
these are okay for certain people in smaller amounts as long as they're cold pressed
organic would be preferable but if you have too much
even safflower oil or sunflower oil it can be way too too much in omega-6 so
i actually don't even recommend it but in small amounts here and there it's going to be okay
flax soil is very estrogenic the only time i would recommend that is for females that are lacking
estrogen and maybe they need a little boost over a short period of time but definitely not ferment
and then we have sesame seed oil or tahini butter again small amounts make sure it's cold
pressed and you can get raw tahini butter which is actually better than them overly processed and
then of course the nut oils again they're omega-6 so small amounts here and there preferably organic
so this is a no this is occasionally for certain people but let's get to the good fats
cod liver oil is one of the best oils to give you omega-3 fatty acids both dha which your brain
needs and epa which your brain and nervous system need as well as your immune system not to mention
vitamin d and vitamin a and then we have avocado oil that's really good to put on your salad or
you can even cook with it it does have vitamin e if you cook with it the heat is going to kill off
vitamin e okay then we have lard which is considered something that's going
to clog your arteries of course certain cultures certain religions do not consume
lard or anything connected with a pig other people when they think about pig or pig fat
they're thinking about processed pork uh factory farming i'm not talking about that i'm talking
about getting something like wild boar fat which are pigs which are which are bores that have
lived in the open forest in texas and you can get the fat from that it's high in vitamin d3
so ideally you'd want organic pastured lard if you're going to actually get that to cook with or
use in certain recipes but if we were to compare this with this this is like synthetic plastic
and this has been used for a very long time and it doesn't create the oxidation that these type
of fats do it's very stable it's good to cook with then you have kala which is beef fat i would
recommend grass-fed you can get either bison beef or lamb it's great to cook with there's a lot of
vitamins there's a lot of nutrition and it won't irritate your gut problems so either one of these
is good for someone with an autoimmune disease that has a lot of inflammation in the gut camel
fat okay which is some people never heard of that but yes camel camels have fat and you can actually
buy that fat and you can cook with it and you can put it in various recipes it's loaded with b12
it's loaded with the active form of vitamin a it has good amounts of omega-3 fatty acid
it has good amounts of cla which is a healthy type of fat that actually can stimulate your
metabolism then we have butter okay grass-fed i would always recommend if you could find
organic raw that would be the ideal situation but butter has vitamin k2 omega-3 fatty acids and
cla organic ghee from grass-fed cows is also really good to cook with as well
it's clarified which means they get rid of all the solids so you're not going to be exposing
your body to any type of protein particles that you can have an allergy to or the lactose which
is the milk sugar but for the most part you're not going to see much of that in butter but for
some people that are really sensitive they should do ghee and then of course we have
olive oil one of my favorites always get the extra virgin and get it from a real quality source
i order this from this version right here i love this version it's from italy and it's high quality
the farm where they grow this takes great pride in making high quality olive oil and
it's just very very fresh it's like way different than stuff you would get it you know in america at
costco which i don't even know if it's legitimate but this is a seriously high quality product i'll
put a link down below if you want more information about it i don't get any kickbacks but i like to
recommend products that are high quality and then we have palm oil which is very controversial so
the type of palm oil that i would recommend is the eco-friendly environmentally friendly palm oil
that uses certain pharma that doesn't destroy our planet the red palm has some pretty pretty high
level of antioxidants as well as beta carotene and then we have coconut oil okay high in lauric acid
it turns into ketones it'll help ketosis and it's really good to cook with and
of course you'd want to get the coconut oil that's also eco-friendly all right so there
you go there's a quick summary of the good and bad oils and these right here that kind of fit

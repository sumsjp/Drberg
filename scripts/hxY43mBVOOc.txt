now the long-term effect of taking
cortical steroids like prednisone or
some type of cortisol cream
is pretty nasty it's pretty nasty it has
some major side effects
and personally i ended up with poison
ivy pretty much every year in my 20s and
30s and i was forced to take these
cortical steroids and they started
developing all sorts of side effects
till the point where
it didn't work anymore okay and so if i
get poison ivy on my body and it gets to
my face i will look like quasimodo okay
i mean like my whole face just swells up
i remember one time doing a video and i
wore
dark glasses because my eyes were you
couldn't even see my eyes there was just
so much puffiness so it's pretty nasty
so the more prednisone someone ends up
having to take long term
the more
susceptible they are to getting
corticosteroid resistance where
they're in a situation where it just
doesn't work anymore so that's a pretty
bad condition to be in because
what these steroids do is they get rid
of inflammation primarily they actually
shut down the immune system that's how
they do it so people take prednisone
and also cortical steroid injections and
creams for various reasons autoimmune
disorders especially rheumatoid
arthritis especially psoriasis
especially ms lupus and a whole bunch of
other autoimmune diseases
some people with copd chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease take it
definitely asthmatics people with ibs
people with skin conditions if you go to
a dermatologist chances are you're going
to get some type of steroid cream and
also if you have some type of organ
transplant they use these steroids
so
the side effects
cataracts
you get moody okay you can ask my wife i
was very moody waking
i have a very interesting picture which
i'll put up now of me in my 30s when i
was trying to do some rock climbing you
can see i had a pizza crust okay after
taking steroids then you have a
condition called cushing syndrome
right it's a condition where you have
like a a moon face
the gut
you lose your leg muscles and your butt
muscles and i've done videos on the
adrenal body type and that's really
cushing syndrome or aversion of cushing
syndrome
diabetes is a symptom i had a very good
friend who had to take
prednisone for um
a trigeminal neuralgia problem right a
nerve problem and destroyed his life
um osteoporosis is a side effect
but i think the biggest side effect is
this right here immunosuppression
which is the same thing is
immunodeficiency basically you no longer
have the full strength of your innate
immune system okay the immune system is
just
very very weak and it's susceptible to
getting
bacterial infections and viral
infections
and these microbes are opportunistic
okay what does that mean it means they
take advantage of a situation
when your immune system is strong
they don't mess with you because the
barriers are too high but when your
barriers are low and you're more
susceptible and vulnerable to things
then they kind of kick you when you're
down they're pretty evil so this gives
you another side effect of these
cortical steroids which is basically
secondary infections so is there some
solution to this
the answer is yes okay i'm going to give
you a solution
the best thing you can do is start
taking vitamin d3
in higher amounts
like at least 20 000 iu's but preferably
30 or even more international units of
vitamin d3
just make sure you don't take vitamin d2
i'm not going to get into it in this
video i'll have to do a a special video
just on d2 but you want d3
very very important especially what it
does to the vitamin d receptor so
vitamin d
is really not
a
vitamin it is a natural over-the-counter
steroid okay
it is like a healthy version of
prednisone okay
without the side effects so this is
really important and you'll probably do
very well from this alone but there's
other things i'm going to recommend like
plant steroids so there are natural
corticosteroids okay in plants
now steroids are kind of a
category of a lot of different things
you have like steroid hormones like
estrogen progesterone testosterone
things like that the plant steroids that
i'm going to recommend for you
are going to be the ones that mimic the
corticosteroids
the ones that are primarily going to
affect inflammation one's called false
unicorn root okay that's a chinese herb
next one is licorice root
okay and then
fenugreek okay these are three good
plant steroids that can create different
effects on the body like this one right
here is really good for skin conditions
like psoriasis right licorice root is a
really good anti-inflammatory
all over including histamines it's kind
of like a natural histamine and then
fenugreek is really good for lung
inflammation and other types of
inflammation as well there's a lot of
anti-inflammatory properties in
different plants like turmeric and
garlic
and thyme and things like that but the
anti-inflammatories i'm going to
recommend are basically plant
steroids okay number three you want to
get a good adrenal glandular extract
product it's going to be bovine from a
cow
i would recommend getting the grass-fed
version and also freeze dried
why
because when i was in practice i would
always use the adrenal glandulars to
help people with
inflammatory conditions helping them
come off steroids in this transition
step it just supports the key gland that
makes these steroids which is the
adrenal gland so this is essential and
then number four and this is interesting
tatka is a synthetic bile product that
can do a lot of things but it's a very
powerful anti-inflammatory
now you could also use other purified
biosalts too if this is not available
it will work but now why would tutka
help this condition because
bile salts have the ability
to activate
the vitamin d receptor so if there is a
problem
with
the vitamin d receptor for various
reasons whether it's genetics
or another common reason
bacteria in your body and viruses have a
certain strategy that they can block the
vitamin d receptor in your body so it
shuts down your immune system so they
can actually you know do whatever they
want in your body
so it just so happens that you can use a
bile salt to open up the vitamin d
receptor and trigger that cascade of
effects that occur within the immune
system that's supposed to be occurring
from vitamin d but if it's blocked you
can use this too and i'll tell you where
i got this information from there's a
it's called the marshall protocol
this dr marshall came up with a protocol
that uses
a combination of antibiotics
long term which i don't like that option
and benecar which is a high blood
pressure medication
to treat autoimmune diseases now
benicara is a unique drug in that it can
also
open up the vitamin d receptor okay it
can mimic vitamin d even though it's not
vitamin d but the problem is there's
side effects from high blood pressure
medication and also you need a
prescription okay
taka and other purify bile salts you
don't need a prescription so if you were
going to do some research on this you
would have to know
the terminology to search for it would
be the vdr analog the vitamin d receptor
analog which is basically something that
mimics something so this would mimic
vitamin d all right so now that you have
a good alternative
cortical steroids
i think the next most important video
for you to watch would be the one on
vitamin d so check out this video in
relationship to inflammation i put it up
right here

so we all know that the gallbladder is not necessary
it's an extra organ it's not needed it doesn't do much
it's very similar to the appendix just causes pain bloating
in stones right well i severely disagree with that if you go
on google and you type this in there you will see probably the first
five to ten pages of websites and webmd and the authorities that will say
that hey you don't need a gallbladder it's okay to remove it
but let's just take a look at this for a minute what does the gallbladder
do it stores bile what's the significance
of concentrated bile well there's something called a bile
cholesterol ratio if there's low bile
to the amount of cholesterol in the liver or the gallbladder
you develop stones gallstones or liver stones
so bile helps keep that cholesterol from forming
stones and clogging things up because if the bile gets clogged up in the liver it
creates inflammation fibrosis and eventually
scar tissue and cirrhosis so bile is a detergent it makes the fat more
water soluble it makes the fat more absorbable into your small intestines
by removing the gallbladder you'll still make
bile it'll still trickle through to the small intestines
but it's going to be a lot less concentrated
and it's going to be a lot less regulated because now we just have a
tube and we don't have a certain amount of
bile being squeezed into the small intestine so you
can use that to help break down fats and extract certain nutrients from
the fat all the fat soluble vitamins vitamin a d
e k 1 and k 2 are completely dependent on bile for their absorption
so if you start losing your bile you're going to start losing eventually
vitamin a so that can affect your vision and by
the way bile directly can activate the vitamin a
receptor and there is a connection between lowered bile pools in your body
and your vision bile helps you absorb vitamin d
and because the majority of people are deficient in vitamin d we should also be
looking at this bile connection so bile doesn't just help you break down
fat and extract vitamin d but bile can stimulate the receptors for
vitamin d directly and help vitamin d work a lot better in
the body as well as convert inactive vitamin d to active vitamin d
and then we have vitamin e which is essential for your muscles
for your heart for sex hormones so without enough concentrated bile
you may not absorb all the fat cycle vitamins and it could take a while for
that to show up as deficiencies okay number two
constipation bile acts as a lubricant to allow food to go through your body so
without enough bile you'll tend to have constipation number
three bile helps you extract omega-3 fatty
acids from the food that you eat specifically
dha and epa this is a very powerful
anti-inflammatory and this is very very important in your
brain and your retina number four i already
mentioned this vitamin d and vitamin a receptors are
activated by by bile so if you don't have enough bile
you may not get the full function of vitamin d and vitamin a
number five and a lot of people don't realize this i just recently created a
video on it bile keeps bacteria out of the wrong
place in other words it keeps bacteria
friendly and unfriendly out of your small intestines this is why
you have roughly over 20 feet of small intestine
and at the very end of that tube it's called the ilium
it's the last part right before it connects to the large intestine
that's where you absorb 95 of all your bile
because the body wants to have bile go all the way through
small intestine and act as an antibacterial
and keep that out of the small intestine that way you can avoid getting sibo
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in that condition it robs all your
nutrients and it creates all sorts of bloating issues
all right number six biles necessary for the conversion of t4 to t3
so to keep your thyroid working you need bile number seven bile regulates
cholesterol it will get rid of the excess amount of cholesterol it doesn't
need so it helps to purge and regulate excess
cholesterol as well as the detoxification of certain drugs and
access hormones and number eight if someone's deficient in bile one of
the side effects is ulcers and gastritis
because the bile sometimes gets backed up into the wrong place and it can
irritate the tissues now there's two fascinating books that
i'm basing this off of one is bile acid biology and it's therapeutic
implications and my favorite bile salts in health and
diseases these are textbooks on bile salts
and the amount of data you can get from this is fascinating
so unfortunately it's there seems to be a big disconnect or
lack of knowledge about exactly what the gallbladder does
and specifically what bile does all right i'll see you in the next video

now there's many things that can cause a migraine headache and i've done a lot of
videos on this i'll put some links down below if you have migraines don't forget
ketones ketones can greatly help your brain in many ways there was a study in 1930 that
demonstrated that 28 of migraine sufferers reported no migraines after being on keto and
an additional 25 percent reported less frequency of migraines and i couldn't get the details of
what type of keto they did back in the 30s but now it could have been dirty keto or a healthy keto i
don't know but the fact that it produced that much change means there's something to it now
migraines have been a mystery for a very long time but recent evidence suggests that it stems from
cerebral energy deficiency so there's an energy problem in the cerebral hemispheres of your brain
and so part of your brain just doesn't get energy which does also relate to insulin
resistance and that could be one of the reasons why ketones is effective because
ketones provide an alternative fuel to the brain the other factor that contributes to a migraine
is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have
now as far as how that relates to a ketone ketones can act like an antioxidant so it not
only protects you against free radical damage it can also act as an anti-inflammatory so your brain
loves ketones for many reasons it actually prefers ketones over glucose it can improve your mood your
cognitive function that means improve your memory your focus and your concentration and there's a
lot of research on how it can improve epilepsy and increase mitochondrial function which has to
do with this energy thing right here and lastly it reduces oxidative stress it produces less
waste products as it's being burned as fuel so if you have migraines don't forget getting on
the ketogenic diet in fact it might be beneficial to do mct oil and even exogenous ketones to boost
up your ketones even more but in order to supply the brain with ketones you need to go low carb
if you're new to my channel i put a link down below of exactly how to do that
and also very importantly you can't be snacking through the day you want to eliminate the snacks
you want to do intermittent fasting these two are essential when you're dealing with migraine
headaches give it a shot and comment down below before you go if you have a question about a

hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the biggest indicator
for pre-diabetes right so in a pre-diabetic State you have either hypoglycemia or you have insulin
resistance okay and then it turns into diabetes but the biggest indicator or clue to know that
you have this is not being satisfied after you eat so you have a meal and you're not full you either
keep eating or you need a little bit of something sweet okay and that is because in a cell that has
instant resistance the fuel is blocked it's not allowed to go into the cell so the cell
is starving of fuel and certain nutrients okay and a normal cell it goes right in easily but insulin
resistance that cell starves and then it sends a signal back to the pancreas telling the pancreas
to produce more insulin so this situation has a situation when you have five to seven times more
insulin now here's the thing it takes ten years in some people of having this condition before you
become a diabetic and so you when you go get your blood tested it might show normal for many many
years until even develops a situation like that so the best test would be more of an a1c which is an
average of blood sugars for three months or even better yet a fasting insulin test not a glucose
test but even then it's going to have to be pretty advanced before even that shows up so you can even
check your insulin levels or a1c and it could be low but you could still have the situation
because it's not advanced yet so this is kind of like a subclinical because it doesn't start you
don't get diabetes overnight it's gradual slowly it gets worse and worse until finally you have it
but it could take ten years on this so what you need to realize is that the cells are starving a
bit and you're not and it takes a while for it to be absorbed so instead of adding more sweet
or more food you should add a different type of food which is more fat because fat will not
dramatically increase insulin okay so it kind of almost like a neutral situation so adding more fat
will make you feel satisfied giving you the need to not be hungry and not eat the wrong foods and
then over time you'll heal the situations because we want to have a period of time between meals
where you're not snacking so we can heal this and we can't just keep eating all the time so number
one if you have if you're not satisfied after a meal just realize what's happening add a little
more fat with the meals and give it some time sometimes it takes between one to two weeks of
doing this before you start absorbing the fuel and being satisfied so don't think it's going
to happen overnight okay all right so put your comments below and I'll see in the next video

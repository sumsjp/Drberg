the secret to diabetes is hidden in the definition now if you have diabetes and
you do your own research you're going to be completely and utterly confused
because if you look up the definition of diabetes it will say that it's hyperglycemia which is high
blood sugar which is affecting the large vessels especially in the heart this can affect the tiny
blood vessels of the eye and the kidney and also it's going to affect your nerves as in creating
damage in the peripheral nerves the nerves at the bottom of the feet and the hands so your
fingers will get numb and pain and sometimes a burning sensation now if we look at the causation
of insulin it will talk about a lack of insulin or a decrease in insulin since insulin is the hormone
that controls the blood sugars so if we don't have the hormonal controls of the lowering blood sugar
and that's not there blood sugar starts going higher and higher and you're diabetic
now take a look at what controls insulin the pancreas so the pancreas through its beta cells
make insulin the insulin goes through the blood it connects to certain receptors to create a function
of lowering the blood sugar and so what's going to cause a lack of insulin is either the lack of
production of insulin or on the other side here a blocked receptor so the receptor for insulin
becomes resistive as in insulin resistance okay so either we have insulin resistance or we have
a pancreas that's not able to produce insulin but in guyana's physiology and other medical textbooks
you see this little clue here as the first thing that happens when you start to have
diabetes is you have what's called compensatory hyperinsulinemia now what is that that means
that when the cells start resisting insulin the pancreas will compensate by making more
insulin so we still have the function of lowering blood sugar to a certain degree and so we have
insulin resistance so the pancreas is going to compensate by making more insulin okay so that's
it's compensating okay and then what happens after a period of time the second thing that happens is
you no longer are able to compensate because the beta cells are now dysfunctional they're exhausted
they're overwhelmed and they stop working and so when this starts to go down
the blood sugars start to go higher and higher and higher so the real big question to figure this out
is what's causing the initial hyper insulin situation what is causing this
increase in insulin well for that we have to look up hyperinsulinemia which is very
interesting because if we look at wikipedia and what causes high insulin it says neoplasm which
is a tumor carb malabsorption okay pancreatic cancer pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome
and trans fats it also goes on to say results from a variety of diseases we're talking about these
as well as sugar in the diet now that's like red at the very very end and there's no real
emphasis of this and it's really nowhere else in this whole page and so if you're new at this
and you're just reading this and you don't know the massive connection between consuming sugar
and diabetes you might focus more on these things right here wow maybe i have cancer
maybe i have pcos and focus on something that is so rare that you're going to miss this right here
i mean if you knew to grab maybe a physiology book like guys physiology and look up insulin but you
probably never do that but if you did you'd find all sorts of information on what triggers insulin
the big one is carbohydrates so in order to control this you must lower the carbs in the diet
but you might be confused if you read this book right here merck's manual under the chapter of
diabetes because it's talking about the diet for diabetes it says this diet composition there is no
need to disproportionately restrict the intake of carbohydrates in the diet of most diabetics what
that is absolutely bad advice because what they're going to recommend is you just manage it with
metformin and if you consume more carbohydrates just increase your medication to adjust for that
now there's some other additional things on this page that were very interesting to me
they're talking about mice studies they mentioned that a high fat diet has a causative role
in hyperinsulinemia now if you're an average person you're reading this you're going to go
wow i need to start cutting my fat out of my diet and the problem with even reading the study is
you're not going to even find the complete study you're going to have to buy the study online
so if you were to buy the study online and download it and then find out what they actually
fed the mice what do they consider a high-fat diet which i've actually done this i've ordered a study
and i've researched what they feed these mice you're going to find that this is
not just a high-fat diet this is a high fat slash high carbohydrate diet now we have a
little piece of omitted information that could be devastating if you're operating off of this false
information because if you combine carbs with fat or carbs with protein versus just consuming carbs
alone you're going to have a much greater impact or spike in insulin when you combine a high fat
and high carb diet so no wonder this high fat diet is a causative factor in creating high levels of
insulin okay so then you get down to the bottom of the page and it talks about the treatment
diet exercise metformin they also mention consuming cinnamon like in cinnamon and sugar
on your toast right and so when you look further on the page specifically this what they're talking
about with this diet you're talking about lowering simple carbohydrates okay not actually eliminating
simple carbohydrates like sugar but lowering them and replacing them with whole grains
okay now they didn't even mention consuming vegetables they're talking about adding grains
if you have too much insulin it's the carbohydrates that increase insulin more than
anything else and whole grains are carbohydrates in the next sentence they say reduce potatoes
so they don't tell you to eliminate potatoes just reduce them again a potato is a carbohydrate
why are you even talking about a potato you should be eliminating all carbs or at least bringing
them down significantly and then they actually add a sentence in there that says you need to
increase your legumes especially soy they didn't mention anything about any other beans or anything
they just made a point about consuming soy so i looked up to study and what they were
talking about and of course this study was a questionnaire study very very scientific right
where there's a million variables you have people that smoke you have people that eat a
random thing and how are you going to isolate that it was the soy that reduced the insulin levels in
your blood you can't so obviously this was put in here with some slight bias as well as this
one right here and so this is why i do videos to help put attention on the important stuff so you
don't have to get lost in the sea of confusion in the area of health thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the
people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

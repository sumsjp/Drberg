hi guys today we're gonna talk about why sperm count is downtrending 1973 to
2011 it crashed down by 60% okay now why is that it's pretty mysterious what is
behind that because it's very difficult to tell you exactly but there are
several factors that definitely have a huge impact on lowering testosterone in
reducing sperm count and sperm motility okay number one phthalates okay this
comes from plastic using too many plastic containers water bottles also
microwaving things in plastic containers are really really bad there's
so much plastic around us everywhere you go the foods in plastic that plastic is
bio accumulative it can build up in the tissues it's anti androgenic and it has
significant impact on lowering your sperm counts and your testosterone all
right estrogen if a guy has too much estrogen that is going to lower
testosterone and a sperm count now the fatter someone is the more
estrogen they're going to make because fat through the help of this enzyme
turns testosterone into estrogen also the exposure to estrogen from chemicals
and environment can mimic estrogen it's called endocrine disruptors it's like
the pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides that's why it's highly
recommended that you do Organic number three insulin resistance okay high
levels of insulin which occur when you have instant resistance will lower your
testosterone this probably is a really big cause right here with this one right
here because this is been getting worse from the 70s to right here if you're on
statins to lower your cholesterol that could be another reason why because
testosterone is a sex hormone made from cholesterol so if you block your
cholesterol production guess what you block the influence over your testicles
alright number five GMO foods there's huge connection between glyphosate which
is the roundup-ready chemical and lowering
sperm counts I put a study down below you can check it out this is why it's
vital to start doing organic foods and then soy soy since so many different
foods soy protein isolates it's in so called
keto friendly bars it's in a lot of diet shakes it's a lot of different foods
especially if someone is a vegetarian or a vegan and they're doing a substitute
type meat soy has been directly associated with lowering sperm count I
put some links down below now if you haven't seen my video on testosterone I
put it up right here check it out

so today we're going to talk about arch supports and how they can actually
make someone's flat feet worse now growing up i had flat feet
really bad and for years i tried every single arch support custom
orthotics you name it and reflecting back on the
actual cause of flat feet my theory is that it's either a
manganese deficiency at birth or a vitamin d deficiency that
sets up a child with either a weakened structure of the arch
or a bone malformation i had constant problems with my feet
through sports track and field wrestling and even the army
i really never felt a lot of relief when i would have this arch support
they take a mold of your flat foot and then they customize
a an orthotic that matches the fallen arch
all i know is it didn't work for me as i was constantly massaging that arch to
try to get some relief i think it was like i was 22
years old where i went to someone that did foot
massage and oh my goodness did i get some relief
with that but they actually really worked the
muscles on the front part of the shin which was
extremely painful but when they were done it was like i
was walking on air at that point i stopped wearing the
arches and my feet start feeling better and i
would start to massage the foot as well and then a few years later i started
doing stretches not the usual stretches of the calf
but i stretch the other part of the leg where you take your toes and you stretch
them down which i will demonstrate in a
minute looking back at what i did i didn't really understand at the time
but all i knew is when i stretched the front part of the leg
it gave way more relief than stretching the calf so if the bottom of the arch or
the bottom of the foot is cramping and you stretch the muscles
on the top part of the foot that stem right up into the front part
of the leg you will send signals to the muscle
that's cramping that will relax the muscle so that's how
it works so you don't want to ever stretch the
the tight muscle you want to work on the opposite side
so i'm going to demonstrate that right now check out this little part of this
video so take the toes and we're just going to
stretch them like this we're going to stretch and stretch
about 10 times and we're actually stretching this whole muscle right
through in here what that will do that will give the
foot the signals are sent to relax the bottom
of the foot it'll really give you a lot of relief okay so we're going to
stretch that okay so that would be the stretch of
what you would want to do if you had fallen arches
it will give you a lot of relief you just do it every single day
second thing i would recommend finding someone that specializes in
a foot massage and have them work not just on the foot
but on the front part of the lower leg you will get
so much relief and number three take those arches out and allow your
feet to strengthen on their own you're going to find that without that
little handicap the little arch that the muscles in the lower part of
the leg will adapt and they'll become stronger and they'll start holding
somewhat of an arch there and you will get way more relief

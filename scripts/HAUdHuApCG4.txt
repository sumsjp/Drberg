there's an interesting relationship between cortisol and vitamin d that i'm going to talk
about today or i could also say there's an interesting relationship between stress and
vitamin d as well so the first question is this is it the vitamin d that causes low cortisol or
is it the cortisol either too high or too low that causes a vitamin d deficiency is it the chicken
or the egg well i think it's the chicken and the egg because vitamin d is required to make adrenal
hormones not just the adrenal hormone cortisol but other adrenal hormones as well and so if a
person is deficient in vitamin d which includes the majority of the population because most
people have a vitamin d deficiency then they're also going to be deficient in certain adrenal
hormones which can then set them up for all sorts of problems not having enough adrenal support
to counter stress in life i mean the adrenal hormones are all about adapting your physiology
to the environment related to stress and if you're not adapting to stress you can have a
lot of problems and this is why there are so many diseases that are caused by stress ulcers diabetes
increased risk for cancer autoimmune disease heart conditions infection there are so many people that
end up with an infection both viral and bacterial which occurs right after a stress event because
the stress lowers the immune system and makes you very susceptible to getting an infection then you
have insomnia sleep apnea it can affect your mood put you in a state of anxiety or depression and it
can make you gain weight because cortisol affects the blood sugars and then we have another aspect
of this vitamin d and cortisol are both powerful anti-inflammatories and so how many conditions
out there are involved with inflammation i mean just about every single chronic health problem
has an inflammatory factor to it and then we have another situation where we have high cortisol
cushing's syndrome and low cortisol addison's both related to a vitamin d deficiency now if we also
look at the immune system okay cortisol normally suppresses the white blood cells and vitamin d
modulates the immune system which means it helps control it so if there is an overactive
immune system whether you have allergies hypersensitivities or even something severe
like a cytokine storm and vitamin d can come in there and help suppress the over reaction
of the immune system and related to that vitamin d has a very important purpose of helping to prevent
autoimmune diseases so does cortisol because if there's a problem with cortisol that can
set you up for a susceptibility to developing an autoimmune disease as well and then we have the
raw material that actually makes cortisol and vitamin d comes from the same thing cholesterol
and so if you are on a statin drug or you're told to go on a low-fat diet
and you don't have enough cholesterol to make both vitamin d and cortisol and on top of that
bile bile is made from cholesterol as well so if you don't have the raw material to
make these you can imagine what could happen to your immune system inflammation etc etc etc
and so this cortisol and vitamin d relationship is very interesting any condition that involves
cortisol either too much or too little i highly recommend you take vitamin d
to help to normalize cortisol because that will actually enhance it in fact i like looking at
vitamin d as a natural prednisone without the side effects in recent videos i talked about
the 10th cause of a vitamin d deficiency which is polymorphism which is kind of a defect in the
vitamin d receptor and you can watch that video i'll put it down below but i listed all the
different causes of a vitamin d deficiency and i added number 11 which is stress so the more
stress you go through the more vitamin d you're going to be deficient and so the bottom line is
stress causes a vitamin d deficiency and a vitamin d deficiency can also make you more stress
and create a cortisol problem all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

so so happy we had a chance to connect
up because i just got an email
about what you're doing and i was like
wow this is amazing i have to meet you
and
see what you're up to
so you're actually one of one of my keto
coaches right
yes yes of course it's my pleasure and
this is my uh this is my certificate
wow that's great
and so you are located in a couple
places right i think
in the middle east uh two different i
think two different countries right
i am located in jordan
okay
yes okay
wow and you have quite a large youtube
channel you're helping so many people
wow
yes i have a youtube channel that is uh
any all
all the topics that that in it include
it's focused on low carbohydrate dates
life style it's samara's keto life
that is so amazing and i see there's a
really cool book behind you i see that i
like that it's called
the um
keto and
i can see that actually
yeah the body type okay the type
that's great
looks very familiar
so so ted tell me a little bit about how
you found out about uh
keto and my program and just in general
did you have any you had health problems
or
any other issues or
at first and most of the people will
will will have some problems including
insulin resistance in their life they
are eating carbohydrates
i've begun keto five years from now
at that time i was a structural engineer
and the trainer in the jordanian
[Music]
training center for engineers
and
i've begin with the stress of life begin
to gain weight
especially in the central obesity
so
and i begin to search about diets and
trying to lower my correct intake in
order to
lose that excess weight and even though
i was a cyclist and i jogging i ha i
practice jogging and running
it doesn't
help me to lose that weight uh
accidentally at that that
period of time i've stood and i've
saw a strange topic
in the youtube
if you want to lose weight
if you want to lose fat eat fat
a strange topic
at that time five years ago in the
middle east there's no one know about
the ketogenic diet it was in the united
states booming in the united states but
not in the middle east
so
[Music]
i've listened to the video watched the
video from the end from the beginning to
the end
after i finished it i decided to begin
with the ketogenic diet the day after it
wow so
immediately
it clicked my mind
so
i began with the keto flu issue the
constipation by changing the
fiber and the meals so i begin to search
on youtube and end up with
uh what is keto where what's accepted
and what is not
and of course and i've
watched your videos and began they
become addicted to your videos
wow that's awesome thank you
fine thanks
so so you basically um
you had this stomach area and you just
you search it out and being an engineer
you probably want to know all about the
details you want to know why it works
and it just makes sense to you because
you think
you think logically cause and effect
unlike the medical profession sometimes
they don't really think like an engineer
ah
of course any when i was in engineering
schools whatever in engineering school
whatever we we have learned
we begin by learning the cause
what is the the the derivation of the
equation how does the equation
ends
and after we know the the the
experimentation the explanation and the
derivation we begin with the with the
science
in medical is too cool in nutrition
because i i've quit my job at the end
and studied nutrition
there's
no
when you are studying the
the literature you are not studying the
the the roots of the literature
you are all what you are studying at the
end is the recommendation for the rda or
the recommendation for the experts so in
with the topic of cholesterol
we've studied all
from the first year in nutrition to the
final to the end
cholesterol is bad low saturated fats
where's the clue where's the research
we have not we have never been
exploded
studied the research
even the the ketone bodies and how how
does it work
we've never studied and the doctors who
never any
opened this topic in a good way
while it is in the literature in in the
textbook you can study the the ketogenic
in the biochemistry it's in the the book
but it is not in the syllabus
you're right you're right totally it's
not there and so um
you give someone who doesn't understand
these basic
words these basic principles
and
it doesn't make sense to them but when
they think keto they think um keto
acidosis diabetes that's as far as it
goes now it's dangerous stay away from
it because
the word is similar but but so it's like
you really have to understand the uh
like you said the basics and the root uh
uh that's why i have um
lots of dictionaries because when you go
into this medical literature you
there's probably going to be about at
least 20 words per paragraph you have to
look them up uh especially when you get
into um
the biochemistry
and if you try to study that without
doing that you're
you're basically going to be fully
asleep by the time you get through with
it um
because
some of these words are just like so
long and so um
when we get into so what i do is i try
to simplify i try to you know take these
complex try to make it as simple as
possible
and i my favorite dictionary actually is
a chinese dictionary chinese to english
dictionary because
um
the definitions are really simple
um because some of the other definitions
other other dictionaries i have
you know you end up seeing all these
words that i don't even know what they
mean in the definition so i have to look
those up and it takes me forever so i'm
really um
uh into using dictionaries and
really understanding the full meaning of
what the subject is talking about and
every little part of it so
yeah and i see you have a skeleton right
next to you
uh
this one i i bought when i began to to
study a
personal trainer for for sports so i
began to study the bones and the muscles
in order to understand
great so
great
and so um you have um
i'm gonna put your youtube channel below
the link down below so people can sign
up um but you know what's fascinating in
the middle east which
uh that's actually
the majority
it's even more than my english channel
the um
arabic language the
northern africa the whole middle east
there's a huge interest in the
quito and i
i'm assuming it's because they eat more
sugar than any other country in the
world or more and that as far as the
area goes
i think it's it's
it's way more than america and i when i
was when i looked at that i'm like
there's a lot of sweet things that you
guys eat over there
oh there's a lot of in something of the
that which is difficult in the middle
east that
the culture and the
the type of
food that we eat it's so delicious
delicious by design it's it's it it
causes you to to eat more even and if
you if you see a tourist who is coming
from united states and he is doing keto
he cannot continue he will cheat in the
middle east
yeah you have all that dessert that is
and
that is becoming after immediately after
lunch or dinner
uh
bombed with sugars
and in the middle east older at least
the main food that we eat is rice
and even sometimes rice with bread
in in in jordan we have
a meal that is mansur
it's it's a bread after on it is a lot
of rice with a lot of meat so the
insulin will will dry rise to the
rocket like a rocket i'm sure that uh
you may even need a nap after lunch
if you do that
of course of course
and it's it's it's it's difficult to
have an app after a big million and uh i
mean a lot of people has a insulin
resistance you can see it everywhere so
uh
and
your your channel is very popular in the
middle east it's one it's the bit
the number one uh channel that that is
uh watched in the middle east it's your
your channel wow wow that's good because
you know what i think it's going to help
a lot of people there and there it looks
like they're interested and they'll
change their diet and i think um
be healthier for it and we're getting a
lot of success stories over there as
well so
um
yeah that's great i'm so glad that
people like you are
taking responsibility for the different
areas because we need a lot more people
to help because
there's a lot of people out there that
need coaching and need help and more
data
so that's so great that you're doing
this
of course
where
there's some something that uh that is
interesting in your book and your
point of view of losing weight it's the
it's not close way to be healthy
it's be healthy to lose weight
right yeah
right
it's the best the best concept that can
be that can describe how to lose weight
you know it's one of those simple things
that's so powerful when you really get
it
and i stumbled on it
by accident because with the patient
started working with someone and
the first month she didn't lose any
weight and i was really frustrated i was
ready to quit and she's like no no i'm
feeling good look at my skin is better
and i have more energy and i say are you
sure
lost zero weight for the first month i
mean she did everything i told her
in the second month she lost more weight
the third month it was the second way
second month i think she lost 21 pounds
the third month was like 63 pounds
so i just had this light bulb go off i
said you know what
you have to get healthy first before you
lose weight
and that has really helped um
with a lot of people because if you
don't have that viewpoint
and you um
go for the weight loss and it doesn't
work
you'll quit
even though it's working you're getting
healthy so
it it just resonates with people because
it's the truth and
especially women
that are have a slow metabolism if
they're trying to lose weight um
they might not at first but the energy
goes up i think with keto
and with all the things related to
health probably the biggest
indicator to know that it's working is
the cravings go away the cravings go
away you're not hungry that is the first
thing to know it's working
and don't change anything
and then of course then your stomach
will start shrinking you have more
energy
uh cognitive improvements but it's uh
i like it because it's simple and it's i
found things that are simple are very
powerful um
and so
that's why i i just want to get as many
people on this as possible because it
handles
not just weight as you know it handles
so many other issues
oh of course any uh
any
in my practice in coaching people
uh
as you you have said in in
new lectures in the the coaching program
it's so powerful that even some
something some problems in the client's
situation
is solving without any medical
intervention
while he is
he can comes to you to lose weight
but
his insulin resistance dropped down
diabetes
dropped down
[Music]
hypertension is normalized
skin tags they they also lose their
things uh
skin tags uh
emotional emotions
begin to be clear more more clearly they
get rid of hunger and the cravings
when they they begin with me
and
asked me
for how long does
do i need to go with keto
so i answered them as you tell us
at first let's reach our target and then
you will you will decide for how long
you have been to keto when i started
keto and myself i i did not begin quito
in order to
to make this diet my life my life style
diet
i begin beginning
to experiment with the diet
i have seen it in youtube
without a recommendation from from
anybody the
opposite of everything i have learned
from media at that point
and i began to to
to to measure my blood pressure because
i had high blood pressure issues at that
time so i i was scared that it might
increase my blood pressure because i
will eat fat
opposite of the recommendation for
hypertension to have low sword low fat
diet
so
my hypertension my blood pressure drops
down
i i began to have to have clarity
my performance in exercising is is
better
it's i i
i describe the
the the happiness of keto and intimate
fasting
it's the happiness or or the joinment
of empty stomach
i like that
yes to feel that you have all that
energy
in your body all that focus
at the same time you don't have any
bloating
to disconnect between
the the
the feel of uh
any
satiety
and a bloating stomach
most of people connect
this the the satiety
with the bloating and uh
and an explosion in his gut and he has
to you know the the
the the food that should be like like
here in order to feel uh so tight any
isn't that true you have to keep
stuffing yourself to the point where
okay
okay uh now i'm thoughtful so now it's
it's it's weird it's like we have to um
we have to cram as much food but when
you actually
start doing intermittent fasting and you
start to find out um
how much better you can feel
being
truly um
burning fat and switching over to fat
burning and you're no longer dependent
on these
blood sugar things boy
it's kind of like um that's where i'm
trying to put people i'm trying to get
people in that place so
they from their own accord from their
own self can determine that that's the
that that's workable versus
especially when you get into diet you
got to be careful when you evaluate
people and you
they have so many losses they have so
many
bad programs people tell them so i use a
very very light touch when i coach
people
try this out see if this works for you
i want them
to really make up their own mind to do
it rather than me pushing them to do it
all the time
that doesn't work so once they feel it
and understand it
you don't have to use
motivational
tricks and tips and
gimmicks they just do it because they
feel better you know it's like wow this
this makes sense so uh
i just learned that from trial and error
yes of course any a a a human is like no
it's not like an ant no and an ant can
can can
keep trying to to climb a rock
and keep trying
a human try one
second third time three times and quit
forget the the the
beautiful thing about ketu
it's like
when you begin with it you each each uh
symptom or or good experience we are
talking about in social media he will
experience it
and
and this experience of changing his life
his diet
uh
make the the person like um
wants to know what's coming next any
he's he's he's experimenting in his body
uh he he he's he's feeling well and so
so so on
the that's what we mean at the the the
last five years i i have been
experimenting all all of thing in keto
under carbohydrate date i tried to fast
for three days
and experiment experiment for and
measure my ketone bodies and glucose and
glucose each uh every two hours
wow okay
so in order to grow to graph the gki the
glucose ketone index
and after that at the third day i i
tried to
to to make an exercise to our exercise
cycling exercise to to so to see how
much glucose will reduce or
and ketone increase
so at that time i reached 5.6 millimole
for this liter yeah wow
that's some serious ketones
that's amazing
there's some something
in newly i i put it in your group in the
coaching groups
uh i've measured my my son's ketones
uh he's an infant or not infant he's six
month years old six months okay so
in in literature when you see in the
when you read about the nutrition form
for babies and you see the breast milk
the breast milk is 55 fat
right
and
six percent protein which is about two
per two grams per kilogram for for the
for the baby
and 40 grams of lactose and like the
lactose is low glycemic it's not like
fructose or not like glucose
so by by design the baby will be in
ketosis
so when before introducing food solid
food to our baby i told my wife i i want
to measure my baby's ketones so
do it and and he was 0.6 after uh
after after me after a blessed a will
breastfed
um
that is fantastic yeah i have a
granddaughter she's uh two years old
right now and so totally on keto uh you
talk about
coordination
about
um advanced intelligence about perfect
bone structure
i mean it's it's the right diet for kids
as well and
you shouldn't you shouldn't have to load
up kids with all these carbs um you just
end up
unfortunately causing all sorts of
you know atd issues focus issues um lucy
is her name and she's very calm she's
focused um in control of her own body
she'll go up the stairs and if she falls
she catches herself i'm like
keto is the way to go so um and breast
she's
breastfed for a long time so that was
very very important too you know
breastfeeding is very important and you
can see that that if you rise the baby
in a low carbohydrate diet
uh even even when he sees
scandi's he will not enjoy candy as
other boys and girls any
he he can he will take it in some point
but
it will not uh
he he will still like
like avogadro's
broccoli vegetables meat
it will not take the place of this whole
foods
do you have any other kids
i have three three kids i have
[Music]
said shaham
but
the cause of introducing ketogenic diet
for my family
was my smallest my
middle son
which would
he was the the turning point in my key
to journey
because
uh i was keto and i was losing weight
and
my wife continues uh cooking by rice and
bread and like this and i only eat the
the something that that can be eaten
from for a ketogenic day
so
when he was one one and eight
one year and eight months
our physician told told us that he is
not growing any his length height is not
increasing
so
i told her what to do at the aft mini
see she told me after
after he reached two years
she will begin with the with testing the
growth hormone
so
so i asked her what what can i do in
order to increase growth hormone and i
at that point i already
watched all most of your videos for so
fasting and and ketogenic diet will
increase it but i cannot do this
this thing with my
young son
so she told me you can reduce
carbohydrate
but not
eliminated huh so
when i uh
at that point i told her i will put him
in a ketogenic diet so she told me no no
no don't put him in any questions
at the car when we're driving so my wife
is crying you want to put him in the
diet that you are you are freaking out
so
uh after her read first you will cook i
will not cook for him so you have to to
to make the decision
read for for one week and after that we
will show
we will take the decision if you want
uh after one week we begin all the
family
me and my family my my
my wife and
both of our sons in the ketogenic state
and at that month he
grows his growth began
and increased two centimeters
wow
i don't know if
i don't know for now
does he has some gluten
gluten intolerance
which
may make the growth stop or stole or or
or it's it's normal but i i've tried to
make this thing and it works
that is fantastic you know um
in my pr when i was in practice 30 years
i was in practice for 30 years
uh and the second i guess the
about 10 years into it i started having
people from
uh the middle east fly to they flew them
to my office because
the medical doctor at the embassy
in um
in
washington d.c
had a great success i don't even know he
was in the embassy but he started
sending people from the middle east to
my office for fertility
from the middle east it's apparently an
issue
so i would just
they would fly in and i would have them
there for a month and we'd just put them
on the diet
and all of a sudden they started getting
pregnant and they would send over more
people
and it was like it's nothing special
other than the diet
so um
that was interesting that um they would
just fly them out and stay at my office
for a month and i would just put them on
keto and they would become fertile both
both the husband and the wife so that's
another interesting um
experience i had with sorry uh actually
i think this is saudi arabia
and
the the the the great thing about
fertility you've discussed it in your
book the the ovarian type
so
any
mini
most of
those women with ovarian type have pcos
and pcos is triggered by insulin
resistance and uh and problems in the
liver as as have you
as you've discussed in in a lot of uh
episodes in your youtube channel
the problem that and and and the pcos
and intermittent fasting and keto is
well studied now
and published in literally in in pubmed
and
with the with the great studies
we knew when you read
a dietitian or a nutrition literature
recommendation as the the uk
literature
for the pcos that the nutritional
intervention
there is no nutritional intervention
while the only medicine or only cure for
pcos is a nutritional
cure
yeah
yeah they might put them in metformin
but what does metformin do it actually
helps correct at least temporarily
insulin resistance so
yeah there are so many conditions that
are tied into this insulin resistance it
is like the common thread
but um
this is amazing so what i'm going to do
is i want to um
if you're watching this video and you
are from the middle east definitely sign
up on his channel how often do you do
videos
uh lately about
every day okay great
and uh shorts and
long videos i have an episode that i
have
summarized your book in my channel wow
that's great
that's awesome
well what we'll do is we'll uh
definitely try to get people to sign up
on your channel because um there's a lot
of people
um
in the middle east that uh need this
data and uh i'm i'm assuming that you do
it in your arabic language
yes in arabic i hope at the future i
will
have an a new
channel with english language for about
10 to 12 episodes in order to
when i introduce myself to
to
to you or to any doctor in the field in
the local carp community
it's it's been beneficial to have a
english language but my my main language
my channel is in arabic languages
listen there's a lot of people in the
middle east
to educate and they need help so you're
you're doing fine
so we'll stay in communication and i
really appreciate you spending the time
just to chat and we'll do some updates
we'll do more educational things with
our coaches in the near future i just
i'm getting organized i have some new
things i want to share with you and
coaching people so i'll reach out when
those uh
zoom
calls are ready
but uh okay it's my pleasure victor
that's great
very nice meeting you um wish you the
best and i will talk to you real soon
okay of course
okay have a good one
okay bye-bye

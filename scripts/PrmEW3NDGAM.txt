let's talk about the three most common allergies okay first one the most
common one is milk and a true allergy involves a protein so it's really the protein in milk
casein and whey protein and that includes other dairy like cheese ice cream things like that
the primary symptom for a milk allergy is the skin and secondary would be gut and then lung
so it can affect someone in different ways all right number two is shellfish there's
two types of shellfish you have crustacean which is shrimp crab lobster and then you have mollusks
which is clam oyster mussels and scallops about 75% of allergies for shellfish involve crustaceans
okay usually one of these and it can cross over but it's usually one cooking it longer
does not decrease the allergy and there's also a hidden ingredient in the supplement glucosamine
which can also trigger the allergy so just be aware of that now the third most popular allergy
is peanuts now peanuts are legumes okay and so um they're seeds and your body is actually allergic
to that protein now this next part is interesting the protein in milk and the protein in wheat
are usually associated with a lot of autoimmune diseases why is that because there's something
called molecular mimicry what is that it means that the sequence of proteins
in these will mimic the sequence of proteins in your myelin sheath which is the outer covering
of the nerves that you have and the eyelets of langerhan which are basically the cells in
the pancreas that help you make insulin and so the chemistry in these proteins
mimic these and so the antibodies can actually cross react and start attacking
your own tissue and create things like ms or type 1 diabetes so what does that mean it means that
if you have an autoimmune disorder there's certain things that you need to avoid definitely milk and
wheat and probably other common foods that people are allergic to and i would actually just get
tested and avoid any foods that you're allergic to probably the most important thing you can do
to reduce the allergy and hopefully even eliminate the allergy is this thing right here fasting i did
a video on it i'll put a link down below but fasting especially periodic prolonged fasting
increases stem cells for your immune system you can actually regrow a new immune system
when you do fasting now of course vitamin d is going to be very very important as well
the fasting is probably the most important thing you can do to actually get rid of
allergies there's so many people that i've got reports from that no longer have allergies
because they implemented intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting fasting doesn't just
increase your stem cells it decreases inflammation but it increases your t cells which is a part of
your immune system that is very important in reducing risk for autoimmunity and allergies
itself because if you think about an allergy and an autoimmune disease they're both allergies
this one you're allergic to some external food or environmental particle
with this you're allergic to your own tissues your body has antibodies that it's attacking its own
tissues all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

let's talk about women who get hair loss that is related to various hormonal changes
let's first start with the menstrual cycle at day 15 when you're ovulating uh you get this huge
spike of estrogen okay and then in the next two weeks you're going to get a spike in progesterone
and androgen so depending on what time of the month you're getting hair loss will give us clues
as to what hormone is involved but most women tend to lose hair in the second half of the menstrual
cycle when there's a spike of androgens now when a woman goes through menopause they can continue
to have hair loss to some degree because there's this faint hormonal rhythm going on to some degree
so if you're getting hair loss pre-menopause so let's say for example you're in your 20s 30s
or the first part of your 40s right and you're getting hair loss
at the second half of your cycle you need to lower androgens the best way to do that is to lower your
insulin okay that means you need to lower your carbohydrates that is the single most
important thing to help stop hair loss so you want to go on a low carb diet that's keto
as well as doing intermittent fasting but let's say for example you're postmenopausal and your
hair is falling out that is a situation where you're very low in progesterone
you're pretty low in androgens but you're also low in estrogen as well so you have a lessening
of all three hormones in which case you need to take something called dhea that's a precursor
to those hormones and it will help you elevate the hormones but here's a catch-22 if you take a very
small amount let's say 10 milligrams you'll increase more estrogen if you start taking
more let's say 20 30 even 40 milligrams you're gonna also spike androgens too much and that may
cause more hair loss so with taking dhea for hair loss you want to just take a very small amount to
increase estrogen and the other hormones just by a little bit because too much is not a good idea
okay so let's say someone's postpartum they just had a baby and they have this severe drop
in estrogen well that can cause just patches of hair coming out of your head in which case
you need to take 10 milligrams of dhea and that'll bring it up nicely let's say you
have pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome that's a situation where your androgens are too high
simply reduce your insulin by going on keto and intermittent fasting another really good
thing to take to help your pituitary and ovary communication is to take inositol
okay inositol they're actually sweet vitamins there's no sugar in it but inositol will help pcos
big time okay let's say for example your period is very heavy okay and you're losing blood that is
high levels of estrogen in this case you do not want to take dhea you want to take dim now dim
actually does the opposite it lowers estrogen it's a concentrated cruciferous product and it's very
very good for people that are estrogen dominant the other thing you want to take is iron and i
would highly recommend getting that from animal products like red meat liver you can take liver
pills that's the best source of iron all right next scenario let's say for example you have a
slow thyroid because your estrogen increased now how are you going to know that it's high estrogen
well it could be you just gave birth okay that high spike of estrogen will definitely
shut the thyroid down and so if you have a hypothyroid condition right after birth or during
birth then we know it's an estrogen problem or let's say you started taking birth control pills
and then you ended up with a hypothyroid condition or let's say for example you took
hormone replacement therapy and you end up with a slow thyroid or if you have heavy periods which is
high estrogen and you have a slow thyroid then you have clues to know what caused that so what do we
do with high estrogen we take dim what does dim do it lowers estrogen it's a product that you can get
online bile salts greatly help the conversion of t4 to t3 through your liver so taking bile salts
improve a slow thyroid and then selenium is very very important because most hypothyroid cases are
hashimoto's and that's more of a situation where selenium can help you one last scenario let's say
you're taking birth control pills for a period of time and you stop taking birth control pills
all of a sudden your hair starts falling out that is an estrogen crash okay the way to bring that
up is simply by taking an acetol because inositol resets the flow of hormones between your pituitary
and your ovary and lastly you don't want to forget about two additional things
that can cause your hair loss and one is a trace mineral deficiency and a b vitamin deficiency so
trace minerals and b vitamins including biotin can greatly support hair and prevent it from
falling out all right those are the different scenarios that could potentially affect your hair

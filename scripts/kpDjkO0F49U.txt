manopause that's male menopause another name for that would be andropause
if you're male and you're getting older you may be experiencing some of these symptoms
of low testosterone or late-set hypogonadism where your gonads actually are shrinking
as you age which is going to lead to a decreased production of testosterone mood swings irritable
low tolerance to stress anxiety worry even depression decrease muscle mass so
here you are working out trying to build your muscles and nothing's happening lack of energy
lack of vitality man boobs a simpler word for gynocomastia loss of sleep you're not able to get
seven or eight hours anymore you're getting six five hours you just your body won't let you get
enough sleep and the quality is not there which leads to a lack of energy and vitality
erectile dysfunction 70 of all men that reach the age of 70 have erectile dysfunction
low libido all right is there any help can you do anything about it couple things you need to know
the liver is very very important in keeping your testosterone levels normalized there is a protein
shbg that binds with your hormones especially testosterone and even estrogen so it locks
up these hormones and many times this protein will be higher if you test it
and that's going to keep your testosterone low because everything is bound up
so what causes a higher amounts of this protein that locks everything up insulin resistance
and a fatty liver as well as cirrhosis or scar tissue of the liver and this is why
number one keto and if you don't know how to do that i put a link down below vital if
is intermittent fasting the other thing is start consuming more cruciferous vegetables that's gonna
not only help remove fat from the liver and help liver function
but it's also going to detoxify chemicals pesticides things that can act like
estrogen so cruciferous vegetables help lower the amount of estrogen so estrogen
and testosterone work together so if you lower estrogen you have higher amounts of testosterone
zinc is really really important it does a lot of things in the body but it also prevents this right
here and it will increase your testosterone i would recommend about a hundred milligrams per day
i always recommend taking that in a blend of other trace minerals not just zinc because especially
if you're going to do it long term korean red ginseng very very powerful it not only increases
your energy but gives you the calmness so it's kind of like drinking more coffee without the
jittery feelings without the side effects it will give you some nice energy but it also improves
erectile dysfunction and a lowered libido so you get energy you get vitality and you also improve
your testosterone levels now realize that these won't work unless you get your diet fixed so many
people are taking supplements and it's not working because their insulin is too high
and that's blocking the progress other people just actually take testosterone in different pellets
or the injections the problem is when you do this the gland that produces testosterone shrinks even
more and you become dependent on this so you start losing effectiveness over time so it's basically
just treating the symptom you're not getting to the core not to mention if you don't fix your
diet you just kind of patch it up for a little bit and then it does it's not long lasting all right
and the other thing i already mentioned this is to fix your liver if you have a fatty liver
these two will greatly help you by lowering your carbs but adding some choline can speed things up
it can actually get rid of the fat off your liver the other key things that are important to mention
would be to keep your stress as low as possible it's probably impossible to do that right now but
what you can do is you can counter that with more exercise especially long walks if you are tired
if you're not sleeping you need to do less intense exercise
because you want to get rid of stress because if you're actually doing a lot of exercise without
sleep it's hard on the heart but keeping your stress down is going to increase your
testosterone because high levels of stress and cortisol suppress your testosterone but guess what
ginseng is a really good herb that can help lower cortisol and support part of the adrenal gland
that makes cortisol in a stress state as well as in a non-stress state so this is really good
but again this is only one thing there's many things you need to do
all right you want to do whatever you can to get more sleep if you have to take naps
it's fine just stay in bed but sleep is going to be vitally important if you're not getting
enough sleep it's going to be very difficult to actually correct any of these issues right here
and one of the things you need to know is that when you don't get enough sleep your cortisol
stays high your blood sugars are up and down too you'll crave the wrong foods
and then also no snacking on sugar or too many carbs because insulin will nullify testosterone
and other related hormones last point if you're on a statin because your cholesterol is high
do this and that should actually help you but i just wanted to make you aware that statins
definitely lower testosterone in fact they will give you a lot of these symptoms right here
also it blocks your vitamin d so there goes your mood it blocks cholesterol and cholesterol is
needed as a building block to make testosterone and so statins block the precursor to making
testosterone and it lowers testosterone directly all right thanks for watching and
i will see you in the next video before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

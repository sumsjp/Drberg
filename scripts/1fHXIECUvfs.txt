i had a question from someone that wanted to know why am i so tired when i do intermittent fasting
so this video is on that topic now when you originally start keto and you go from a high carb
to a low carb there's going to be a transition period it's called keto adaptation and
some of the common symptoms are keto fatigue so you're not just going to be tired when you're
eating you're going to be tired when you're doing intermittent fasting between the meals as well
that could be just because you haven't adapted the fat and it could also be because your carbs
aren't low enough so if you keep your carbs a little bit higher it's going to be more difficult
to adapt to fat because fat birding is all about depriving your carbohydrates that's what induces
ketosis which is the byproduct of burning fat also it does take some time
to adapt to fat burning and it could take anywhere between three days
to a week sometimes even longer if you have severe insulin resistance or diabetes so if
you've just started keto give it more time make sure your carbs are low number two more potassium
you have billions and billions of these little pumps called sodium potassium pumps that generate
energy electrical current like a battery to power your muscles and your nervous system
and so if your diet does not have enough potassium because you don't like vegetables you're not going
to generate energy magnesium is also required to make the energy currency in the body called atp
and mainly you're going to get it in leafy greens big salads but the one that i want to
emphasize is when you do keto sometimes you can be b1 deficient let me explain when you do high carbs
your body requires a tremendous amount of b1 the more carbohydrate you consume the more b1 you need
and if you're not getting enough b1 you're going to be deficient but when you switch over to keto
you're typically not going to need as much b1 as you did doing high carb however you're
still going to need b1 and if you are doing higher amounts of fat that are not necessarily
mixed with protein for example let's say you're adding mct oil or butter or keto bombs or coconut
oil where you're having these fats out of the normal complex realize that fat does not contain
b1 and so as you're metabolizing that you need b1 to metabolize it and break it down
it could be drawing from your reserves so if you are doing a good amount of fat without the b1
that can create more of a b1 deficiency or at least aggravate that deficiency and give you
some of the b1 symptoms which are fatigue and nervousness and the inability to relax
like you're feeling stressed now there's several other things that people do when they start a
ketogenic diet they tend to drink more coffee and sometimes tea both of these will deplete b1
and that could end up making you tired if you're doing keto and you're doing wine i know
certain programs are okay with you doing the keto friendly wine in my program i don't recommend it
but if you're doing wine wine has two things one is alcohol and the other is sulphites as
a preservative both of those items will deplete you of b1 also if you eat just all cooked foods
that's going to deplete your b1 as well so that's why i recommend a good amount of
raw vegetables things like that now raw fish like in sushi could also create a b1 deficiency and
let's say you're also a diabetic and you're trying keto and you're still in metformin metformin also
depletes b1 big time this is one of the reasons why um people that are on metformin could have a
serious side effect called lactic acidosis that's a b1 deficiency so anyway if you are tired on keto
these are the three things that are going on don't forget about b1 i would always recommend
taking b1 in the form of nutritional yeast thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

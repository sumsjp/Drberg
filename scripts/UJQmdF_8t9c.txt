hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I wanted to answer the question what is the gallbladder okay
now the gallbladder is located underneath the right ribcage right here okay you can see this
is the liver on the right side as a little - the liver makes a fluid that goes into the
gallbladder okay and the gallbladder basically stores bile B IL e okay now bile is not waste
or bowel like people think it's like waste it's now bile breaks down fats it breaks down facts
it's fats like a like a detergent will dissolve grease it breaks down fat into small little tiny
particles so then certain things from the pancreas certain enzymes like lipase which basically breaks
down fats worked in the small intestine to take that already broken down fat into really tiny
particles of fat called essential fatty acids okay so that's what it does so the pancreas and
gallbladder work together to absorb and break down fats so the gallbladder secretes this vial when
you eat fat that's when it's supposed to release it if you don't eat fat it's not going to release
it so it's stores bile it also concentrates file so the bile in that gallbladder is super strong
so you don't need much of it probably like one ounce or two ounces of it and it squashes out
and it comes in the small intestine it does its work right there so here's the thing if you're
actually consuming six meals all day but with snacks you're doing three meals and using snacks
between at night you're grazing and every time you're eating you're basically releasing some bile
especially if you're eat any type of nuts or fats or anything like that well guess what you're going
to really create a loss of this concentration of bile because you're constantly eating is constant
it doesn't have a chance to concentrate so you're going to actually eventually be deficient in bile
so we'll talk about that in a little bit but and that's why in tremendous fasting is so healing to
the gallbladder because it allows the gallbladder to concentrate its file and not have to work so
hard that means eating without snacking through the day okay so it concentrates the bile it
also kills bacteria in your food that's pretty cool alright so now let's go back to this bio
thing the most of emulsification comes from the latin word which means milk which actually means
combining water and fat and that's what milk is it's like a combination of a substance that has
water and fat together because you notice that fat and water don't mix well when you emulsify
it can actually mix better and that's why the bile is emulsifier it's kind of like a it allows the
fat to be broken down and dissolved and mixed up within the rest of the the food coming down from
the small intestine because if you didn't have anything to break down the fat the fat would just
kind of go right through you and it wouldn't be dissolved so bile also helps you lubricate
the colon so when you're deficient in bile you become constipated okay also if you don't have
a lubricated coal and you'll have pain when you're actually digesting when the food kind of does goes
through because it's not lubricated also by UPS alkalis the stomach acids coming down from the
stomach so they'll have the super concentrated acids from the stomach thank goodness we have
the bile to help neutralize it because the bile is alkaline alright now how do you know if you're
deficient in bile well first of all your stools are going to float I don't know if you've ever
tried this as a kid work or you've probably seen people when they have the little stools floating
in the toilet and you try to flush it it doesn't go doesn't go down it just keeps floating that's
some serious amount of fat in there that that person does not have enough bile to break down
the fat okay so the stool should sink unless it has too much fat okay so also a pale color
that would be a lighter color that would be an indication of lower low bile also bad odor anal
leakage and it's oily so those people have low bile because the oils is kind of going right
through them we talked about constipated bloating probably right shoulder pain but this is the big
thing they're going to actually be deficient in fat soluble vitamins that's vitamin A so there
goes the eyes there goes the skin it goes with sinus also vitamin D bone pain poor immune system
that's low vitamin D levels because they don't have enough file vitamin E that's heart skin
hormones vitamin K clotting factors bruising also of k2 high up getting rid of soft tissue calcium
from the arteries very important and then you have a essential fatty acid absorption so essential
fatty acids are those very the color essential for a reason because we need them very important for
your heart very important as an anti-inflammatory they're important for the cell structure in the
cell wall very important to your skin so if you can't absorb essential fatty acid you're going to
have dry skin dry hair so we got even your mood is affected by essential fatty acid there's a
lot of people who take omega-3 or DHA all these healthy fats for certain health conditions well
without this bile you can't absorb it okay so if you feel like you're deficient you just need
to focus on improving the function of their let's say you may be deficient in bile okay what do you
do you can get a purified bile salt product okay I use one called the gall bladder formula this
doesn't necessarily just have purified bile salts it has a lot of other things it has stone root to
help resolve gall stones it has pancreatic enzymes to help you take the pressure off the digestion it
has the pain hydrochloride to help digest the acidify the stomach so it helps the stomach
but got the pancreas the gall bladder Spanish black radish slippery elm bark to lubricate
these little things so it's a really good formula I like it and you take that app Amil you take one
after meal you don't need more than that and some people just take it after one meal now when do you
know that you don't need file is when you have diarrhea why because bio will actually increase
the elimination so if you're already eliminating too much you don't need bio okay also if you have
a hyper thyroid the fire is moving too much and you add bile to it which you don't want to add
that product that's going to speed up more thyroid hormone and you'll have a more hyper thyroid this
would be good for taking bio will be good for someone that has a hypothyroid because bile is
necessary for the conversion of t4 to t3 thyroid so it makes your thyroid work better if it's slow
so the only reason you wouldn't want to take it is if it's too fast which is more rare but just
want to make that note so I hope that helped you understand the gallbladder a bit more on what it
is and people just take these things out like this like it's not important but it really is
important try to keep your gallbladder at all cost alright thank you so much for watching

hi guys let's answer the question is gluten-free healthy on a ketogenic diet what do you think well
actually you see it marketed is gluten-free is it's something really really special and
it's true gluten is very very harmful for your intestines and you want to avoid it like the
plague but just because it doesn't have gluten and it's grain doesn't mean it's going to not affect
your blood sugars okay you can have wheat that is gluten free and it's going to spike your insulin
and quinoa rice sorghum millet oat buckwheat most of these grains have a glycemic index
of right around 50 well guess what sugar has a glycemic index about 59 so it's not that much
off so these will turn in the sugar fairly quickly so we have quinoa some people will say well this
is a protein right it's not a carbohydrate well has one cup is like 24 grams of protein but it
has a hundred and nine grams of carbohydrate four times as much protein okay so it's mostly
carbohydrate so these will turn the sugar now are they better than gluten grains like wheat
absolutely absolutely but you have to factor in of how much you're consuming in your allowable
carbohydrate amount so we want to keep your carbs between 20 and 50 grams per day now per meal per
day so if you wanted to consume some of these in small amounts go for it but just make sure
at the end of the day kind of your carbs and it doesn't exceed 20 to 50 but just because
something's gluten-free doesn't mean anything okay thanks for watching hey you probably already

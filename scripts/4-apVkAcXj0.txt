if you can't turn off your brain when you're trying to sleep try some calcium it's great
for kids any age teenagers in fact i use calcium a lot with my kids great for fevers and no matter
what they come down with as far as an infection calcium just seems to work like a charm
for kids you just give them 50 milligrams i i recommend calcium lactate it's a non-dairy great
calcium good absorption it's you give it to them right before before they go to bed but if you're
deficient in calcium you're not going to be able to sleep as well it can also create muscle cramps
that can keep you up at night but the biggest thing it can actually create a racing mine where
you just can't turn it off but also if you're deficient in b1 that can also create the same
symptom but calcium is needed to allow you to get into rem sleep it's also needed to make melatonin
and so if you have any of these symptoms including a racing mind as you're trying to go to sleep
one thing you might want to try is some calcium lactate i would recommend about
100 milligrams right before bed and i think you'll notice a nice change now that being said
i want to mention something about calcium because i don't really recommend taking
a lot of calcium for a long period of time simply because calcium tends to accumulate in the body it
doesn't you don't get rid of it as easily as other nutrients like magnesium or actually potassium
so there's certain nutrients that that your body has a difficult time getting rid of
calcium iron are two big ones and so because calcium doesn't get eliminated very easily and
as we get older a lot of people have calcium buildup in their joints and their arteries
on their eye and their kidneys and all over the place and so unless you have a need for
calcium i probably would not recommend it as a supplement especially if you're taking
like a thousand milligrams of calcium carbonate every day to because you're post-menopausal i
don't recommend that because it increases your risk of heart attacks but for the most part
try to get your calcium from food unless you have certain symptoms that you need to take some extra
if you haven't seen some of my other videos on calcium i put them up right here check them out

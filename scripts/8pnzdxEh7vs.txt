so we're going to talk about red spots on the skin i had someone ask the
question and there's basically about three or
four different underlying causes to this and it can be any type of shape or size
but usually it's this red little area in the skin and there's various
medical terms for it which i don't want to get
into i just want to talk about what it could be as an underlying root
cause now when you're deficient in vitamin k1
you're not going to be able to clot that well so you're going to get bruising
and and whether it's red or purple you're going to have these little
bruises on your body and that could be the
reason you can also be deficient in vitamin c
because vitamin c controls capillary strength so if you have
a deficiency of vitamin c you're going to get the red spots are going to look a
little bit different they might look like spider veins
or little pockets of this red or purple color because you need vitamin c
to strengthen the capillaries which are the vascular system
just underneath the skin so it could be either vitamin k1 or vitamin c
but in nature vitamin k1 and vitamin c usually come together as a
complex so if you're consuming vegetables you're
going to get a mixture of both of them also your gut makes k1
so if you have a history of antibiotics then it could be
the reason why you're deficient your body just is not making it
so we have vitamin k1 as a possibility vitamin k1 deficiency
vitamin c deficiency but you could also have low amounts of calcium
low calcium will also cause the red spots on the skin
it's very rare to have this happen but it could happen
so low calcium could be one cause another cause
would be a viral infection okay now there's other causes as well
like if you have diabetes or some type of
chronic metabolic problem you're going to see
red spots on the lower extremity right behind your lower legs
like almost like a large blisters or bruising
purple or red that's just poor circulation
but typically most people have these red spots because they're either
not consuming enough of these right here to get these nutrients
or they have some type of malabsorption they're not able to absorb it because
their gut has inflammation or it's damaged from
antibiotics or they had gastric bypass or
they have a fatty liver which will inhibit
the function of vitamin k1 because a lot of the fat soluble vitamins
are stored in the liver so if you have gallbladder problems lack
a bile you had your gallbladder out you're not
going to have the bile to absorb this fat soluble vitamin and
that could be the reason why you have these red spots a gastric bypass
could also create a deficiency of both of these
because it alters the stomach and the gut
now in some circumstances if you add some bile salts
to the diet you can find that you get a lot more absorption of all the fat soluble
vitamins including k1 so it can help your clotting factors
now the foods that are high in k1 kale would be at the top of the list
spinach collard greens just dark leafy greens in general and by the way
all of these are loaded with vitamin c sauerkraut has
the most vitamin c like 700 milligrams per cup
bell peppers are loaded with vitamin c other peppers have a lot of vitamin c
berries have vitamin c lemons have vitamin c
unless it's pasteurized in a container if you get raw lemons
and you take the lemon juice then you have vitamin c if you get it
in a glass jar it's pasteurized and you have
very low levels of vitamin c all right so that's my summary on red
spots on your skin before you go if you have a question

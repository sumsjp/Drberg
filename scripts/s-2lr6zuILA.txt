i think there's so many people that know
for a fact that
osteoporosis is merely lacking calcium
in your bone but the problem with that
viewpoint is when you start taking
calcium
you will make your bones slightly more
dense
but you do not decrease your risk of
getting fractures
so taking calcium is not only not the
answer but it can make things worse
one of the challenges with osteoporosis
is there's really no symptoms but you do
have an increased risk of getting a
fracture and the problem is if you're
older and you fracture your hip
boy the recovery from that is just
devastating most people that fracture
their hip do not live past
a year after the fracture so it's not a
good prognosis
the problem with taking calcium is it
actually increases your risk of getting
a fracture interesting i mean if you
think about it one of the biggest best
predictors
of a myocardial infarction heart attack
is
having a high cac score which stands for
coronary artery calcification score it's
the calcium in your coronary artery that
predicts heart attacks
and so by dumping more calcium into your
body
you're just going to worsen the
situation
calcium is very unique in that we
definitely need it but we really need to
get it from our diet primarily we
shouldn't be getting it from a
supplement at least a lot of it
especially what's recommended i think
it's like a thousand milligrams per day
that's like way way too much because our
body does not get rid of calcium very
easily and that also goes with other
minerals like iron for example whereas
potassium is easily excreted if we have
too much but certain minerals do not
exit the body very easily so if you're
dumping all this calcium in the tissues
you can end up with excess calcium and
if you think about it as people age they
tend to calcify don't they their joints
start filling up with calcium their
arteries fill up with calcium uh they
have all sorts of spurring and they're
in their back but here's some problems
with too much calcium arrhythmias
increase your risk for getting a stroke
heart attack high blood pressure because
the arteries become calcified there's no
elasticity you get soft tissue calcium
not just calcium in the arteries but
calcium in the joints
and the other tissues of the body not to
mention excessive amount of calcium in
your kidneys as a kidney stone
other symptoms would be
constipation depression
psychosis
arthritis tendonitis bursitis
and even abdominal pain so too much
calcium is not good we need sufficient
calcium but we don't need too much some
of the real causes of osteoporosis
include
being on steroids right corticosteroid
hormones or having too much cortisol in
your body for some reason let's say for
example you have a tumor in your adrenal
gland that's pumping out too much
cortisol then you develop a condition
called cushing syndrome where
osteoporosis is one
symptom of that also lower amount of
estrogen so let's say you're going
through menopause or you had your
ovaries removed that can lead to
osteoporosis you need a good amount of
estrogen to prevent osteoporosis and
this is why women tend to get more
osteoporosis than men
taking too much phosphoric acid from
soft drinks right sodas that will do it
not having enough vitamin d this is
really really really a big one right
here so by not only taking vitamin d you
can absorb more calcium from food but
vitamin d also works with vitamin k2
another key vitamin to help calcium go
in the right place if you don't have
sufficient vitamin d
then you really only absorb about 10 of
the calcium from your food so vitamin d
doesn't have all these other side
effects like calcium does
malnutrition can also cause osteoporosis
let's say you're deficient in the trace
minerals or amino acids things like that
that could be a problem if you're on
ppis because you have heartburn or gerd
you're removing the stomach acid which
then
really blocks your ability to absorb
all minerals and so since bone is
composed not just of calcium but
minerals and also phosphorus and a lot
of other things including protein ppis
can really create a problem gastric
bypass can be a risk factor as well as
malabsorption where you don't have a
healthy lining of the colon to be able
to absorb certain nutrients then you
could be at risk of osteoporosis
here's the solution okay number one get
your calcium from food i would say the
best source getting bioavailable calcium
would be
raw milk cheese okay if you can get some
of that that would be the ideal
situation
also leafy greens would do it sardines
fish
nuts all have calcium
increase your vitamin d to at least 20
000 iu's per day and don't forget about
k2 because you always need these
together very very important i would
recommend if you're going to take 20 000
international units of vitamin d then
you need 200 micrograms of this k2
together all right vitamin c very very
important in bone health okay you need
vitamin c for collagen which is a type
of protein in bone bone is not just
minerals it's part protein and vitamin c
is a key factor if you don't have enough
vitamin c you're not going to be able to
build bone in fact people that have a
sub clinical vitamin c deficiency
like a borderline scurvy situation their
bones are always osteoporotic
trace minerals very very important in
activating the protein in your bone as
well as being a part of the bone
and so a good trace metal product will
be essential for bone and i want to back
up to vitamin c make sure you take a
food based vitamin c not a synthetic
version of vitamin c
adequate quality protein is also
important so
if you're getting your protein from just
like peanut butter or for example some
soy protein
powder or something like that that would
not be a good source of protein eggs are
the best source seafood shellfish
fish
meat
all
high quality protein
betaine hydrochloride is another thing i
would recommend if you have osteopenia
or osteoporosis because
that fixes
the lack of stomach acid that's probably
creating all the symptoms for acid
reflux so obtain hydrochloride
especially as you're getting older it's
important to start absorbing these
minerals as well as breaking down the
protein that's needed to form bone on
that note i think the next most
important video to watch would be the
one on vitamin k2 check it out i put it
right here

had another question related to intermittent fasting and pregnancy is it safe to do
well there's some questions you need to ask first because there is a way to do it healthily but
first let's go through these questions number one will your pattern of doing intermittent fasting
and eating create nutrient deficiencies if it does then you don't want to do it because this is the
most important time to get nutrients in your body because that growing baby is developing and if
you're deficient in even one micronutrient iodine the iq of that child will be severely suppressed
so above all else the most important thing is to make sure you're getting the nutrients
from the food i mean you could still do six meals a day not intermittent fasting
and be nutrient deprived right that's not good so let's say for example you had two meals were very
very sufficient in nutrients and calories and you didn't snack and you were adapted
to keto i don't see any problem with that but let's go down the list number two will it worsen
your blood sugars so if you're pregnant and then all of a sudden you quickly jump into keto and
intermittent fasting maybe you want to gradually get into it because if you do it too fast
and you don't know what you're doing you can end up with low blood sugars and that's not healthy
but doing it gradually and letting your body tell you when you're hungry and when you should eat um
that might make more sense all right next question is will it affect your sex hormones like estrogen
androgens progesterone things like that well not necessarily intermittent fasting does not affect
those hormones in a negative way but other things do like food if you're consuming too much soy for
example or you're consuming a lot of commercial dairy which has a lot of estrogen in it that
can throw off your estrogen and that probably is not the best thing to do all right now androgens
in a female body one way to trigger androgens is to increase insulin and that's the next
point right here will your intermittent fasting pattern of fasting and eating affect insulin well
it's going to normalize insulin if you're doing fasting in low carb but if you're doing a high
carb diet you are going to spike insulin and high insulin leads to high androgens
which can cause pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome which one symptom is infertility and you lose your
cycle if high insulin causes pcos infertility why would you want to do something to raise
insulin when you're pregnant we're trying to provide the environment for that baby to
thrive in so anything that increases insulin when you're pregnant is not a healthy thing
and i'm also talking about a lot of different snacks especially if they're carbohydrates
all right last point will it affect cortisol and the answer is i did a whole video on this no it'll
actually improve your cortisol levels because it will help lower stress especially if you do this
correct i'm going to put a link down below for that and during ramadan fasting is contraindicated
for pregnancy but think about this ramadan you're fasting for a longer period of time during the day
and also it's for 29 to 30 days so that's a little bit different than what we're talking about with
intermittent fasting where you're eating two meals maybe spaced out through the day in summary
the answer is not as simple as a yes or no you have to factor in these other points but the
most important thing is to get enough nutrients to keep that fertility very high hey before you

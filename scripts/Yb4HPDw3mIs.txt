hi guys i recently had a question what
multivitamins and minerals do i need on
a ketogenic diet
well the first thing you need to do and
a lot of people
will use vitamins as a crutch because
they don't they don't want to consume
the amount of vegetables that they
really need you really need to do that
because
we want to get as many vitamins and
minerals from the
vegetables as possible seven to ten cups
not just for the vitamins minerals but
to flush out the fat
so we need that those greens those
healthy
vegetables okay however when you're
switching from
sugar burning to fat burning you're when
you're adapting you need
certain nutrients you need more of
certain nutrients you definitely need
more
b vitamins vitamin b6 b5 b1 and b12
i recommend getting these in nutritional
yeast you can get in a powder
i have nutritional yeast in a tablet
form to make it easy to consume
this is a non-fortified when you consume
nutritional yeast
you don't want to fortify it enrich it
with synthetic vitamins
and i also added some natural b12 you
also need minerals specifically
potassium magnesium and sodium
when you're on a low carb diet you need
more
salt so consume about one teaspoon of
salt
if you're on a high carbohydrate diet
only have about a quarter teaspoon of
salt
but we do need a lot of potassium we
need a good amount of magnesium
i use the electrolyte powder because it
has a thousand milligrams of potassium
citrate
has a good amount of magnesium and has a
little bit of sodium so you may need to
enhance the sodium because this does not
have a lot of sodium
but this is cool because it doesn't have
any maltodextrin it doesn't have any
sugar and it has the trace minerals in
it as well
you also need vitamin d3 you can get
this from sunlight or
fish oils and that way you can kill two
birds with one stone you can get your
omega-3
so if you had a high quality cod liver
oil you can get d3
and omega-3 okay and then you have the
trace minerals which are those minerals
that are needed in much smaller amounts
it's hard to find that in the diet and
it can really help you
so an example would be like chromium
iodine selenium
so again the goal is to try to get as
much of the vitamins and minerals
from the food but i also recommend
enhancing it
with the b vitamins minerals d3 omega-3
and trace minerals

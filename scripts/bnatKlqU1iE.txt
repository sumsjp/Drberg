all right so we have the biggest mistake in trying to rid acne trying to wash off your acne
like it's some dirt or something those blackheads that you have are not dirt when you use detergents
and cleansers and alcohol wipes and antibacterial creams you're literally destroying your microbiome
on the surface of your skin you have millions and billions of microbes throughout your body
and especially on your skin that act as a barrier that's involved in the immune system
and when you remove that layer of good bacteria you have less variety of these friendly microbes
and that weakens your immune system and that increases inflammation on the skin so it can
not only worsen acne it can even cause acne think about one of the side effects from an antibiotic
it's acne that's one of the side effects so why is that because there's crosstalk between the
microbes in your gut and the microbes throughout the body on even the surface of your skin
and so if one part of your body is lacking microbes it's going to stress another part
so if we take a look at acne it's involving a gland called the sebaceous gland and there's oil
that's secreted from that gland called sebum and so acne is basically the enlargement of this gland
with excess amount of sebum as well as pus formation and bacteria inside that little gland
and all you need to do is understand the mechanism of how this occurs to reverse it and so i really
wish i knew about what i'm going to tell you when i went to school because i had really bad acne and
i did this right here i scrubbed with all sorts of detergents and i put different creams on it
never worked it never worked and also if you're taking a vitamin like vitamin a or vitamin e
that's not going to even create a dent into this problem unless you understand this and
you apply what i'm going to tell you acne comes from high levels of this hormone called androgens
this is why when you're a teenager and your androgen starts spiking at very high levels and
so it's the excess amount of androgens that causes a problem with this gland if you have a normal
level of androgens you will not have acne now what causes the excessive amount of androgens is this
right here insulin you have too much insulin take another condition called pcos polycystic ovarian
syndrome that is the problem where you're losing hair acne it happens in women because the ovaries
are cystic and they're pumping out a lot of androgens because of high levels of insulin that's
really what's behind it and so all you need to know now is what causes insulin it's high carbs if
you went in a low-carb diet okay and you cut the carbs out your acne will go away if you combine
low-carb diet with intermittent fasting you will experience an even faster elimination of acne and
your skin will be amazing if you're not familiar with the ketogenic diet or intermittent fasting
or what to eat i put a link down below but having acne is completely unnecessary you just need to
understand the mechanism and exactly what to do in fact when i was in practice for over 29 years
i can't even recall even one case that this didn't work on so give it a shot try it out
and put your success stories down below before you go if you have a question about a product
or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you
need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call

so i had a question for someone that wanted to know what tests
should i get in my yearly checkup so i just wanted to answer that
on this video now of course if you have some pre-existing problem whether the
thyroid you have diabetes autoimmune disease you're going to be
doing like advanced liver testing thyroid testing if you're
a diabetic you would do an a1c testing you probably already can test yourself
at home with your blood glucose levels and if you're a pre-diabetic or a
diabetic i always recommend trying to get this test right
here homa ir now one of the problems
that happens as soon as you start keto you start improving
insulin resistance your insulin drops down
and then you go get the test ideally it'd be great to get this test before
you start keto and then do an after test and you'll see
a dramatic improvement in this test right here
homa ir is a test to determine if you have insulin resistance
or not you're going to be looking at fasting glucose and fasting insulin
and there's a certain formula you're going to do to determine if you have
insulin resistance or not but sometimes doc's never even heard of
it and they won't even recommend it so you want to find a doctor that can do
this but if you already started keto and
intermittent fasting and you're doing great
you don't need to do this but it would just be a good before and
after improvement on that test now as far as getting
checkups from your doc routine i'm sure they're going to recommend what you need
but cbc complete blood count you're probably
going to get a basic metabolic panel which is going to look at a lot of
different areas of your body they may or may not recommend a vitamin
d test i think this is very very important since
most people are very very deficient they may not recommend this test i would
recommend it if you've never had it before
it's called a cac test or a scan coronary artery calcium scoring
very important test way more valuable than a cholesterol test because they're
going to look into the coronary artery and identify how much calcium you have
in there and give you a number based on a scale and so you
want it zero some people have over a thousand
and that is not good but it's good to know where you're at
because you can always improve it but if it's over a thousand
you have to take this very seriously and get on strict keto
immediately because you're going to be at risk but this is a very important
test and let's say for example it is high
then you can each year just get another one and see
how it comes down let's say it's normal and you're doing
keto and you're doing intermittent fasting and you're
you're sticking to it do you need to do it no because it was normal and you're
not doing anything to make it worse this test i think is a very important
thing to take every year it's your omega three to six
ratio test but you don't need to go to the doctor
to get this test done all you need is a little kit
and a drop of blood now the importance of this test is to
look at the ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 and the problem is the vast majority of
the population are very heavy on the omega-6 these are
inflammatory and very low on the omega-3 and so it'd
be really good to know where you're at and where you should be
so you can start to reverse this and you reverse this by not
only taking omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil or olive oil
but also by eliminating these other oils which is pretty much in
so many foods at the grocery store it's just crazy i put a link down below of a
lab that you can get this kit to get
yourself tested and if you use my code you'll get the
maximum discount now i am getting zero from this i'm not
getting any kickbacks or favors or anything i told the company
it's a good company that i want to pass the maximum savings on to
you so it's like you get 20 off so if you
want to get the kit and test yourself the links down below now another point i
want to mention if your cholesterol is high
this is a very important test to get it's called advanced
lipid test where they're looking at the size of the particles
and they go deeper into the types of lipoproteins that you have
and um this will actually give you all the data you need
versus just total cholesterol or or your ldl cholesterol or your hdl cholesterol
and your triglycerides so i highly recommend doing this if you
have high cholesterol or you're concerned
i'll put some videos down below but for the most part
personally i don't go crazy with testing but these are some good points to know
about and just to have data as a screening
tool to see where you're at each year thanks for watching before you go if you
have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a
debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the US
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

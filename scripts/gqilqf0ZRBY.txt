so in this video we're going to talk about pain there's really two main
situations one is from an injury or a past injury while the other is no injury
or no history of injury into that area so those are the two main categories I
tell you there's a lot of problems pain just turning on without any history or
any problem right here and that's pretty much what I want to talk about because
if you do therapy on these type of areas of the body without getting the the
problem with the referral like where it's being referred to it as the root
problem you end up not really getting anywhere at all so of course therapy
works on an injury but if they have no injury let's take a look at what it
could be so first of all the right shoulder right through here up through
here and to the neck around the sky the trap over here this is referred by
something called the phrenic nerve that comes from your gall bladder right here
so either when the gall bladder is removed gall bladders kind of congested
or you have some types of problems with lack of bile that's supposed to flow
through there to help you digest because you're eating bad or Yuting a lot of
nuts that pain is going to go right up into the right shoulder and sometimes
even right down here right through here it's going to definitely go into cause
headaches so most the headaches are coming from the gall bladder
okay so always look to the liver gall bladder for right shoulder stuff through
here or headaches look for look at the gall bladder okay now next thing is um
we're going to talk about left shoulder it could be a heart problem now I'm not
saying it's a serious like heart attack but it what happens when the pulse rate
goes high the heart works harder and it anchors itself to the front of the
breastbone of the breastbone and the back and it creates a tightness and that
tightness could cause tension up here up through here all the way down to this
arm could be the elbow the hand so that it could be a heart problem and it
usually is because the person's not sleeping or they're exercising too much
and they're creating stress in the heart combined with not sleeping and stressed
and then they start getting this pain right here or a tightness on this side
right here okay now if the person neck tightness or trap right through
here that's usually digestion they need more stomach acids or they have a
congestive stomach and the foods not digestion they usually have a lot of
acid reflux or indigestion and it's going to make the neck really really
tight now being a chiropractor I used to just these people three times
a week for the rest of their life and it would always just cut back out because I
never looked at the digestive system okay let's talk about the mid-back like
right back over here that's if it's right in the center it's going to be
more of the heart that's anchoring itself and really really tight because
the person is not sleeping there's stress and they're exercising too much
or they even stop smoking and then all of a sudden the heart got weak because
they stopped smoking in the body was dependent on it and now you took that
away and it never adapted so they just never recover from an injury if we take
a look at the lower back it could be a problem with the uterus heavy periods
fibroids a hysterectomy several babies it creates a weakness in that area and
it can refer to the lower back in the center
it's called l5 or it could be more of a prostate enlargement and could be
referred to your lower back also the next thing could be is if it's the left
or right hip joints call the sacroiliac joints that could be the left or right
ovary problem and you treat the back it never goes away because the ovaries are
referring pain back if there's pain all over that's called fibromyalgia you want
to check for the adrenal because that with the adrenals control the
anti-inflammatory so when you run out of them you end up with inflammation
systemically okay then we have the knee problem the knee problem is usually an
adrenal because the adrenal creates a catabolic effect on the quadriceps
femoris that connects to the knee it makes the knee weaker on that side it
also affects the collagen so that collagen could make grinding and popping
on the knee and then we have the right leg or foot problem on the right side
that that uses liver and it's referring problems down here and usually there
their diet is very poor they're drinking alcohol and it's referring all the way
down to that leg or foot or toe or ankle now if it's the left
swollen and pain it could be a weak heart because the heart's not pushing
blood on that side and it's pooling so we want to be able to differentiate
those two so I wanted to kind of give you some background behind the pain
behind the referral of pain so you have some ideas to ask questions to pull the
string and you don't end up just treating the symptom because it's never
going to work one last thing when you're treating a
problem it doesn't solve you got the wrong problem so this gives you some
insights on possible other issues

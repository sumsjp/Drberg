i wanted to create this short little video on the relationship between your mid-back and your stress
level there is a connection there's something called the sympathetic nervous system and the
sympathetic nervous system is the flight or fight mechanism and when that's activated you go through
stress and the question is where is it located in your body it's located in your middle back from t1
to t12 you have 12 vertebrae in that area and along the side of the spine you have these little
nerves and that's what your sympathetic nervous system is the other location of the flight or
flight mechanism is inside your adrenals okay that's for another video i just want to talk
about the mid-back because if you have stiffness and pain in your middle back or a muscle spasm
that's going to keep you in a bit of stress mode and if you're in stress mode that has the ability
to keep your back stiff and in pain also if you're eating the wrong foods your digestive system
can can actually go into a spasm like bloating and cause back pain as well and actually keep you in
stress mode this could affect your sleep it can keep you from relaxing so there are three things
that i'm going to recommend to help you with stress that really work number one going to
a chiropractor and getting adjustment in your mid-back and in fact when i was in ninth grade
i remember my mother taking me to the chiropractor i had no idea what they did i laid on the table he
gave me this adjustment it was literally like a religious experience it was incredible i felt
amazing relief i felt instant stress relief and i stood up and i said do you like what you do and
he goes yeah i go i want to do this so that's when i actually decided to be a chiropractor
so if you've never had an adjustment from a chiropractor find a good one get an adjustment
in your mid-back you'll see what i'm talking about number two you can get a massage in your mid-back
number three you can do very specific stretches to your middle back there's a really good one
i'm gonna put a link down below that involves stretching the mid-back up and down it's called
cats and dogs using the egoscue method very simple but you'll find out after doing this exercise
a huge relief in stress and there's another technique that i developed using my massage tool
that you can actually place this tool in your back on a chair and slowly push it down and stretch
over the device to actually release your stress you can also do this lying down but
anyway i wanted to create this short video on the relationship between your mid-back and your stress
so if you're having problem sleeping or your stress definitely try one of these three
techniques and see if it can help you hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

now i talked a lot about the importance of magnesium but today we're going to talk about
when not to take magnesium the danger of taking too much magnesium is when the body cannot get
rid of it normally we have a mechanism in our kidneys that can easily get rid of excess amounts
of magnesium but there's certain conditions where we can't there's also certain laxatives that you
can get that are magnesium based which will give you like 5000 milligrams of magnesium
per day and our bodies really only need less than one tenth of that so if we're taking that much
and there's certain organ problems that prevent the elimination of magnesium then you could be in
trouble here are just a few symptoms of what could occur if you have too much magnesium diarrhea
nausea abdominal cramping low blood pressure depression lethargy difficulty breathing
irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest now let's talk about four situations in which you would
not want to take a lot of potassium maybe you could take up to 200 milligrams and you wouldn't
necessarily have to worry about it from your food but you wouldn't want to be taking large amounts
number one and the big one is kidney disease if you have chronic kidney disease that's going to
really inhibit your ability to get rid of the excess now if you're a diabetic and you have
something called diabetic nephropathy now that's different than neuropathy which is a nerve problem
nephropathy is a kidney problem all right next one is if you're on dialysis okay
and also if on your urine test you see something that says low gfr that indicates that your kidneys
ability to filter is lower than it should be so you're not going to get rid of excessive magnesium
all right next condition is hypothyroidism in hypothyroidism everything is slowed down okay
and then you have addison's disease which is a condition of your adrenal glands which they're
pretty much shot they're not working it's a hypoadrenal state and so again you're not going
to be able to get rid of excessive magnesium and lastly if you're taking certain medications that
can inhibit your ability to get rid of magnesium like fosamex that's normally for osteoporosis
certain antibiotics uh diuretics and lithium all right thanks for watching and i put some links

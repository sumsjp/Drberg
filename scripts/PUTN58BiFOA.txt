so I wanted to do a video on heart symptoms that you may not be aware of
because most people think about heart problems of having chest pain okay or
left arm pain or left shoulder pain or pain in left jaw or even cold sweats so
most people know these right here but they might not be aware of other
symptoms okay that relate to heart problems and I'm talking about a deeper
problem with the heart that could involve the artery becoming clogged the
heart muscle becoming very rigid and losing its elasticity or maybe the
ventricle which is the pump becoming dilated enlarged or the entire heart
becoming enlarged so all of those symptoms could create these known
symptoms but let's talk about the ones that very few people make the connection
number one chronic coughing while you're laying down okay that potentially could
be a symptom of an underlying heart problem now also realize that this could
be a calcium deficiency as well or some type of weakness within your immune
system it could be a virus so it's not necessarily always a heart but it could
be especially if you have the majority of these symptoms right here
nausea this could come from a lot of things it could be your gall bladder
your digestion your stomach but it potentially could relate to a
cardiovascular situation swelling in your lower legs or ankles especially on
the left side because the heart is on the left side if you have more swelling
on the right side that potentially could be more liver related what's
happening is the heart is losing its function as a pump and fluid is backing
up in the lower part of the body next one is pitting edema which relates to
this right here so when you press into the lower part of your leg or the ankle
it leaves a dent into the tissue so that's fluid backing up into the tissues
all right next thing is fainting okay that's one lack of energy upon exertion
so you start to exercise and you just don't have the energy so that could be
that you're really really out of shape or potentially could be the heart next
one heavy legs when you're climbing stairs are going up an incline now that
could be an adrenal issue as well or it could be the heart but realize that the
adrenals back up the heart also the other one is just you're out of breath
when climbing stairs or going up an incline so that's another common heart
symptom and last one ascites okay that's a situation where you have this
protruding belly which is fluid leaking from the liver but that fluid in the
belly could put a lot of pressure up to the organs to affect the heart it looks
like fat but it's mainly fluid and you usually see this scenario with the
skinny guy on the beach with a potbelly that could potentially be ascites but it
could also be fat too so it's not always that situation all right now that you
have the complete picture on some symptoms related to the heart what
should you do about it I think one of the most important tests that you should
get is a coronary artery calcification test there's some other names for it but
this test measures the amount of calcium in the coronary artery around the heart
and it's one of the best predictors of mortality from heart attacks you want
this score to be zero okay some other things and nutrients that I highly
recommend you want to be on vitamin k2 vitamin k2 keeps the calcium out of the
arteries and in the bone where it belongs and k2 also works with vitamin
d3 these two together are a really good combination the next most important
vitamin is vitamin E I don't recommend getting a typical synthetic vitamin E
get a high-quality combination between tocopherols and tocotrienols get the
whole thing and start taking that vitamin E is one of the most important
vitamins for the heart it'll protect the inside of the arteries from oxidation
because it's an antioxidant and it will also increase the levels of oxygen in
the heart muscle tissue preventing scarring and fibrosis of the heart
tissue and that helps make your muscles a lot stronger
too so you'll notice when you take it you're just gonna feel stronger and
there's some interesting Studies on how this can reduce the symptoms of heart
problems especially angina which is chest pain the foods that are high in
vitamin E are the leafy greens and nuts and seeds number three you need to get
off carbs immediately the carbs are clogging the artery and they're creating
the problem because it spikes insulin not to mention filling your liver with
fat which then puts more pressure on the heart so you need to be on a healthy
keto diet without any question if you if you don't know what I'm talking about I
put a link down below on what to do number four fasting vitally important to
reduce inflammation and also get into ketosis so your heart especially if it's
damaged would prefer ketones as their main fuel source so when you fast and
get off carbs you increase ketones it wouldn't hurt to take some MCT oil which
also will turn into ketones and feed the heart and also by the way the feeds the
brain as well and go for long walks on a kind of a flat surface because what you
want to do is you want to keep your stress low but you want to get a lot of
oxygen into the heart into the tissues you can even do hyperbaric oxygen
therapy which is another great thing to infuse these cells with a super amount
of oxygen because what someone with a damaged heart has is hypoxia which is a
lowered amount of oxygen in the tissues because of damage if you want more
information about this CAC test I put a link right here

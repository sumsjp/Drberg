I have a very very interesting article I want to post down below and it has to do
with metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome another name for that would be
syndrome X where your lipids like cholesterol is too high you have insulin
resistance you have high blood sugar high blood pressure central obesity now
in this article they're talking about why metabolic syndrome should really be
called hyperinsulinemia syndrome now the traditional conventional viewpoint on
this is that insulin resistance leads to increased insulin okay but is that
actually true is it the insulin resistance that causes high insulin or
is it the high insulin that causes insulin resistance now to figure this
out all we have to do is observe what happens after gastric bypass where
they're bypassing part of the small intestine which is one part of the body
that affects insulin the other part is the pancreas but there's something in
the small intestine that activates insulin so when you do gastric bypass
you correct part of the high insulin problem so you reduce insulin and they
find after this procedure that it reverses type-2 diabetes by 83 percent
it also reverses high blood pressure by 63 percent as well as reversing high
cholesterol by 61 percent now let's take a look at this diabetes type 2 that's
high blood sugar hypertension and cholesterol isn't that syndrome X right
here but it also does several other things that improve sleep apnea
polycystic ovarian syndrome it improves a fatty liver GERD which is a like an
acid reflux and even joint pain now this study that I'm basing this on is this
very interesting because they looked at 423 other studies but focused on 58 of
the ones that actually measured insulin so the direct finding was if you reduce
insulin you produced changes across the board with so many
different conditions and metabolic syndrome is just kind of a collection of
several diseases or shall we say symptoms of this high insulin now think
about it when you have high insulin over a period of time the body is going to
start to resist it the insulin receptors are going to start to resist at high
level so it's really high insulin that causes the insulin resistance and of
course once you have insulin resistance in the bio feedback loops they're gonna
come back and actually raise more insulin but really only if you keep
consuming the things that trigger insulin carbohydrates frequent eating
now in type 2 diabetes you have insulin resistance and you also have high
insulin for a period of time until the cells that make insulin get weaker and
weaker and weaker and that goes lower lower lower and your blood Sugar's go
higher and higher and higher so you initially have high insulin and
it kind of goes lower and in obesity you have high insulin as well but you could
also have diabetes type 2 and not be overweight you can be skinny and still
have insulin why is this so important well if it is true that high insulin
leads to insulin resistance that leads to pre-diabetes and then diabetes then
it would be very very important to actually measure insulin early on and
not only focus on blood sugars identifying through a blood test what
your insulin is doing would be the best indicator to predict and even prevent
insulin resistance as well as pre-diabetes and diabetes but
unfortunately there are certain doctors that just don't connect the dots they're
focused primarily on the blood sugars and the bigger problem of that not
understanding this concept is to eventually start prescribing insulin to
a diabetic type 2 I mean think about this if you have hyperthyroidism we have
too much thyroid hormones would you ever give that patient more thyroid hormones
or let's say you have a hyper cortisol problem it's called
Cushing's would you give that patient high cortisol of course not but you
would only know if they had high cortisol or high thyroid hormone or high
insulin if you tested it unfortunately that's rarely tested in summary it's a
high insulin that occurs way before the pre-diabetes and diabetes a person will
not have high blood sugars for many years but they may have a lot of other
problems that will then be treated separately like they do with the lipids
and high blood pressure and a lot of these other things and lastly and more
importantly if you're new to my channel the the things that trigger insulin are
primarily the overconsumption of carbohydrates and the frequent eating
and the snacking that people are involved with to prevent their blood
sugars from dropping if you want more information on how to deal with that

so today i'm going to talk about the huge problem with the glycemic index it gives you some data
and so if you're only relying on the glycemic index you're going to set yourself up for a lot
of failure because it only tells you a small part of the big picture so the glycemic index covers
a range of foods on a scale that rates a food's ability to raise your blood glucose so on the
glycemic index a food less than 55 would be considered low and so this is based on using 50
grams of absorbable carbs so you're minusing the fiber even though that's a carb it doesn't have an
effect on insulin a twix candy bar is considered low on the glycemic index pizza hut supreme pie is
considered low on the glycemic index betty crocker chocolate cake is considered low
and a hundred percent stone ground whole wheat bread is considered low so right off the bat
the glycemic index is not based on real world serving size consumption all right the next point
people never eat just one food on the scale for example are you just going to eat a piece of bread
no you're going to put something on it like peanut butter and jelly right
or some meat and cheese number three when you're combining protein or fat with a sugar or something
that turns into sugar pretty quickly you create something called advanced glycated end products
which is a type of protein that ends up not being used in the body but it clogs everything up
it destroys your vascular system it destroys your vision your circulation your neurons in
your brain so this is just one additional negative effect of glucose when it's combined with protein
or fat all right number four low glycemic fructose is worse than glucose so on the scale
at 100 which is considered high you have glucose and then when we get into the lower part we have
a type of sugar called fructose which is only 19 which is very low on the glycemic index and
then if we combine fructose with glucose we get sucrose and that's why it's about right here but
here's the big problem the receptors in your body for glucose are pretty much all over the body the
receptors for fructose are only in your liver so when you consume fructose you're creating a lot
of damage to the liver because you're not able to spread out this sugar evenly throughout the body
it's more concentrated right to the liver and so the liver has to deal with it
it gets overloaded and that's when you start creating inflammation additional toxic waste
a lot of free radical damage and you create more insulin resistance which then leads to diabetes
so fructose is actually a lot worse than glucose and quite a few other sugars have a combination
of fructose and glucose like for example agava nectar has a much larger percentage of fructose
than glucose even though fructose is low in the glycemic index it actually is going to create a
lot more damage relating to your blood sugars than if you were to consume glucose and just as a side
note no one consumes straight glucose by itself and it's pretty bizarre if you were to get a
glucose tolerance test and check your blood sugar by going to the doctor they may give you a glucose
drink and then check your blood sugars after you do that to determine how you react to glucose but
in real life you're never consuming straight glucose it's always a combination of things
and number five the glycemic index ignores the glycemic load the glycemic load is a much better
measurement because it's looking at the glycemic index plus the amount of
carbohydrates and so you're going to get a more accurate measurement of what's happening inside
the last thing i want to mention is this thing called the insulin index the insulin index which i
wrote about in my book is all the non-carbohydrate foods that have effect on insulin this
is way better than the glycemic index because it looks at fat and it also looks at protein and just
as an fyi the less fat that's in a protein the higher things are on the insulin index and this
is why whey protein which is virtually free of fat it's very very concentrated protein is one of the
highest things on the glycemic index and so if you knew about that you would always consume protein
with more fat you don't want to cook a burger for example that's lean protein you'd want to have the
fattiest meat that you could find if you wanted to keep your insulin as low as possible and just
to give you more information about the glycemic load i put the video up right here check it out

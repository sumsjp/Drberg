so i wanted to touch on the topic of the thyroid gland but specifically a goiter what is a goiter a
goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland you have this little gland in the brain called the pituitary
it makes a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone which then connects to the thyroid gland
two main purposes of the thyroid stimulating hormone number one it tells the thyroid to release
t4 and t3 to some degree but it also has another purpose to increase the size of the thyroid gland
so if there's too much of this hormone that could be one reason why it's enlarged and one
of the big reasons for a goiter would be an iodine deficiency in fact ninety percent of
the time it's going to be an iodine deficiency not a hundred percent ninety percent and realize
most of time it's going to be benign it's not going to be a malignant tumor now this condition
mostly is associated with a hypothyroid gland but sometimes it can be associated with a hyper
thyroid gland so you have to be able to think with all the information because if you have
an enlarged thyroid and you have symptoms of a hyper your eyes are bulging out you have a high
pulse rate fast metabolism you're sweating you can't sleep versus hypo which is you're sluggish
you're losing your hair you're depressed um you're gaining weight then that would be more over here
okay so if you have hypo of course you'd want to take iodine if you have hyper you don't want to
take iodine there's several reasons why a person might be deficient in iodine one could be they
just don't get it in their diet because they're not consuming shellfish or seaweed or sea kelp
or eggs for example but it could also be they're exposed to bromide bromide is used as a
conditioner in dough or flour when they're making bread that could be one reason there's other ways
that you could be exposed to bromide but bromide will deplete iodine also fluoride unless you
have a good filter at your house you're probably getting fluoride that can deplete your iodine too
number three i already talked about this number four pregnancy it's very important if a woman
is pregnant or lactating that they're taking some trace minerals specifically iodine because
if that child is born with iodine deficiency they can have hearing problems even become death and
they can also have mental deficiencies as well so iodine is very very important in the formation of
the brain smoking can cause a deficiency of iodine alcohol can create a deficiency and low selenium
now when someone has a goiter and they get tested they may find that their t3 is a little bit higher
than it should be now that's weird you would think that would be low but what's happening is
the body is trying to convert as much as it can to compensate so you might have higher t3 and lower
t4 all right that's my summary of the goiter before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

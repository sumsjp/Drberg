hey guys I want to answer a question when is the best time to exercise and what I'm talking about
is more high-intensity exercise okay what do you think morning or evening okay I'll tell you it's
going to be right here in the evening okay now I'm going to actually post a link below to give
you a little research on why that is but they've done a lot of studies on this and they found that
when you workout in the evening you recover is much much better than in the morning and
even no exercise an evening will spike your cortisol a little bit more it clears out a
lot faster than if you're working out in the morning so so when you're working out it's all
about keeping cortisol recovered keeping your body recovered so you can maximize the benefits
not just weight loss but recovery in general and evening is it now I work out sometimes I
work out at 7 or 8 o'clock in terms of work out at 6 o'clock but I never work out in the morning
now if you are an adrenal type and you're not going to be doing high-intensity you can easily
do walking in the morning that's not an issue but I'm talking about high-intensity interval
training any type of heavy duty type workouts the other thing is if you work out twice if
you're a really top athlete and you work out twice and let's say you do an intense workout
and walking well you can do the walking in the morning as long as you're the intense workout
at night and you're going to see a little bit better improvement okay with testosterone as
well all right so go ahead and post your comments and I'll put the link down below you can check
out the article or the research and go ahead and apply this and see how it works for you

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to discuss olive olive oil and olive leaf okay
olive leaf extract so first of all olives have been around for a long time it's actually
considered a fruit really good in preventing clotting now that's going to help with strokes
so many people are on medication to thin their blood well olives are natural floods binning
agent without any side effects it's loaded with vitamin E vitamin A in a pre vitamin A
form copper iron really good for high blood pressure okay so those are olives and then
you have the oil from the olive extra virgin I would recommend but this oil is a really
potent anti-inflammatory it's considered in a weak ibuprofen because it has effect on pain
and headaches has there's a lot of studies on cancer and how it can actually improve the risk
of cancer loaded with vitamin E doesn't have a lot of vitamins but vitamin E it does have but
it does support the cardiovascular system and it also is good to improve V if there's any type of
damage in the artery wall which is always the precursor for a clot so it's good for the heart
it's good for blood sugars but olive leaf extract is something that I really recommend a lot it's
antiviral antibacterial antifungal it's just an overall good killer of bugs in your body and even
if you have something like MRSA this is what I would be taking I remember one time I had the
flu and I took this with an hour I was better so it's really good for viral infections and
other infections some people take it as a natural antibiotic as well really good for blood pressure
very good for allergies especially of the sinus and their studies it's very anti tumor so you
might want to keep this around in the house in case you're running down run down with something
and I would also combine this with oregano oil you can have them those little pearls and olive
leaf extract for a really good antimicrobial natural remedy alright thanks for watching

today i'm going to talk about what actually is this rbgh or it's also called rbst they're both
the same thing okay so rbgh stands for recombinant bovine growth hormone okay what is this this is
a synthetic hormone that's mimicking a hormone that your pituitary produces now normally this
is released in very small quantities okay and the reason why this is used is dairy farmers use it
to increase milk production now in young calves it acts as a growth hormone but if you give it to an
adult cow that's lactating producing milk there'll be an increase in milk production now this
is approved by the fda in the u.s but it's not permitted in the european union or canada and many
other countries now i know this might be shocking to you but monsanto was one of the companies that
developed this product now here is the problem with rbgh cows that are treated with this hormone
develop a 50% increase in risk of getting lameness okay now what is lameness this is where uh the
animal has an abnormal gait or a stance they have problems with their hoofs and they have difficulty
walking as well another problem is there's a 25% increase risk of getting frequent utter
infections which is called mastitis there's also problems with infertility ovarian cysts in animals
birth defects and then farmers have to use more antibiotics for this mastitis okay so
here's my recommendation if you're consuming dairy make sure that it is organic because
not only will it not have rbgh but it won't have other synthetic hormones as well all right
thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

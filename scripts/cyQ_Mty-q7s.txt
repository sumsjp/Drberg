let's talk about the effects of fasting for your skin and especially wrinkles so
I am basing this video off of several studies I put them down below so you can
check them out but there's some interesting effects that fasting has on
your skin number one it delays something called
vascular cell senescence okay now what does that mean
it's aging of your vascular system so in young skin you have all this collagen
elastin which is the elastic protein that allows things to be very very
resilient and flexible you have good vascular system you have good hydration
and aging skin you're losing the hydration you're losing the nutrients
losing the elastin the collagen and the vascular system other than that you're
totally fine so number one you can delay the aging of the vascular system number
two it prevents oxidative stress now when you do fasting all sorts of interesting
things happen at the genetic level because you're mimicking starvation so
the body goes into this repair mode and your body starts building up its
antioxidant defense and mechanism so you get more antioxidants and that will
prevent oxidation or oxidative stress which is occurring from the environment
from food to sunlight radiation and other stresses with fasting you're
stimulating autophagy and that is a condition where your body is recycling
damaged proteins in the skin and the cell and the brain all over but
especially in the skin so you're actually able to recycle the old damaged
proteins and your body is actually making new proteins so it has an
anti-aging effect on your skin also if you do periodic prolonged fasting you
can stimulate the stem cells in the skin and that will help the body make new
skin as well now the other thing that fasting will do is increase dermal
vasculature there's a certain protein in the body that is stimulated that will
increase the blood vessels to the skin which brings nutrients
and oxygen because remember when you have aging skin you lose the blood
supply to the skin fasting will also stimulate something called IGF insulin
growth factor number one which will increase the growth of collagen so we
can increase more collagen there's a lot of other things that will happen with
certain enzymes that get triggered increasing more elastin which makes your
skin more flexible and look younger also your inflammation in your skin goes
down if you have some type of inflammatory condition less glycation
that's a situation where your proteins become very very damaged and rigid and
fasting will help decrease that effect as far as the best thing you can consume
for the skin especially for wrinkles it would be cod liver oil you can get that
in a liquid or in a capsule or in a tablet or in a little pearl the cod
liver oil has some amazing omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA and also gives you
vitamin D and vitamin A all four of those things are great for the skin if
you consume foods high in vitamin C sauerkraut leafy greens you will also
improve your skin and lastly vitamin E is really good for the skin too just so
happens that would be in leafy greens certain nuts in certain seeds alright
thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video so I wanted to say

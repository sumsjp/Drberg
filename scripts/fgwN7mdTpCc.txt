you know it's really amazing to me how many people still drink soda um they're just not
aware of what it can do to your liver and other organs um today we're going to talk about the
relationship between soft drinks and your liver normally your liver should only be five percent
fat when you have a fatty liver as in a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease situation
it's 60 to 80 percent fat so you're into almost your entire liver is filled with fat
which by the way is the leading cause of cirrhosis which is more of a permanent liver condition where
you get ascites where your gut starts protrude out you start to have all sorts of issues with
the heart high blood pressure with your memory and clarity of thought you can't think clearly
so that's something you want to avoid there is an interesting study that i'm going to
list down below that soft drinks was the only independent variable that predicts a fatty liver
by 82.5 percent so out of everything a person can do it's the soft drinks it's the soda
that will cause a fatty liver now when you read about the study the most common soft drink
would be coca-cola 40% diet coke 40% which i'm going to do a separate video on which is quite
fascinating data and then sweetened fruit juice
i mean why would you need to sweeten fruit juice they also have to flavor it which is wild it's 20%
but if we take a look at soda in general it's the high fructose corn syrup that does the most damage
about half of that is fructose and half of that is glucose and so glucose is dealt with
by all of your cells in your body but as far as fructose goes only the liver can deal with it so
when you drink your fructose you are massively overwhelming the liver and so the liver has no
choice but to convert it to triglycerides in the liver and then it spills off around the liver into
different organs it can get into your spleen into your pancreas into your bone marrow so it's pretty
damaging to the body organs so if you're drinking soda or you know someone that is drinking soda
definitely have them watch this video and switch to a stevia sweetened soda which actually has
no side effects hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your

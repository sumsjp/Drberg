let's talk about a condition called sarcopenia age-related muscle loss now the greek word for
sarcopenia means poverty of your flesh now sarcopenia is atrophy which is shrinkage
and degeneration of your skeletal muscles those are the large muscles in the body
as well as the quality of function of those muscles now normally sarcopenia starts with
two specific areas in your body the quadricep that's the front part of your thigh
and then the abdominal muscles you just start losing the abdominal muscles so it's difficult
to do a sit-up so then as it progresses you get a loss of the mass of muscle throughout the body
you also lose your appetite to a certain degree you have a risk of falling and many
times there's no symptoms until it becomes very very severe it's worsened by becoming immobile
just not moving it's worse than by nutritional efficiencies and definitely a lack of exercise
or motion there's two factors to look at when someone has sarcopenia number one
the initial muscle mass and number two the rate of muscle mass decline the loss of weight
and how rapid that occurs and that's really a good way to determine if you have sarcopenia
but here's the question what do you do about it the most important thing is to add exercise
routine regular consistent exercise it can dramatically slow the rate of muscle loss
especially if you do a resistance type training where you're working the whole body and you can
use your own body weight as well whether it's push-ups or sit-ups etc number two vitamin d
very very important minimally 10,000 ius but you probably want to go to 20,000 iu's next nutrient
which is very important omega-3 fatty acids which is in fish oils or cod liver oil and then number
four amino acids now i'm not biased on my own amino acids but keto essential amino acids has
a very unique blend of all the essential amino acids that you should take especially
leucine leucine has been found to stimulate uh muscle growth and prevent the loss of muscle so
it's really good for muscle atrophy and then we have something called h m b which is beta hydroxy
beta methyl butyrate and this compound based on several studies has shown to significantly
reduce the loss of muscle all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video

so i isolated about 13 things that have the potential to slow down your metabolism let's
go through them one by one number one age yes age slows your metabolism primarily through
a decrease in growth hormone now the good news is there's things that you
can do to increase growth hormone the most powerful thing is fasting
and when you do fasting you have the potential to increase growth hormone by 2 000 percent
the second most powerful thing that can increase growth hormone is exercise but the exercise has to
be intense one of the best exercises to increase growth hormone out of anything is sprinting
it's probably the most painful but short burst of high intensity with lots of rest as in high
intensity interval training is very very powerful to increase growth hormone number two menopause
if you're female and you're over the age of 50 51 52 you know exactly what i'm talking about
as you go through menopause something happens you have a shift the ovaries go into retirement and
the adrenal glands act as a backup to the ovaries and so what happens is you get a spike in cortisol
a lot of times when you go through menopause the body tends to fall apart because of this
high level of cortisol that's why it's very very important to take care of the adrenals
right before you go through menopause and also during and after of course but i have a lot of
videos on on what to do if you're going through menopause and i'll put those links down below
number three history of pregnancies going through a pregnancy not only creates a
lot of trauma on a female body but it raises estrogen and estrogen is a fat making hormone
if you wanted to help regulate estrogen you want to consume things like cruciferous vegetables
there's some products out there one being dim which is a concentrated cruciferous vegetable
but you want to avoid things that increase estrogen like dairy and flax seeds
both of those can increase estrogen and of course the big one would be soy too so that's
number three all right number four history of dieting the more you have went on a diet
the harder it is to lose weight down the road because what happens is you create an adaptation
by the body to slow down the metabolism so dieting incorrectly especially when you're
cutting calories and you're you're keeping your carbs high very very bad so keeping your calories
filled with nutrients just eating less frequently intermittent fasting not cutting calories though
that's not the best way to do it so just so you know just to prevent the slowdown of metabolism
you want to keep your nutrients very very high and not eat frequently and definitely do not go
in a low fat diet because you need that fat to support the endocrine system number five
a history of doing high carb diets what happens is you start generating
something called insulin resistance and when you have insulin resistance you have a high level of
insulin which is a thing that's going to completely block down your ability to lose
weight to fix insulin resistance and lower insulin you just need to watch my videos i have hundreds
of videos on this one topic i'll put some links down below number six chronic stress you can look
at stress as consuming sugar and that's really what it is because it turns things in your body
to glucose yeah so stress is like eating sugar and i have a lot of videos on what to do if you're
going through a lot of chronic stress and how to reverse that all right number seven hypothyroidism
ninety percent of all hypothyroidism is hashimoto's that relates to the immune system
it's not really a thyroid problem it's an immune system that's usually caused by some problem in
your gut so if you have hashimoto's you should definitely be on a probiotic you should be taking
selenium which is a very powerful antioxidant you should also be taking the vitamin d to drop the
inflammation the other versions of hypothyroidism involve having a problem with too much estrogen
because as you increase estrogen you shut the thyroid down also 80 of the thyroid hormone
t4 gets converted to t3 the active form through the liver with the help of bile
so if you don't have a gallbladder if you have a fatty liver where you're not making enough bile
you need to start taking bile salts that will help you convert
t4 to t3 all right number eight a fatty liver i just mentioned the liver helping you convert
t4 to t3 but a fatty liver can definitely slow down the ability to lose weight
from many different angles because if that liver is fatty you're not going to have the ability to
regulate certain levels of cortisol estrogen insulin and growth hormones so a fatty liver can
definitely keep you stuck i recommend choline as well as getting on healthy keto and doing fasting
because you can reverse a fatty liver number nine obesity the problem with that is the more fat you
have the more estrogen you're going to make and estrogen can keep you fat so over time as
you lose more fat it's going to be easier to lose weight because you don't have that estrogen that's
countering your ability to lose weight there are three hormones cortisol estrogen and insulin
that have the ability to block the seven fat burning hormones okay so it's very important
that we focus on those number 10 snacking frequent eating is the biggest killer
to your metabolism because every time you eat you stimulate insulin these people do
that are going on a diet and they're having these small frequent meals oh they're going to have a
heck of a time with their metabolism all right number 11 regular consumption of alcohol i know
this might be very unpopular but when you consume a little wine here and there unfortunately that
wine not only has carbohydrates but it can really block the liver's ability to help you tap into
burning fat developing ketones so let's say you have a glass of wine tonight don't expect to burn
fat for 48 hours now if you drink more wine that could go up to 72 hours so if you're doing this
like every other day or every third day it could be the reason why you're not losing weight
12. early childhood infections this relates to the person who said that they were always overweight
and then you ask them well what about when you're two years old they might say well i was skinny
i was saying i'll say what age did you start gaining weight they might say four what happened
just before that well a lot of times they'll say they had an infection a sinus infection asthma or
some type of problem that involved taking a drug a steroid an antibiotic or an inhaler or some
type of medication that somehow influenced your metabolism and they started getting fat ever since
that so i'm just pointing out because a person can have an alteration in their metabolism very early
on and a lot of times you don't connect the dots so that could be a problem and the last thing and
this is actually really important a lot of people are on medications and i'm not telling you to get
off your medications but maybe you want to get with your doctor and come up with the solution so
the dependency on medication is a lot less prednisone steroids anti anxiety antidepressant
medication antibiotics all will increase weight gain and it can slow your metabolism down all
right now the question is what do you do to speed it up for that check out this video right

let's talk about the 10 signs of a dying liver and i'm talking about end stage liver disease now
the liver is very very rugged it can regenerate but there's a point of limitation where you get
to the stage where it's it's almost impossible to reverse however if i had end-stage liver disease
i would do everything i could to try to reverse it now before i go into the end stage
signs let's talk about the first two symptoms that usually occur when you start having liver problems
number one it's malaise which is a difficult symptom to describe because it's the absence of
wellness you just don't feel quite right and then you have fatigue okay so those are the two first
symptoms but as things progress over the years you can get these indicators okay number one confusion
or disoriented okay that occurs because you have ammonia that is building up in the body and it's
going up into the brain this is because the liver is responsible for detoxifying ammonia and getting
rid of it number two ascites ascites is an advanced liver disease where you have a protein
albumin that is backing up in the blood and you're getting this fluid leakage into a sack around your
belly so it looks like you're pregnant i mean the best description is the guy in the beach
with the speedo with the pot belly that's the societies you can't see any fat on the person
except in their belly because it's not really fat it's a fluid-filled sac right in the stomach
and many people go to the hospital and they get it drained and then a week later it comes right
back because they didn't fix the liver so ascites is a sign of advanced liver disease number three
severe itching okay it's called pureitis this usually occurs because you have a problem with
your bile salts okay because the liver makes and controls uh the production of bile salts
so it kind of backs up into the system and even the skin and it can affect the sensory nerves
number four you start turning yellow the whites of the eyes turn yellow the skin turns yellow
that's called jaundice all right number five your appetite goes away personally i think this is
kind of a survival mechanism where you lose your appetite so you can start fasting i mean that's
just the theory i don't know if it's true but when you fast all sorts of healing occurs including
something called autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged protein and with advanced liver
disease you have a lot of fibrosis going on so no appetite is a symptom and number six you feel weak
you feel fatigued number seven you feel nauseated number eight you're gonna get bloating especially
every time you eat then we come to nine edema in your ankles and your legs especially on the left
side because that's where your liver is you'll get it on both sides but mainly on your left side
and lastly you'll get a lot of bruising going on because the liver is intimately involved
with vitamin k and there's a lot of other symptoms with liver disease but these are the top 10 signs
of an advanced liver disease situation so if you're enjoying my content which i hope you are

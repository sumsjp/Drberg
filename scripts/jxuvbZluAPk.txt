hey guys in this video we're talking about the best stretch for scoliosis now scoliosis is kind
of a curvature of the spine and this stretch is very very unique so let's pretend we're looking
from the back at a person and they have a kind of a C curve in the upper back and then it goes
to a C curve on the lower back so you would think that you would want to stretch this out by bending
into the left right it makes sense because these are tighter the muscles on the right are tighter
than the left but that's not how you do it what you want to do is you want to stretch the person
this way into the concavity okay and then the lower part you want to stretch them into the
concavity of the opposite way I'll demo this on someone but that way when you stretch these
muscles over here by going this way it will send an electrical signal over to the tight
side and it will relax the tight muscles and it allows for it to come back up now scoliosis is
usually if it's a adult it's kind of a permanent thing but you could do these stretches for a lot
of relief because people scoliosis have a lot of muscle tension their back is in a constant
spasm so definitely you want to do this so let me just show you how to do this on a person okay
guys I'm going to just do this demo I actually changed my shirt here you can see so let's just
pretend that she has a curve this way okay it's curving this way now you would think that you
would just need to stretch her back over this way and that's not how you do it what you want
to do is you want to get on this side and you want to get someone to do this and you grab
the upper back here you take your thumb and you press into the concavity just like this now you
could probably you know if you were by yourself what you could do you could take a foam roller
and put it on this side and lay like this so you actually exaggerate the curve okay now if it's
curved the other way on this side we press it down like this and again what you would do is
you would lay down with the little foam roller on this side to exaggerate make it worse because what
what I do is when we stretch the spine into where it's curved into the concavity when we stretch
that we're actually stretching the muscles on this side okay and this is sending little neurological
signals to this side to allow this to come up to relax because when you have a scoliosis and
it's curved on the side there's contact that's where you have the spasm which will tighten it's
pulling down so all we have to do is we have to it's kind of counterintuitive but we're going
to stretch this side it stretches stretch to this side it stretched this side right here it
sends signals and it starts to open this up so you're going to give the person a lot release
because it's not kind of necessarily straighten the spine out perfectly but it will help now if
you can do this when they're very young works really good I mean you can actually possibly
reverse scoliosis but normally people had it for a long time so you just want to give it first a lot
of relief especially because of all the muscle spasm to them so so remember wherever the curve
is so you would want to look on an x-ray or just look in the mirror and see which way it's going
or have someone feel the spine and it always stretch into where the curve is concave okay
don't try to straighten up and put your comments below thanks for watching hey guys thank you so

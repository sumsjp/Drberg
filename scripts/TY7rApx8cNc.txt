did you realize that 600,000 people die every single year of passive smoke or secondhand smoke
i mean they're not even smokers they're just around smokers 41,000 people die in the u.s
alone and so there's a little more than seven thousand people that die of actual lung cancer
and the rest almost 34,000 die of heart disease so the smoke doesn't just destroy the lung
it destroys the inside of your arteries around the heart and this cigarette exposure comes from
the smoke that comes off the cigarette and so the secondhand smoke comes from the cigarette itself
and from the smoke coming from the mouth of the person smoking the cigarette and so if we
compare this to people who actually smoke there's 7 million people worldwide that die from smoking
and there's about 480,000 of those deaths from the u.s alone about 10 times the amount of people
who die from second-hand smoke you see in my mind i thought that secondhand smoke was
not that dangerous and as long as you didn't smoke you're good but apparently i was wrong
and the reason why i'm doing this video is because i recently learned that the highest type of cancer
worldwide is lung cancer and the highest rate of cancer deaths actually involve the lung
and so the lung is at the top of the list and smoking is a major contributing factor
there are over 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke hundreds that are toxic and seventy that are
carcinogens chemicals that can cause cancer some of the most deadly carcinogens are number one pah
number two n nitrosamines then we have aromatic amines benzene aldehydes and ethylene oxide so
if you're around smokers if you live with a smoker just do whatever you can to make
sure they smoke outside or not around you and if you're a smoker this might be a good reason to
do whatever you can to quit all right guys talk to you later before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

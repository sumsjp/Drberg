let's talk about why it's better to give your kids more butter now as a child i craved
butter i remember as a child always consuming way more butter than anyone else in fact i would go
in the refrigerator and consume probably half a pound of butter in one sitting little did i know
i was very very deficient in vitamin k2 and my body just went to the source of where you get k2
in grass-fed butter you can also get it in cheese of course grass-fed it's in grass-fed meat it's
in egg yolks it's also in fermented veggies and so why is this vitamin k2 so important
for infants and children well because vitamin k2 is intimately involved in the development of your
facial bones okay your facial structure your teeth preventing cavities and premature calcification of
the cartilage in your at the end of your bones and so if you don't have enough vitamin k2
instead of having the normal cartilage that allows your bones to grow you can have a calcification
of that cartilage and end up actually just being shorter than you should be vitamin k2
is essential in protecting the heart keeping the calcium out of the arteries
and in the bones vitamin k2 is not just important for your facial bones and preventing cavity
it's good for everything connected to your teeth and even possibly preventing someone from getting
braces because they have good dental structure there's a really good book that i read it's called
nutrition and physical degeneration by westin price written in 1945 an amazing book written
by a dentist who traveled around the world looking for why certain traditional cultures had very good
health perfect teeth perfect dental structure in other cultures did not and he isolated this down
to what's called the x factor or activator x he called it he isolated the source to be in butter
fat organ meats animal fats from grass-fed animals and fish eggs well it turns out that this x factor
really is vitamin k2 which was discovered not long ago now animals that consume grass which is loaded
with vitamin k1 then convert the k2 into the animal fat or the milk which then is converted to
k2 from microbes in the gut and that can then turn into the cheese or the buttermilk so this is why
a mother who's breastfeeding gives the child a lot of vitamin k2 and the children that are
not breastfed are more likely to have a vitamin k2 deficiency now also the lactic acid bacteria
in your gut can convert k1 to k2 now vitamin k2 also activates the function of other vitamins
fat soluble vitamins like vitamin a and vitamin d which both are very vital in a child developing
their immune system and this is why in generations past we were given cod liver oil because it's a
perfect balance of vitamin d and vitamin a i think if you were to raise your children on not just cod
of oil but high quality grass-fed butter i think they would have very good dental structure i think
they would have minimal cavities i think they would have healthier hearts i think they would
have much stronger bones and so i just wanted to do this video to raise your awareness on the
importance of vitamin k2 and the source of that which would be grass-fed butter all right thanks
for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

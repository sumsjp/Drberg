you know i realized i never did a video on a selenium deficiency so here it is selenium is
a trace mineral which means you need some very small amounts of it but it's very very important
one of the functions is it helps you convert t4 to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone
so if you're deficient in selenium you're going to have hypothyroid
symptoms which be a whole series of things and i'll put a link down below if you're interested
dna synthesis so your dna needs selenium to be created if you're eating foods high in selenium
let's say you're doing some brazil nuts tuna shrimp sardines or sea and you have some of these
selenium deficiencies it could be because you have intestinal absorption problems or you had
a gastric bypass or you're older as you reach 90 years old you really become deficient in selenium
you just can't pull it in anymore also if you're on statins you will be deficient in selenium
selenium makes up a lot of different proteins and one big one is glutathione which is like
the master antioxidant and if you're deficient in glutathione definitely going to have some heart
problems the heart could even enlarge another symptom of a selenium deficiency is infertility
as well as number eight low sperm count number three myocardial necrosis what is that that is
actually breakdown of the heart tissue and this occurs when you also have an iodine deficiency
which by the way is actually quite common to have an iodine deficiency before muscle weakness
number five mood problems anxiety feeling confused number six fatigue probably because of this right
here and brain fog your hair needs selenium well guess what hypothyroid okay that can cause hair
loss as well and then i already mentioned low sperm so definitely don't forget about selenium
brazil nuts tuna shrimp sardines sea kelp other seafood and other fish that's from the ocean

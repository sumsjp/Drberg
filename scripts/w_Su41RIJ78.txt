so today we're going to talk about berberine okay
berberine is the next turmeric okay it is actually incredible
it's been thoroughly studied it's a lot of people know about it but they don't
know all the different things it can do some
hardcore research on a lot of things especially the cardiovascular system
it's a very powerful antiarrhythmic natural compound now berberine is a
phytonutrient in certain plants okay so it's not
necessarily a name of a plant and because the mechanism of
arrhythmias involve calcium berberine can decrease
the intracellular calcium which is one actual cause of
the heart going out of rhythm because calcium is an electrolyte if there's too
much calcium in the cell becomes toxic and it affects the
the electrical system in the heart it can also decrease
blood pressure it can increase the performance of the actual heart muscle
itself it decreases the risk of heart attacks
protects against ischemia and heart muscle this is a lack of oxygen
if there's some type of obstruction because there's a clogged artery that's
causing a lack of blood flow to the heart muscle
this can help it also it can alter potassium
channels now potassium is a mineral that protects
excessive amounts of calcium going into the cell
and this is why certain arrhythmias are actually caused by low potassium
because if you don't have enough potassium you can't protect against the
excess amount of calcium that builds up inside the cells
berberine can help as an anticoagulant so that can help reduce clotting number
two and this is a well-known benefit can decrease infectious diarrhea so if
you have an infection that's causing diarrhea
i would start taking berberine all right number three
it can act as a natural antibiotic okay which actually
explains number two it's also an immune stimulant it can help
boost your immune system number five anti-tumor
anti-cancer big time in fact there's just a lot of studies going on
using this berberine on tumors and cancer
which you know you don't hear about unless you actually dig in to find this
this data number six and this is actually a very important
benefit it has anti-diabetic properties it can
potentially decrease your blood sugars it can help with insulin resistance
making insulin and glucose more sensitive
so your blood sugars are going to be much better
there's been some reports that this will work just as good if not better
than metformin realize i'm not making any claims check with your doctor before
consuming this but you may just want to read the research yourself
all right number seven it can help decrease the effects of
caffeine caffeine can trigger arrhythmias
well berberine decreases the effect of caffeine
all right number eight it's anti-inflammatory
it's very very effective for anything that has itis
bursitis tendinitis arthritis and it's antiviral other than that
it probably doesn't work for anything else and i'm being very very sarcastic
this is the next turmeric i think it's a very powerful phytonutrient that i think
more people need to know about all right thanks for watching
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up

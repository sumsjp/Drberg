let's talk about abdominal pain that radiates to your back now you have several situations
you have abdominal pain that's more on the right side or the left side or the center that can
refer right into the back through here or it can come up through the left upper back here or the
right upper back through here so if it's going to the right side usually that's going to be more
liver because there's a problem either in the gallbladder the bile duct or the liver
and it could be a gallstone it could be sludge in here could be something that's obstructing
the flow that's backing up creating pressure hitting a little nerve right underneath your
diaphragm that's called the phrenic nerve that goes all the way to your neck so if you press
right here you're going to feel it up here and it can actually go up into the head through
here it could be a headache it can actually cause a spasm on the right part of your neck
and your trap and literally pull that vertebra to the right and pinch the nerve and that can
refer down to the right arm and also when people are diagnosed with fibromyalgia
it's usually on the right side it's really a problem with the gallbladder but if you have
pain in the center right through in here or to the left side that could be the pancreas
because the pancreas extends beyond the center sometimes all the way over here
and that potentially could be something called pancreatitis now the most common symptoms of
pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain we're talking about right in the center right over your stomach
area right here the second one would be upper abdominal pain that radiates okay it could radiate
around here or come up through here third one is upper abdominal pain that's worse after you eat
because you're straining the pancreas nausea tenderness bloating but you could also have
nausea tenderness bloating burping belching if you have a problem over here as well
now a couple main causes of pancreatitis which is inflammation of the pancreas is alcohol
gallstones or high calcium high calcium is not very common alcohol could be common but stones
having gallstones is a really big cause but those gallstones could be lodged not necessarily even
over here in the gallbladder but right in the pancreatic area right through in here
there's certain ducts that drain through here and if you obstruct that it's going
to balloon out and distend and cause pain and bloating and pressure now there's another cause
of pancreatitis which occurs 30 of the time and that is called idiopathic they call it idiopathic
pancreatitis what does that mean it means unknown cause so they don't know what causes it
but i found an interesting article that is talking about the cause of idiopathic pancreatitis the
actual cause of unknown cause pancreatitis which is very interesting and they mentioned that 79 percent
of the cause of the idiopathic pancreatitis is something called bilirary lithiasis or bile
sludge now what does that mean this word means a very very small gallstone that is not detected
on ultrasound or a cat scan you would have to stick a scope in the bile duct and look with
a certain machine to pick this up or it could be found when you're doing surgery but it's a
stone that's less than three millimeters okay so it's kind of like the the forming gallstone
and what happens when these stones start to crystallize they have calcium crystals they can
form sludge and obstruct these ducts but it's very difficult to diagnose them sometimes all you have
is nothing that shows up on a test other than a patient with bloating that pain that might radiate
to the back area so if we combine the percentage of this with this we can see that gallstones or
gall sludge is a big factor with pancreatitis not to mention with pain that goes to the right
side as well through this area right here so what is the solution well you first have to understand
what causes a gallstone or bile sludge what causes it is a super concentration of cholesterol and the
mechanism of that is this if you don't have enough bile to emulsify and break up that cholesterol and
keep it thinned it can actually form into a stone so in reality a stone a small stone bile sludge
is caused by a deficiency of bile and this is why one of the big treatments that you would get
for a stone or bile sludge would be oral purified bile salts so you would take that as a supplement
and that would help to thin the bile break up the stones and relieve the pressure this is also
very good for another condition called the sphincter of adi syndrome and really what that is
is that when the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct joins inside the small intestine there's
a little duct right here so if there's a blockage right here it's going to create a lot of pressure
they call that the sphincter body syndrome really it's just the same thing we have either a stone or
sludge that's obstructing this duct which is a little tube creating a lot of pain now not only
would you want to recommend purify bile salts but you want to also make sure that you correct the
cause of a bile deficiency and here's some causes low-fat diet because
fat triggers the release of bile so if you cut the fat down in the diet you don't release the bile
as well a high carb diet especially if you're doing fructose or refined carbohydrates
can also deplete your bile reserve this is why a diabetic has a higher risk of getting
gallstones because of the high amount of blood sugars they have if you have
a decreased microbiome let's say you had a series of antibiotics that destroyed your good bacteria
you might have a deficiency in bile because your microbes also make bile so you have the liver that
makes bile and your microbes so if you have liver damage that can be one source of a bile deficiency
or if you don't have enough microbes that can be another source and this leads to the next
thing a fatty liver can inhibit the production of bile high amounts of estrogen as in pregnancy
can alter the production of bile and limit it also high cortisol can inhibit the production
of bile this comes from stress it could also come from taking prednisone which is a steroid which is
usually for like a type of arthritis or an autoimmune disease now the best diet
to prevent this in the first place is healthy keto i'll put a link down below if you're new
to my channel and especially intermittent fasting because if you can actually not eat
so frequently and let your system reset and let the bowel concentrate by not eating so frequently
you can greatly help to avoid this problem the first place i put a link down below for those
of you that are new to my channel thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

hey dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about fat burning 101 some
of the basics this is very very important
another principle so when we're dealing with fat burning we're really dealing
with hormones and it's there's three hormones and this hormone is called
cortisol cortisol is your stress hormone okay so we have the stress hormone these
are fat burning hormones and these are fat making hormones okay so we got three
fat making six fat burning hormones and you need to know about both because it's
not just about burning fat it's about preventing these from working so
cortisol if the cortisol is too high and that comes from stress and by the way
nowadays compared to you know way back in the past probably the stress level is
a lot different but we're more sedentary we have a lot more mental stress and
we're not able to physically go out there and extract it so if you're being
chased by a tiger at least you're running away from the tiger versus
you're sitting behind a computer and you're under you know financial stress
your personal stress and you're not able to get that stress out so it's all I
think it's worse nowadays than before and cortisol is a dominating hormone it
will nullify all six fat burning hormones if it's too high and this is
why stress is a different thing than just changing your diet if you're on a
diet and it's not working and you assume that you know you're missing something
from your diet or maybe you're eating the wrong foods it could be that you're
eating the right foods you just have too much cortisol okay because you're your
body's accumulated stress and you're menopausal and that needs to be dealt
with I basically use a technique called acupressure to pull the stress out
because it's a hands-on manipulation to do that or you can do the do-it-yourself
version but what I do is I extract it and you'll find that the person can
finally relax and sleep and be very quiet on the inside now number two
there's another hormone called insulin
now insulin is triggered by sugar in the presence of insulin these are going to
be nullified okay insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars it lowers
sugar in the blood by converting everything to fat trigger trigger is
insulin okay number three estrogen how do we know if the estrogens high is your
period heavy do you have fibroids you have heavy cramping periods anything
related to a worsening of the mental cycle could mean that you have too much
estrogen estrogen is in the food supply growth hormones it's in hormone
replacement therapies and birth control pills soy triggers estrogen especially a
lot of these diets or prepackaged food like ideal protein all that is estrogen
and that could aggravate this and stop your ability to burn fat okay now if
your metabolism is low if you're over the age of 40 and it's not high this
really comes into play a lot more in that you would have to bring this down
so close to normal that even tiny amounts of this this or this can
completely wipe out any of your good works so let me just give you an example
all it would take is 80 calories of a carbohydrate a half a glass of wine a
bagel a doughnut a cookie you can walk this off in a mile but the insolent
effect with fat burning is close to 70 48 to 72 hours of no fat burning
yeah so this explains why you can't get away with even moderate amounts of
everything with this one you have to have it down to like near zero so you
can't do any sugar so people that eat a really good diet and have a little bit
here and there it's not good enough that's why it's not working because the
metabolism you have to be very extreme with this one and this one as well this
one isn't too bad but it's still an issue but it's it's less of an issue
it's the stress in the sugar that really makes it very difficult to tap in the
fat all right and then how do you know if you're you're not burning fat well if
you're craving sweets also if you're not sleeping that good if you're fatigued
you're not burning fat so if you're craving sweets and you're stressed and
you're not sleeping and you're tired you're not burning fat you're burning
sugar okay so I just wanted to give you this video just to impress upon you this
is to us the importance of keeping these two down to as low as possible and so if
you're trying to lose weight I would put way more attention on to avoid these
then to try to trigger these I'll see you in the next video

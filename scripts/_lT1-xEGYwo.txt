now i've talked about omega-3 fatty acids being in salmon
cod liver oil seafood fatty fish that type of thing
but you can also get it from microalgae which is basically
marine algae so let's talk about exactly what that is
you have all this sea vegetation called seaweed
it's a combination of plants and algae there's three main colors you have red
brown and green the brown is the sea kelp
sea kelp is the largest sea kelp can grow basically 150 feet
and it's grown only in salt water not in lakes or ponds it's grown on
rocky coastlines and there's no roots in sea kelp like
you would normally see in a plant that's on soil
it has something called hold fasts and it's sort of a structure at the bottom
of the plant that just attaches onto rocks
so it's in a fixed state but there's no roots
so it's going to get its nutrition through the leaf
as well as the sun it's called photosynthesis
and depending on how deep the sea vegetation is from the surface of the
ocean will determine the color the seaweed
what's very unique about marine algae is it's loaded with dha and epa these
are omega-3 fatty acids and they don't even have to
be converted like walnuts for example have ala that has to
be converted to epa and dha well you have active dha in epa
directly in marine algae you also have taurine which is great for the
cardiovascular system the central nervous system
the retina different parts of the nervous system
and it's hepatoprotective it's good for the liver
now marine algae is rich in vitamin a beta-carotene the precursor not retinol
vitamin b1 b2 b3 b9
that's biotin vitamin c vitamin e tons of potassium and tons of
magnesium and has a lot of phytonutrients like
carotenoids the biggest one which is very very
powerful called astaxanthin this is probably one of the most
powerful antioxidants some people get this one as a
concentrate in a supplement but it's anti-diabetic
anti-inflammatory anti-cancer so if you wanted a vegan source of dha
this might be a good option they're even using this as
a formula for premature infants so it's quite
powerful especially if you understand the importance of dha
epa which a lot of people are deficient in especially
infants and children before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's
not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the us

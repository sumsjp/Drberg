now i want to talk about why your kids need to be playing in the dirt more often but not really
the dirt the actual soil let's talk about the difference between dirt and soil dirt basically is
dead you have sand rocks and clay soil is actually alive because it has microbial life it has
bacteria fungus and the bacteria in the fungus make the nutrients available so i probably should
have named it why your kids should be playing in the soil all right so here's the reason you have
two parts of your immune system you have the innate part which you're born with your mother
has given you this immunity from her being exposed to microbes and all those antibodies
but then you have this other part of your immune system called the acquired
and this is the part of your immune system that it learns from being in your environment and so
if your child gets sick the best thing to do is to let them get sick and go through the infection and
make sure they have all the key nutrients allow the fever to be there to kill off the pathogen
and allow them to build up their antibodies that's the best thing you can do as compared to
shut off the immune system right away suppress the fever because what you're going to find out
is they're not going to develop your immune system as well and they probably are going to get sick
more often and when they're sick the duration of infection is going to be longer now there's
a huge connection between your brain and your gut and in your gut you have all these microbes which
play a very important part in your immune system it's the different microbes working together
synergistically to help pathogens from invading into the body and so i want to emphasize the
importance of your child being outside than being inside unfortunately recently many children are
spending way too much time inside they don't get that exposure to the germs in the soil that can
actually help greatly improve the immune system later in life there are some interesting studies
i'm going to put them down below that demonstrates that if a child is outside more than inside they
have a decreased risk in asthma allergies and even autoimmune diseases which is quite fascinating
children that are outside more in nature have much less inflammation and respiratory illnesses have a
much improved mental health status too both in cognitive function as well as mood and so it's
not just about having your children play in the dirt or the soil it's about having them
outdoors in the woods in nature on a farm in one study it was interesting it showed that
children that are raised in a farm are actually much healthier than their city counterparts and
there's an additional study which i'll put down below that shows there's much less depression
in children that are exposed more to nature being exposed to environments that uh involve trees
uh grass parks rivers lakes and even the ocean and then you have the topic of forest bathing
which i've done other videos on that supports the immune system apparently there's a certain phyto
chemical that is released from a pine tree that can greatly support your immune system and there's
a link between an improved immune system as well as improve cognitive and mood function as well and
one last study i want to mention that was quite interesting there was even an improvement in iq
with children that spent more time outside in the environment with more space more parks more trees
more grass versus children that were living in the cities where they didn't have that much exposure
to nature so anyway i wanted to create this video on the importance of getting your children outside
the house having them play in nature also please comment down below on how much time
did you spend outside when you were a child hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

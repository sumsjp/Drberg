i'm going to talk about the best exercise for recovery now there's three main types of movements
you have isometric movements which is holding a pose let's say for example you're in a push-up
position and you're in you're contracting your muscles but you're not lengthening or shortening
that muscle okay you're just holding that pose uh while your muscles are in contraction that's
called isometric then you have concentric this is where you're shortening a muscle okay you're
shortening a muscle while you're contracting okay then you have a concentric type movement
that's where you're lengthening the muscle while you're contracting so this would be concentric
and this would be eccentric okay where you're going down this way and there's many different
examples of eccentric you have it's called negative training walking down a hill you're going
to use a lot of eccentric type motions let's say you do a pull-up okay and then you let yourself
down very very slowly that would be a centric type motion or let's say for example you're
in a push-up position and you're letting yourself down you're not concentrically
pushing you're letting yourself down slowly so it's kind of a reversal of a certain motion
let's say you have these bands right at the gym this band is connected with your arm and you're
you're contracting this way right that would be concentric this would be eccentric letting it down
this way okay so it's kind of like a reverse type training there's a lot of benefits in this motion
actually more benefits than doing concentric type motions first of all it produces bigger
muscles faster muscles stronger muscles so let's say you're at the gym and you're doing bench press
let's say you have the weight up this high and then you bring it down really slowly this way
you're actually getting more benefit on this reverse motion and you're actually stronger
you can do more reps that way but they're going to have to spot you too because you're not going
to be able to do the other motion as much but you can get bigger muscles faster muscles and stronger
muscles by focusing on this right here also there's greater force in this negative eccentric
motion so you're going to have more disruption and that is what creates the delayed soreness even
more than this right here you're going to get the best repair possible so a lot of people in rehab
physical therapy chiropractic use this type of therapy especially if there's a problem with
tendon fascia or after surgery because there's way more strength in that direction and you can
scale it down where there's just a little bit of motion and you can slowly progress and improve
things on a nice gradual basis and see a lot of improvement in the tendon function this motion is
more efficient there's less mitochondrial adaptation and so it's really good for
sarcopenia this is a condition where people are getting older and they're losing their muscles
this is a safer type of an exercise and then we have osteopenia which is kind of a precursor to
osteoporosis a very good exercise to do for that also if you have like let's say tendon damage
from the shoulder or let's say you had you ripped your achilles tendon and you want to repair that
or your medial collateral ligaments on your knee this would be a great rehab type exercise
and what's interesting is this type of motion produces more metabolic rate more
improvement with inflammation it actually produces less inflammation which leads to a
whole series of additional very cool things so i just wanted to bring your awareness up
of this type of movement and not necessarily a full video on all the different exercises but
it's something that you might want to look into if you're trying to recover a certain part of
your body all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

someday when i have enough time and all
the stars align and everything is just
perfect
then i'll do it i used to be a
professional procrastinator on steroids
in college i said i'll eat healthy when
i graduate then i graduated and i said
i'll eat healthy when i get older and
this went on and on and on
today i want to talk a little bit about
procrastination willpower and
self-discipline you know i have
interviewed a lot of people who have
died in the past and i'm just blown away
how much discipline and willpower these
people actually had to be able to diet
for weeks and months and years
and just get a little bit of results
and do it with a lot of cravings and a
lot of fatigue
and a lot of hunger i mean the tolerate
those two things hunger and cravings
over a long period of time is just
remarkable so it is true that every time
you diet you tend to slow your
metabolism a little bit more and more
and more especially if that diet
involves low calorie and high
carbohydrate dieting in general tends to
go against survival right when you're
hungry your body should eat in your
craving you should actually eat what
you're craving right even the concept of
losing fat is anti-survival because fat
is all about surviving your body does
not like to give up fat it doesn't like
to lose the storage of energy so every
time a person tends to lose weight and
not succeed
it's going to be more difficult to
continue and do that same thing because
it actually is not working and so a lot
of times incorrectly
they will label themselves
as lazy a procrastinator or just that
they have no willpower when in fact this
is just not the case people are really
not procrastinators they're not lazy and
it's not that they have low willpower
what is true is they just been on the
wrong program when you're on the correct
program and it's working and i'm talking
about
actually losing fat
um you're gonna see results and you're
going to stick to it and so when you are
on a program and it doesn't work you
have to step back and really make sure
that you're on the correct program
because what's interesting is that if
you truly understand how to get into fat
burning um two things for sure
will happen okay it may not be weight
loss at first
but it will definitely be these two
things one is your cravings will go away
and number two
your appetite will go away you will no
longer be hungry why
because you are burning fat even when
you're not eating and so you're not
relying on the calories from food
externally
you're burning your fat 24 7. and the
purpose of that fat fuel is the storage
so you could exist between meals and not
be hungry i mean just compare being on a
diet okay with hunger and with cravings
versus not having any cravings or hunger
just think about how easy it would be
now the question is why might you not
lose weight if you're not doing it
correctly there's a really powerful
principle and if you've never heard this
before it'll be a really big thing for
you but maybe you've heard it before and
that is this you don't lose weight then
get healthy you have to get healthy
first before you lose the weight
the health comes before the weight loss
so the fact that you're losing fat isn't
necessarily
always equated to
getting healthy
let's say you have atrophy okay like
muscle loss
that has to be healed and that takes
some time
let's say you're healing something
called insulin resistance which is
really behind
a slow metabolism that process does take
some time to heal too but you have to
realize that the fact that your cravings
go away and your appetite goes away
means it is working so all of this boils
down to having a better understanding of
how fat is burned and what to eat and
what to do to trigger that and so if you
are new to my channel in this
information i put a link down below of
a document that will show you exactly
what to eat be able to achieve those two
things
rib cravings and rid hunger to make it
easy to do and to get healthy to
eventually lose the weight so many times
procrastination is just a symptom of
you're not getting results because you
don't have the correct plan okay so
that's number one and assigning yourself
the wrong diagnosis or someone else
assigning you you always get worse with
that so number two the next point i want
to bring up is the problem with time
um people that say well i just don't
have enough time to exercise or i don't
have enough time to implement the eating
it takes or preparing for the meals to
do this program well i'm going to
propose that your real problem is you
have too much time okay i don't know if
you've ever heard of parkinson's or law
okay i want to read it to you
work expands so as to fill time
available for its completion now what
does that mean basically
people adjust their pace
through the workload and amount of time
they have to finish it so in other words
if you have a lot of time you may feel
that with a lot of busy work there's a
few corollaries i want to mention
if you wait until the last minute it
only takes a minute to do
time is interesting because you we think
that we just don't have enough time but
if we really dissect a given day there's
a tremendous amount of effort done on
things that
are just a complete waste of time and i
think naturally if we just stay busy we
think we're getting something done but
is it really productive time not
necessarily so the couple things that
i'm going to recommend
to overcome this lack of time problem so
let's just say you have a goal to
implement exercise but you're maybe
waiting until someday when you have the
time which is probably never going to
happen so this is what i'm going to
recommend you do because a person will
always if they have a certain amount of
time they will automatically fill this
vacuum with all sorts of things very
similar to your house if you have extra
rooms or extra spaces all of a sudden
they become occupied with something the
same thing happens with your time so
this is what i'm going to recommend you
do right as you plan out your day you
have all these activities and
generally speaking most people kind of
weigh them on importance i would
recommend taking
the ones that relate to your health
style specifically exercise eating
correctly maybe preparing for those
meals
put those at the top of the list as the
most important
necessities don't treat those things as
extra things that you'll get to
if you have time put those at the top of
the list in relationship to everything
else so for example exercise the mindset
you should have is
i'm going to exercise as a priority and
if i have any time left in the day i
will do these other things like maybe
i'll eat maybe i'll get dressed maybe
i'll go to work so in other words the
more necessity that you create
for these very specific goals that you
tend to put off the more you're going to
get that done so this is going to take a
lot of um
ignoring um trivial things right and
pushing those distractions to the side
and really getting clarity
on your goals okay with healthy eating
with exercising or whatever you're doing
the more you get clarity and the more
that you define why you want this thing
the better you're going to be now as far
as me why i like exercise i like the
feeling of having endurance the ability
to go for a period of time i like the
feeling of strength i like the feeling
that exercise gives me after exercise
not necessarily during the exercise some
people in the exercise experience a
tremendous amount of pain right it's
very painful for them and it's also
extremely boring so they're going to
have to find something that is
not boring something that is different
that's not really like exercise maybe
they do some type of dancing or some
type of fitness that is they're
interested in
some people exercise to lose weight and
get fit to reshape their body
and
maybe they don't know
that
diet is responsible for 85 percent of
the results and exercise is only 15
and their diet is not that great and so
they're trying to achieve this goal
without knowing that piece of data or
they might not know what is really
responsible for the stimulation of
muscle growth and that's intensity and
so the way they're exercising is just
not intensive enough it's kind of like
this moderate type of exercise where
they have to do like 12 different sets
it's time consuming and they don't
really uh get results because they don't
understand that it's the intensity they
should be doing a different type of
exercise and i'm going to put that link
down below so it is about having the
correct information and this especially
applies to our bodies
but i don't tend to follow what everyone
else is doing because usually that is
incorrect information i like to study
those people that are very successful in
certain things and not necessarily study
or follow what mainstream or
conventional is doing because i find
usually the truth is in the opposite
direction so anyway i wanted to sort out
in this video a couple things that i
think will help
you overcome procrastination and
increase your discipline and give you
more willpower now if you haven't

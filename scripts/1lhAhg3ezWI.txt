hi guys in this video I want to share with you some amazing benefits of in a minute fasting
okay in a minute fasting can act as a mild stress that triggers cellular adaptations and changes
mainly in the brain but other places as well now we already talked about the benefits of fasting
with your midsection your weight your performance with exercise and the protection of your muscles
so they don't become weak or destroyed but check this out it will increase this factor in the brain
called brain derived neurotrophic factor okay what is that thing something in the brain that
will increase the survival of existing neurons okay those are brain cells and it increases the
growth of new neurons in the hippocampus which is that part of the brain that gets destroyed
when you have Alzheimer's and that structure in the brain helps you it's like a GPS allows you
to locate yourself in time in space so if you're going outside like where did I park where to put
my keys where am I going I can't follow directions that type of thing that would be a destruction of
the hippocampus and in fact insulin resistance will create problems with that structure it just
deprives it of oxygen and starves it as well and then also it's involved in memory and learning
long-term memory short-term memories so this is something if you know someone that has parked
Alzheimer's symptoms or dementia you need to put them on this immediately protects against amyloid
plaque ingen abrade and Alzheimer's patients it protects against that it also will increase
something called autophagy which is like the many garbage disposals of the cell which allows the
toxins to come out of the body a lot easier and dispose of them because patients with depression
and Alzheimer's have a lot of excess toxic waste in the nerve cells and the in the cells in general
so this will make it very very clean intermittent fasting also will increase insulin responsiveness
and so again if you have instant resistance prediabetes this is what you need to do to
actually fix that alright put your comments below tell me what you think hey you probably already

today we're going to talk about
trace minerals what is a trace mineral
well trace minerals are part of the
periodic table which has all the
elements that make up the physical
universe so all the matter that makes up
things whether it's the soil the plants
human bodies animals everything is made
from elements and you have these things
called trace elements which are
minerals needed in very very trace or
small amounts very tiny amounts another
term for that would be micro
minerals versus macro minerals which you
need
in larger amounts like usually above 100
milligrams so trace minerals are needed
in tiny amounts definitely below 100
milligrams but sometimes even in the
microgram amounts so they're very very
tiny the macro minerals make up about i
don't know three to four percent of your
entire body and the micro minerals make
up only like point zero two percent now
just because we need trace minerals in
very very tiny amounts doesn't mean that
they're not extremely important they are
if a plant if an animal if a human is
missing just one trace mineral and they
have all the other trace minerals there
could be huge side effects so we're only
as strong as our weakest link now i want
to give you another definition of the
word organic typically when people think
of organic they think of without
pesticides but there's another
definition of the word organic and that
has to do with a plant-based mineral so
you have inorganic minerals in the soil
like elements like whether it's iron
magnesium
potassium and these basically come from
rocks in the soil so certain
microorganisms like fungus
release acids that then dissolve rocks
then then allow these tiny minerals to
be absorbed by the plant's roots so we
have this nice exchange between
minerals and carbs and proteins so the
plant's roots then pull up this mineral
and convert it from an inorganic mineral
to an organic mineral so now the
plant-based mineral is in a certain form
that's very easy to manipulate
and then when you consume minerals from
plants they're very easy for your body
to digest and assimilate versus eating a
teaspoon of dirt okay these are
inorganic elements that are not easily
absorbed by our body so we need them in
a form
that
is easy to break down and utilize when
people think about trace minerals they
think
nails
skin
hair right
but they don't realize that
trace minerals go way way beyond that we
have the big function of
acting as a co-enzyme or a co-helper
element so trace minerals help make
enzymes okay and there are thousands and
thousands of different types of enzymes
that our body needs
for various things
that have nothing to do with digestion
that may have something to do with
growing hair they might have something
to do with pumping certain fluids to the
body or part of your immune system
killing off pathogens
i mean the list goes on and on and on
and so to make these proteins you need
certain trace minerals you also need
trace minerals many times to make
vitamins
like let's take b12
b12 needs cobalt okay as the trace
mineral
and without cobalt in the soil you can't
make b12 and you become anemic so we
need the complete package of trace
minerals without anything missing let me
first explain some of the macro minerals
first okay just so you can differentiate
the two like potassium for example we
need massive amounts of potassium that
would be a macro mineral calcium sodium
chloride magnesium phosphorus
sulfur those are all minerals we need in
large amounts okay now the micro
minerals would be like iron
zinc iodine selenium copper chromium
boron malignant try to say that five
times so that would be a short list of
trace minerals there's many others but i
wanted to kind of talk about the common
ones now when someone is deficient in a
trace mineral it is hard to
differentiate
what trace mineral is causing that
deficiency because just one trace
mineral could be involved with hundreds
of different
enzymes like zinc for example and so if
your body has a small amount of zinc it
might use it in the most important
functions but not in a lot of the other
functions that you might not have any
connection that that's associated with
because how do you feel that your dna is
not being properly manufactured or how
do you always feel that all the
neurotransmitters aren't in the perfect
balance it's difficult so it's just
another reason why you just need to eat
healthy to include all these trace
minerals
let's first talk about iron okay
you need iron in very small amounts like
between 8 and 15 milligrams per day as a
requirement
especially women that menstruate they
need more because they're losing iron on
a regular basis but
over 2 billion people on this planet are
deficient in iron that's incredible
that's a lot of people but iron is
involved in oxygen transport it's also
involved in the storage of oxygen in
your muscles
it's involved in producing energy making
dna
supporting the immune system making
myelin that the stuff that surrounds the
nervous system
also in making neurotransmitters okay
that's what iron does iron is very
plentiful especially in the form that
you need in red meat organ meats
shellfish okay seafood
nuts seeds
and chocolate iron also is absorbed
easier in the presence of vitamin c
so if you're gonna
have a steak in a salad for example you
have this red meat which has a great
source of iron and your salad has a good
source of vitamin c that would be a
perfect
meal to help maximize the absorption of
iron now if someone's anemic
some of the best supplements that you
could take would be like a maybe a
grass-fed bovine
iron supplement
a grass-fed bovine liver okay
extract because liver is a really good
source of iron or you could do a
grass-fed uh bovine spleen extract okay
that's another really good
supplement for iron versus some of the
supplements that you find which i won't
mention any brand names but they have
the form of iron in an element you know
much like you would you would find in
the soil not a good type of iron that
you want to take because
the side effects you'll find that your
digestive system will be hurting so i
would never recommend taking this iron
supplement unless it's like either a
food base or it's something like liver
or spleen extract things like that now
tannins and tea and even coffee can
block the absorption of iron but the the
big reason why
so many people are deficient in iron is
because of phytates or phytic acid and
that's in grains because of such a large
population on this planet consumes
grains
and so-called healthy grains that phytic
acid blocks the absorption of iron
making people very anemic now there's
other causes of deficiency too let's say
for example people have an infection
with a parasite and they have
bleeding and things like that that can
be a problem with iron but the big thing
is the phytic acid because they're
eating grains
so some of the symptoms of an iron
deficiency would be
anemic that you're going to be tired
kind of washed out
lethargic
hair loss you're going to feel colder
you can have this condition called pica
which you're craving dirt
or chalk something like that or even
clay
or low libido other than that you'd be
totally fine
all right let's go move on to zinc
as far as how much zinc you need between
8 and 13 milligrams very small amounts
31
of the world's population
is deficient in zinc
according to certain uh reports now
that's a lot of people now
can you guess why they're deficient in
zinc if you've guessed exposure to
phytic acid you are correct
it's the grains
grains are loaded with phytic acid which
then blocks certain minerals iron
zinc
calcium things like that now right now
i'm living on a farm and we have animals
we have chickens
pigs with sheep we have goat and i'm
feeding them some non-gmo grain what i
do is i soak those grains
for three days it gets rid of all the
phytic acid and these animals thrive
they do great so there's no phytic acid
so they get this maximum absorption of
trace minerals
including zinc and iron and calcium
not to mention the enhanced
b vitamin profile as well so but for
humans i don't recommend consuming
grains all right zinc
probably the most
important trace mineral
ever because it's involved in hundreds
and hundreds of different enzymes it's
involved in making dna
involved in making amino acids
it's very very important for your immune
system
making t cells uh bone health producing
sperm wound healing
uh
helping in the regulation of
inflammation especially in your lungs
if you're deficient in zinc you can get
an ulcer you can have a loss of taste
loss of smell loss of appetite it can
affect your mood where you're very
irritable it can also increase your
susceptibility of getting certain
viruses okay
of the lung it can really crash your
libido and the type of zinc that you
want um the the type that's easily
absorbed is in red meat
this is why vegans are usually deficient
it's an organ meats
shellfish so we come back to the
shellfish shellfish has
pretty much all the trace minerals
because it's from the ocean right all
right and then pumpkin seeds do have a
good amount of zinc
as a side note when you consume zinc
with protein
you're going to get more absorption all
right let's move to iodine next iodine
very important you need about 120 to 220
micrograms okay not milligrams
micrograms
and this is another trace mineral that a
lot of people are deficient like 1.9
billion
people on this planet are deficient in
iodine and in 36.4 percent of that group
is children okay so if a child is
deficient in iodine uh they'll have a
diminished uh intelligence they have a
lower cognitive uh function their growth
is stunted so it's very very important
for both pregnant women and small
children to get enough iodine okay
now if you're consuming food from the
ocean you're going to be good to go like
seaweed shellfish
sea salt things like that now eggs have
iodine as well beef liver has good
amount of iodine but if you don't have
iodine your thyroid can't work so you
can't make thyroid hormones when you
talk about the thyroid hormone like t4
or t3 you're talking about the the
number of iodine molecules in that
hormone okay t4 is the inactive version
t3 is the active version
and so you need iodine to make these
hormones and if you don't have enough
iodine your metabolism is slow you get a
lot of pregnancy complications okay
still birth you might get miscarriages
things like that
iodine also regulates
an excess amount of estrogen so if you
have too much estrogen in the body
you take enough iodine you can help
regulate that
a really good indication for the need of
iodine would be fibrocystic breast
ovarian cyst
iodine will help get rid of both of
those conditions also if you're cold on
the cold side
um you need more iodine usually all
right let's move to selenium selenium is
another trace mineral needed in small
amounts like 40 to 70 micrograms
over a billion people are deficient in
selenium and so selenium is needed in
certain proteins like the selenium
protein enzyme
which helps to detoxify mercury also
selenium is involved in dna synthesis
and decreasing inflammation because it's
involved in antioxidants okay selenium
is also needed for reproduction it's
needed in the conversion from t4 to t3
without selenium you can't convert the
thyroid hormones so even though you have
enough hormone there it can't be
activated selenium is a really powerful
antioxidant for your liver okay
and how do you get selenium seafood
shellfish organ meats
seems like those three types of foods
are at the top of the list for trace
minerals
also brazil nuts one brazil nut a day
will give you enough selenium uh beef
has selenium eggs
and of course beef liver is loaded with
selenium which is an organ meat which
i've already mentioned okay myalgia
that's muscle pain in the lower part of
your body is an indication that you need
selenium cardiomyopathy that's a heart
problem
you need selenium for that it's an
antioxidant
if you're lethargic sometimes you're
deficient in selenium and if you have
these white nail beds that means you
need
selenium all right let's talk about
chromium you need between 15 and 45
micrograms not milligrams of chromium
every single day chromium enhances
insulin and it's involved as a cofactor
in the production of insulin so it's
really important in blood sugars and
when you're on a high carb diet the need
for
chromium goes way up because
high amounts of sugar deplete you of
chromium you're going to find chromium
and vegetables beef ham egg yolks fish
yeast
keep coming back to that
if you're deficient in chromium you have
a greater tendency to have insulin
resistance a slower metabolism
polycystic ovarian syndrome why because
insulin is involved in polycystic
ovarian syndrome peripheral neuropathies
why because peripheral neuropathies are
involved with blood sugar issues also
chromium helps to
keep cholesterol out of the arteries
okay so if you don't have enough
chromium
cholesterol can tends to stay in the
arteries
why because insulin is involved again
and insulin and chromium tend to work
together let's talk about copper copper
is needed in small amounts as well like
900 micrograms that's under one
milligram okay
now copper works with iron to make red
blood cells copper also works with zinc
as a part of your immune system and many
other functions now copper deficiency is
very very rare unless you're in a
hospital after getting surgery when it's
very very common so apparently we need
copper in the healing process
copper is needed for connective tissue
it's needed for your blood vessels
because it's needed for collagen um
production
white blood cells need copper
and copper acts as a dimmer switch
within your neurons and so they help to
modify the overactivity of nerve signals
and if you're deficient in copper you're
going to be
fatigued you're going to be weak you're
going to be frequently sick
you're going to have
poor memory you're going to have poor
vision you're going to be on the cold
side
and you can get copper in many different
things beef liver shellfish cashews
mushrooms
chocolate
and avocados
so now that you know a little bit about
trace minerals if you haven't seen my
video on electrolytes that's the next
one to watch check it out it's right
here

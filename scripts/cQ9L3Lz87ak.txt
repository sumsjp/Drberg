hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about tinnitus
ringing in the ears okay I'm gonna teach you a technique
it's not mine I didn't develop it it's I've found some data on the web by
a guy by the name of dr. Jan Strydom okay so it's he developed it I don't
know where he got it from but it seems to be pretty successful for tinnitus
okay it's called the finger drumming
technique maybe you already saw it but I'm gonna alter the technique just a
little bit I mean you can try both ways but I think this way works a little bit
better it involves kind of a stimulation of the eighth cranial nerve the eighth
cranial nerve comes out of the brainstem deep into the skull and it's called the
vestibular cochlear this is the nerve that affects hearing and if there's a
problem with that nerve you can have ring as well okay now in my other
techniques that you probably watched or maybe you haven't a lot of the principle
of getting rid of chronic pain for example is to work on another part of
the body okay because you have this kind of the stuck energy that it just keeps
hurting over and over and to release it you don't work on that air you work on
the mirror-image side this this involves the same principle so you're gonna be
working on the back part of your skull that matches this cranial nerve at the
level of the brainstem where it comes out okay and the first thing you're
gonna do is you're going to take your fingers like this on the back of the
skull and you're gonna just take your pointer fingers right on the middle
finger and then just flip them like this and I'm gonna demonstrate that just like
this okay you're gonna do it like this okay now here's the thing the location
is very very important if we take a look at where this nerve exits on the
brainstem it exits at the level of where the ear is right here with a hole in
your ears right here if you draw a line and the back part you're going to go
right around the ridge of that what's called the occiput Ridge it's a little
like if you take your fingers and you just feel on your skull it'll actually
go and then it just sinks into your neck right well there's a
little Ridge there the bottom that Ridge is at the level of where your ear is
that's where you're going to be thumping or or flipping your fingers and tapping
okay right at that point so you're gonna take your middle finger and go just
above it and then you're gonna let your first finger kind of flip off and
together stimulate that point kind of fairly close to the midline okay so the
first thing you do is you're going to rate the severity of the ringing or
hissing noise okay so let's just say 10 is like off-the-charts really really bad
one there's no no ringing at all okay so you
want to first rate it so go ahead and do that right now what number you go let's
pretend you have a five okay so now we're going to do this technique he says
to do it for about forty to fifty times I'm gonna suggest you start up with
doing 20 times and I'm gonna tell you why in a second so you're gonna do it 20
times so you're gonna do this technique and just flip your finger in kind of
pulse right at the level of your Ridge on the occiput okay you're gonna do that
for 20 times then you're gonna rate the severity so it was a 5 let's say now
it's a 4 okay so then you're gonna repeat this procedure do it 20 more
times ok now reevaluate how is it now it's a 3 ok do it again and you keep
repeating this until it's completely gone now you may find that you have to
do this 4 or 5 times to get rid of it completely there is a chance that it
might not work at all so if it doesn't work the first time it's probably not
gonna work at all but if it's gonna work it's gonna work right away okay so
that's the simplicity of it but you want to keep repeating this and I would do
this every single day until it stays gone ok
so go ahead and try that put your comments down below

let's talk about the relationship between your hair and trace minerals if
you're deficient in trace minerals you could be losing your hair and the
question is why well what is a trace mineral a trace mineral is a mineral
needed in very very trace or tiny amounts and these trace minerals are
helper nutrients in enzymes and proteins but I think a lot of people don't
realize what that means enzyme or proteins you know you think about
protein as your hair nails skin muscle ligaments tendons right well in your
cells you have very very tiny biological machines which are proteins and they're
enzymes so in other words those little proteins do the work of the body they
build certain body tissue they break things down they're involved in all
sorts of biochemistry and they're quite amazing if you actually see what they do
they're little worker bees doing all the work of the body so there's some really
key trace minerals involved with your hair one is iron if you're deficient in
iron and you're anemic one of the big symptoms is hair loss because you need
iron to build strong hair some of the best foods for iron or red meat liver
things like that and then we have silicon silicon helps the structure of
your hair if you're deficient in silicon you're gonna find the integrity of your
hair is not going to be that great it's not going to be strong it'll break the
ends will break also silicon is very very important and then the strength of
your nails and then you have zinc which is probably one of all these one of the
most important trace minerals because it's involved in so many enzyme
reactions if you're deficient in zinc you could develop male pattern baldness
okay then we get copper copper works with zinc copper is involved in the
color of your hair so if you're losing copper you could
actually go gray or even white and also copper is a part of
the enzyme that's involved in vitamin C and the vitamin C complex the name for
that as tyrosinase so copper is involved in building collagen just as vitamin C
is necessary to build collagen and your hair is collagen then we have selenium
selenium is one of the most powerful antioxidants it's a trace mineral and
it's really good for the thyroid it's also involved in converting t4 to t3
that's necessary for that conversion it's also involved in countering some of
the reactions that occur with the thyroid if you have an autoimmune
condition where you're having a lot of free radical damage well this comes in
there and chills everything out because your body is making this extra hydrogen
peroxide which is very oxidative and selenium can calm that down so these are
the five most important trace minerals for your hair in protein synthesis which
is actually just making the protein the length of the hair the integrity of the
hair so it's strong that doesn't break and the actual growth of the hair now if
you have alopecia which is an autoimmune condition you have different patches of
hair being a lost that could be a vitamin b3 deficiency it could also be a
biotin deficiency I did a video on this specifically biotin is in all the foods
but your microbes make biotin so usually it's either going to be you don't have
enough microbes to make biotin or there's some gut damage that you're not
absorbing in the intestines so you become biotin deficient and this is why
a lot of people who take high levels of biotin their hair actually comes back
it's a type of B vitamin and then we have vitamin E a very powerful
antioxidant very similar to selenium as far as what it can do
handling all the free radical damage that can occur from autoimmune
conditions and even hair loss in general vitamin A has to do with supporting the
growth of the follicle that it helps stem cells activate the growth of hair
now if your hair is too dry then you may need some essential fatty acids
it could also be that you're not able to digest the fat because either you have a
gallbladder problem or you're missing a gallbladder or you need more bile salts
and one less thing about that let's say you don't have enough microbes you're
lacking flora good bacteria and you're not able to recycle the bile that could
be why your hair is drying up because you're not actually able to absorb the
essential fatty acids all right so now you understand the relationship between
trace minerals and other nutrients and your hair thanks for watching

now typically when you think of herbs for the liver you think they're very very beneficial
and most herbs are very healthy for the liver especially those that are
bitter there's all sorts of phytochemicals that support the liver a herb that's very
important would be milk thistle or stinging nettle root two very very powerful herbs
there's a lot of plants that are good for the liver as well dandelion greens is very good for
the liver and there's many many more but there are herbs that are a bit toxic to your liver
in large amounts but the six herbs i'm going to talk about um don't affect everyone but a certain
population they do so i want to bring them up to increase your awareness so the first one we're
going to talk about is kava kava now kava kava is great for relaxation it's good for stress
and if you're consuming it traditionally you're going to consume the roots you're not going to do
the stems or the leaves and unfortunately certain nutritional companies to save money they'll use
the whole plant and that's when you get into trouble because the stems and the leaves are
are a bit more toxic to the liver than the roots now the main thing with kava kava is that
it should never be taken with drugs or alcohol because it will tend to hold
that chemical in the liver a lot longer and that's really what creates a lot of the damage
so it would be like you consuming alcohol but then you can't release the toxic effects of alcohol so
that would be a situation so traditionally people that use kava kava they would chew the
root and then they would spit it out and your saliva has certain enzymes to kind of deal with
the toxicity that would affect your liver so fortunately we don't do that anymore all right
the next one is shepparel and that has been used for over 50 different elements including
cancer asthma tb skin problems you name it now this herb is banned in many different countries
and it's been known to be very poisonous even indicated by the fda but you can still buy it my
recommendation is to choose some other safer herbs because this potentially could create a problem
in certain people if you have too much and this herb also affects the liver's ability to detoxify
so we don't want that and so the next herb would be called germander now this herb acts
as an antiseptic antidepressant diuretic it's even used for obesity and weight loss but unfortunately
can cause hepatitis and liver cirrhosis in a certain percentage of the population so this
is another one that i would probably avoid all right next one is in pila this was used in africa
in fact the word for impila means health in Zulu so it's used for stomach problems infertility
coughing in worms but it can be highly toxic to the liver in the kidney in certain people
and so this is another herb i probably would not recommend and number five red clover which has
been used for menopause and also many other ailments but the problem with red clover in
certain species it can create a toxic liver and that includes humans now what is interesting it
can actually improve the thyroid but at the same time it can increase liver enzymes so
when you're researching herbs you have to really make sure that you get one that doesn't give you
another problem all right and number six st john's wort which is very effective for depression now
i actually recommend this herb if someone has depression or anxiety because it's extremely
effective but not if you're taking medications because there are so many complications with other
medications especially psychiatric drugs that you would have to take this under supervision so if
you're not taking any medication or drugs i think it'll be okay because it's very very effective
but even though it might not cause liver damage directly it can create indirect damage because how
it concentrates other medications and last note on this um saint john's wort i mean think about
what what competition that this goes up against we're talking about a the major anti-anxiety
anti-depressant medication so again i also don't know how unbiased some of this research is against
saint john's wort and so my recommendation is if you're taking other medications get supervision

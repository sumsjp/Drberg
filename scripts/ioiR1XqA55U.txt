let's talk about leptin leptin is mainly known as an appetite hormone so the more
you have the less hungry you are but leptin also has a huge immune
function that I want to talk about and as a side note the Greek word for the
word leptin means thin because of the suppression of the appetite when you
increase leptin the hunger goes away because there's a signal from the fat
cell to your brain specifically the hypothalamus telling the brain we have
enough nutrition or food but when leptin is low you are hungry leptin is made by
your fat cells and the intestinal cells but here's a problem chronically high
levels of leptin start causing what's called leptin resistance now this is
very similar to insulin resistance where you have this high level of insulin
produced by consuming a lot of carbohydrates and what happens over time
is your receptors start to downgrade and now you can't absorb that hormone
anymore same exact thing happens with leptin
high levels of leptin over a long period of time kind of desensitize the receptor
and now you don't get a lot of absorption of that hormone here's the
problem the feedback loops that are supposed to go back to the fat cells
really don't because of the blockage of the receptor so the fat cell keeps
making more and more and more but you have the situation where you have all
this leptin but it's not working so we have symptoms of a leptin deficiency
starving and in excess as well and another purpose of leptin is to suppress
both parts of the immune system to calm inflammation down so people that don't
have enough leptin have higher risks of getting an autoimmune problem because
they have way too much inflammation and when you have a lot of inflammation in
your body your immune system is actually weaker so the reason why I wanted to
talk about leptin is to mention that the way to fix this is the exact same
procedure as you would to fix insulin resistance
and that is doing keto and intermittent fasting these together over a period of
time will solve insulin resistance and leptin resistance which will also help
your immune system greatly so when people ask you what some of the benefits
of keto and intermittent fasting are you can tell them it has a huge benefit on helping
suppress inflammatory conditions as well as supporting a healthy immune system
thanks for watching

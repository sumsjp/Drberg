today we're going to talk about what to do if you stalled when you're doing
intermittent fasting now this topic comes up quite often when
i do my live show on friday mornings so i'm just going to create this one
video to cover all the basics now
our bodies have been evolving for hundreds of
thousands of years in relationship to starvation
starvation is a risk to your survival human bodies have gone through a lot of
starvation and so they have developed and have
adapted certain mechanisms to help them survive so
they're in your body and they're waiting okay when you stop eating so
when you start fasting or you do fasting for a period of time
that sends signals up to the brain that food is scarce
so we're going to get some hormone adaptation
our cells are going to become more efficient you're going to start to
develop this condition called autophagy where
your cells are efficiently recycling damaged proteins and giving you new
proteins your body is taking the resources it has
and becoming just very very frugal and very efficient and you're
going to lose less nutrients and you're going to have
certain things that preserve your muscle from being used as fuel
the body's going to start tapping into its fat
when you go in a weight loss program when you want to lose weight
that's very very anti-survival because your body does not like to lose
anything so this is where the problem is knowing how to do it
correctly and of course they will tell you that one pound
of fat equals 3 500 calories and all you have to do is
eat less calories and increase your exercise
and you're just going to lose weight but we know that that doesn't work because
the hormones start to slow down the metabolism so
the rate at which you burn fat is different from one person
to another in fact you may even know people who eat
not even close to as healthy as you are and they're losing weight but you're not
so we're going to talk about what to do first thing that happens when you go on
a low carb diet or you fast as you start to get rid of your glycogen
reserve okay that's stored sugar in the liver
and with this stored sugar you have a lot of
water so you're gonna drop probably a good
eight to nine pounds right off the bat and just don't don't confuse that with
actual fat because that's it's going to be water especially
initially the key to overcoming a stall or a plateau
is really understanding what you're trying to do the key hormone that keeps
you at a stall and keeps you plateaued is
insulin right there insulin is the switch that if it's high you're not
losing fat if it's low you are going to be burning
fat so this is what you need to focus on in
other words out of all the actions that you could do
the question is what is going to reduce insulin the most
and the second most and the third and the fourth and the fifth
so i put these in order so you can kind of use it as a little checklist
one of the best ways to know if your insulin is going down
is with appetite if your appetite is going away insulin is coming down okay
if you still crave if you're still hungry we know you're not tapping in the
fat so this is a real simple way rather than
even doing a test just go by your appetite if you cannot
go for a period of time without getting hungry we know the insulin
is still a little bit on the high side and you probably still have insulin
resistance if you're new to my channel definitely
make sure you watch the video on insulin resistance because you need to
understand that as well so what do you do is the most important
thing to attack this problem you fast
longer keep going longer and longer and then when you eat
you add more fat to the meal to be more satisfied to go longer
okay so the longer the fasting the less you're going to trigger insulin because
insulin is triggered not just by carbohydrates it's triggered by eating
so we want to fast longer so just keep working on that
and the rule of thumb is do not eat unless you're hungry
okay so people eat when they're not hungry don't do that
go as long as you can i always recommend consuming nutrients when you're fasting
very very important simply because you don't know if you're deficient and most
people are deficient in nutrients and so if you're taking vitamin
supplements just getting nutrients without the calories
then you're going to get the benefits of fasting without any type of side effect
so that's what i recommend all right number two
lower your carbs lower than they are right now
try to get them as close to zero as possible because
carbs are what keeps the insulin elevated
also look for hidden carbs it could be msg
in certain foods that can actually affect insulin which is not a carb but
it's a chemical that can stimulate insulin also
a lot of the keto treats in the keto foods now have maltodextrin or
or dextrose avoid that some of the sugar alcohols
can affect your digestive system so even though they're low on the glycemic index
they can definitely create bloating so you just want to not do any of those
keto snacks and lower the carbs even more than you're
doing right now number three lower the stress
your environment is crucial there are so many people
that i used to work with in my practice that all we did is get them to
isolate the stress and fully handle it or improve it
and they finally started losing weight why because
your stress elevates cortisol cortisol starts
mobilizing not just muscle protein into sugar which is turning into fat and
raising insulin that way but also it causes the liver to make
sugar okay out of ketones out of fat so we want to
lower the stress stop watching the news for sure
okay next one number four start increasing your sleep
every time that you get insufficient sleep it's going to affect your blood
sugars okay you're going to you're going to
increase hunger so it's going to affect insulin so sleep is vitally important
do whatever you can to also take naps stay in bed rest more which will also
help stress okay number five decrease the dietary
fat so whatever you're doing right now bring
it down to about 75 grams not below that just cut down the fat don't add the
extra mct oil don't add the extra keto bombs at this point number six add
exercise while you're fasting okay so you want to
increase the volume of exercise do it on a gradient don't over train but
definitely add more exercise simply because it's going to help um
probably add another 15 which might not seem like a lot but it
can help number seven i'm not saying come off
your medication but all i'm saying is that medication
can easily block your results so check with your doctor if you answered
medications maybe you can find out some other medication
that has less side effects because you'd be
surprised how many different types of medications
actually cause insulin resistance number eight chances are you have
insulin resistance do things to improve that situation to make
insulin less resistive how do you do that there's
some great things you can do berberine is a very powerful
phytonutrient in certain plants that is compatible in effectiveness to
metformin which is a diabetic medication it's been
thoroughly researched so this is a very good one right here
take more potassium which can help insulin resistance
as well as the b vitamins especially b1 fiber make sure you have enough fiber
from vegetables now why because the microbiome
turned the fiber into butyrate butyrate improves insulin resistance and as a
side note butyrate is very anti-tumor it's very
very uh good to protect you in certain ways
chromium is a good mineral to help the blood sugars as well
as this bile salts that's interesting
purified bile salts not only help you extract fat soluble vitamins essential
fatty acids from your fats but they can also help heal the inside
lining of your colon they can also help a fatty liver they
can also help improve insulin resistance and help
lower your blood sugars garlic is another powerful natural thing
to help insulin resistance okay so i want to
show you this next slide right here
i'm going to talk a little bit about while you're fasting
if you're doing prolonged fasting let's say you're fasting for
two days or three days or even seven days or longer
you have you're trying to avoid the macros the carbs the protein and the fat
right when you're fasting but you also have
micronutrients that would be like the vitamins minerals
trace minerals amino acids essential fatty acids there is no
essential carbohydrates so
what benefit is a carb going to give us well
certain carbohydrates like vegetables will give us vitamins
minerals and trace minerals when you're fasting you can find
maybe some type of concentrate that will give you
the natural vitamins minerals and trace minerals instead of the carbohydrate
so that way we get the nutrients and not all the calories
now protein here's one challenge especially when you get into
prolonged fasting if you're going seven days you're
going a month whatever people are concerned about losing their protein
from their muscle or even their organs so it wouldn't be a bad idea
occasionally to test the waters with certain types of amino acid blends
okay not the actual protein certain amino acid
combinations now protein will give you amino acids it'll give you
vitamins and minerals so but you're already taking vitamins and minerals but
what about amino acids will this break a fast
well there's something called net nitrogen utilization
and this basically is a percentage of how much
nitrogen is being wasted as a byproduct from protein
so in other words when you eat eggs for example
you're really only getting about 48 of those amino acids
that are being used by your body to replace
muscle and other proteins the rest is turned into waste and
fuel okay as glucose well this is why consuming protein when
you're fasting is not going to work because
over half of this is going to turn into sugar that's not going to work
if you consume fish or meat you're only used utilizing about 32 and the rest
is turning into waste or glucose if you're using soy protein
you're only getting 17 the rest is waste or it's turning into glucose is
sugar right whey is even worse than soy you're only
getting 16 the rest is turning into waste
or glucose this is why on the insulin index
this is the worst there's a lot of triggering
of the insulin hormone when you consume whey the reason i'm talking about this
is that there is an amino acid blend that you could take
that gives you a 99 utilization and the research has been done by
professor luca moretti they did the research on the
essential amino acids and exactly what pattern the body needs
to be able to get the great majority of it turning into
muscle or replacing muscle or use primarily as protein synthesis
only one percent of it turns into waste or sugar so even though
this amino acid can trigger insulin there's nothing there
to be stored as fat there's nothing to be converted into fat
compared to these right here so if you're doing a longer fast
and maybe you want to maintain your muscles or you want to keep your
strength up this would be an acceptable thing to
take because you're not taking the protein you're taking the
amino acids which require no digestion and you're taking it in a blend that
doesn't have a lot of waste like branched chain amino
acids for example that will really spike your sugar in fact if you were to
consume branched chain amino acids you may find the next day your your
appetite is higher because it affects your blood
sugars but when you do something like this
you don't have that same effect if you would like more information about this i
put a link down below all right let's talk about
fat primarily we use fat for fuel but we
also use fat to extract the fat cyber vitamins
and also get the essential fatty acids like dha
and epa those are the omega-3 fatty acids when you're doing
longer-term fasting you definitely want to take
fat soluble vitamins as well as maybe cod liver oil or some fish oil cod
liver oil is a little bit better because it has dha
epa vitamin a and vitamin d all together okay so the reason why i brought all
that up is because if you're getting all your nutrients
when you're fasting you're maintaining your health
as a primary goal and part of being healthy is to
keep up the required nutrients that you need
thanks for watching and definitely apply this information

hey guys dr. Berg here in this short video we're gonna talk about the cause of night blindness okay
very simple it's a classic vitamin A deficiency now vitamin A sensitizes the cells of the eye
to respond to light without vitamin a you're not going to get the light in the eye and that's why
it's real hard to see at night so vitamin A the active form is called retinol retinol is mainly
an animal products now you can have vegetables convert into retinol but only a very small
percentage like 4% so chances are if you're not consuming vitamin A from an animal source you're
going to be somewhat deficient okay typically that would be enlightened fish oils grass-fed
animal proteins egg yolks dairy but make sure if you're doing fish oil it's a extra-virgin type
fish oil like cod liver oil that's where you get the vitamin A the good stuff now if you're
taking a vitamin A or you're taking an I don't recommend taking synthetic I reccomend getting
it from the food if you're taking this and it's still not working what you have to look at is the
gallbladder why because the gallbladder releases bile bile basically emulsifies and breaks down
fats and helps you absorb fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D E K and without this bile you're not
going to pull in that vitamin A and that could be the cause especially if you had your gallbladder
removed people that don't have a gallbladder don't have the bile the the quantity of bile just to
really pull in the these fats I love vitamins so you need two substitutes with some bile salts or
something to help the gallbladder because you're always going to be deficient you have a little
tube that comes from your liver down into the intestine but you don't have that gallbladder
that concentrates the amount of bile that you need to release through a meal so so again I
just wanted to let you know that this is very easy to fix if you understand the mechanism using
need to increase this in your diet or fix this over here okay all right thanks for watching

so apple cider vinegar apparently has some really um great effects for many things including skin
disorders like eczema which is an inflammatory skin disorder which actually originates from
the gut if there's a permeability issue let's say there's leaky gut then there's certain things
that can get in through those holes and create an immune reaction and you end up with a skin
disorder the symptoms include like itchiness redness papules which also can be a bit scaly
but you would want to use this topically take some apple cider vinegar like one tablespoon
and about eight ounces of water and then apply it to your skin now what's interesting about this is
that your skin naturally is acidic and so is apple cider vinegar but of course we're not putting you
know the concentrated version we're going to dilute it but the acetic acid seems to help
the skin which is already acid versus people using lotions and detergents and
soaps which is alkaline which sometimes that can worsen this skin condition or any skin condition
and you can also apply other things on your skin like coconut oil which actually will moisturize
the skin and there's some additional properties in the coconut oil it can act as an anti-inflammatory
it's good for the immune system and then you have manuka honey which you can actually maybe
put in the coconut oil which is antibacterial anti-inflammatory and there's some additional
things in there as well now aloe is also great for your skin it's used in wound healing it's
antibacterial it's anti-inflammatory so again you can maybe mix that with the coconut oil and the
honey then you have turmeric cream which turmeric is probably the most potent antioxidant as far as
a plant goes and you can buy that in a cream and apply that to your skin because that's going to
help you reduce inflammation and actually speed up the healing process in 2016 there was a review
that showed 18 studies of positive effects using turmeric cream now i would also take a good amount
of vitamin d orally i would recommend doses in 20 000 ius with zinc as well about i'd say 50
milligrams and some cod liver oil now why the cod liver oil because it has the omega-3 it has the d
and vitamin a and all of that is very beneficial to your skin so we have a topical remedy and we
also have something you can take orally hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's

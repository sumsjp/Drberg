hey guys dr. Berg here I want to share natural nutrients for Parkinson's there's two one is
something called niacinamide okay that's a version of vitamin b3 and it's not going to give you the
flush response but niacinamide is amazing it's very neuro protective it will even actually helped
prevent dopamine deletion and that dopamine is involved in this condition so I highly recommend
taking between 250 to 500 milligrams you can get it anywhere but it's great for a lot of different
things not just your the nerves in your brain but many things like even type 1 diabetes and skin
issues and I'll create a video just down there and then we have the coenzyme q10 in the form
of ubiquinone which is a little bit pricey but it's a very high quality nutrient that will help
protect your brain and nervous system so these two together are a powerful remedy to really help
reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's give it a shot and put your comments down below hi guys thanks
so much for watching press this little button down here and says subscribe and I will make
sure that I won't send more than 5 to 10 videos a day ok no I'm just kidding it'll be 1 or 2 thanks

the question is how to relax sounds easy but actually for some people it's very very difficult
getting your body in a relaxed state can greatly not just help you sleep but it can
help endurance if you're an athlete many many athletes out there especially the top ones
actively practice relaxing and it really helps their performance it can help their speed their
reaction time and in general the more you relax the better concentration you're going to have the
more focus you'll have the better you can learn so relaxation is something that is really not
emphasized enough most people go through life one big ball of stress and i'm going to actually put
you through a little exercise to help you and i recommend you actively do this on a regular basis
question is where do you hold your tension is it in your back in your chest and your
head we'll go through that so you're probably seated right now which is perfect so i'm going
to walk you through this exercise we're going to be going through your body and helping you relax
every single part and then what you want to do is maintain that new level of relaxation
through various activities whether it's driving down the street going through a stressful
situation going to work but i'm not saying drop your production you just want to relax
while you're working while you're driving and you're going to sleep much better all right
the first thing we're going to do while you're sitting there i want you to take all the tension
out of your forehead all the wrinkles the creases relax your forehead okay just let it go
now what about your scalp is there any tension in your scalp relax your scalp just let it go
relaxation is kind of just doing nothing you're not focusing on anything specifically you're just
letting it go all right now let's talk about your eyes there's quite a few muscles around
the eyes relax all the muscles around the eyes and just let the eyes go limp in their sockets
good you got that good try to relax it more just let it go and just melt those muscles all right
let's talk about the breathing you want to slow down your breath and have a nice equal breathing
in and breathing out and as you breathe out just relax your chest all right now let's talk about
your jaw the jaw muscles probably are going to be holding the most tension of your entire body so i
want you just to relax your jaw muscles let them go to the point where your mouth actually opens
can you do that you're going to find that your upper back starts to relax when your jaw is relax
so many people are grinding your teeth at night and they're holding so much tension in their jaw
so even when you actually eat you want to relax your jaw muscles because that's where a lot of
tension builds up all right now let's relax your lips and your tongue and then let's relax the neck
let's start with the front of the neck any tension going on with the front of the neck just let it go
all right now let's go to the back of the neck this is where a lot of people have a lot of
tension so just let it go and relax the back of your neck and then the upper shoulders the
trapezius muscles that's the muscles on the top of the shoulders let's start with the right side
just let that muscle go just pretend like it's melting right now all right let's do the right arm
let's do the bicep that's the muscle in the front part now let's do the back part that's
a tricep just let it go and then the forearm just relax your right hand let's do the left
trap and shoulder right now just let it go relax it all right now the upper arm muscle called the
bicep that's in the front part let that thing go and then let go the tricep that's the back part
just allow it to melt and then the left forearm just relax those muscles
and then relax the left hand so now your upper body should be very very nice relaxed
but let's go to the front part of the chest all the muscles in between the rib cage just
let them go as you're breathing slowly in and out all right let's talk about the stomach so
many people are holding in their stomach all day long because they don't want it to protrude but in
this exercise i want you just to let it go and let your stomach go out and just relax all the muscles
superficially and deeper okay right around the stomach area in the lower abdomen
let's go to the back the mid-back you have different muscles that are around the scapula
let those go and just relax those muscles if you feel like slouching go right ahead now
don't put too much effort into relaxation because that's going to tense you up we're trying to just
maintain regular slowed breathing and relax all of your muscles and as you breathe out try to relax
more of these muscles even more alright now let's go to the lower back this is a common area where
there's a lot of stress try to just let those muscles go you have muscles that come up you got
muscles on the inside you have muscles that come around at the top of the buttocks muscle you have
all sorts of internal muscles to just melt those muscles let them go take all the tension out of
that low back if you have pain your pain will probably be going away while you're doing this
any tension that you have anywhere in that area just allow it to let go you got that all right
we're going to go down the right leg okay and hip on the front part of the thigh just relax that
part of the body and let it go let's go to the back of the leg on the right side the hamstring
allow that to totally relax so there's no tension in that upper leg now let's relax the calf
and the front part of your shin right below the knee just let that go now let's relax your foot
and all of your toes just allow the air of your body to completely let go
all right now let's go to the left side of the body starting with the upper thigh
and relax that muscle it's called the quadriceps let that thing relax good now let's go to the
back part of the leg and do the hamstring just allow it to let go and relax a hundred percent
good moving right down we got the calf let the calf relax fully if there's any tension
in there just relax it then go right to the front part of your thigh and let that go good
now let's go down to the foot let your foot in the toes just totally melt and relax so
you should now be in a very comfortable state of well-being fully relaxed and i'd highly recommend
you make a habit of doing this every single day until it's an automatic thing that you
can maintain this level of relaxation through the day and especially before you go to bed at night
you're going to find your sleeping is going to improve you're going to feel healthier and you're
going to actually have a lot less stress all right do you feel more relaxed now this is a very
important state to be in so the more stress you go through the more you should maintain that overall
body relaxation to keep your stress lower to counter the stress but the key is maintaining it

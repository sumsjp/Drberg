all right today we're going to talk about the cheapest mental health therapy can you guess
bird watching now before you click off just hear me out there's some really interesting research
on this topic bird watching is a natural therapy for stress anxiety and depression
there were three studies in the uk which they combined it was like over 270 people
that showed significant changes in stress anxiety and depression from doing several hours of bird
watching in addition to reducing stress there is a huge boost in happiness which is fascinating
i mean if you think about it what you're doing when you're bird watching you're shifting and
unfixating your attention i don't even know if this is an actual word but i'm just going
to leave it there but let's just define this as shifting your attention from being stuck
on some bad news to something else that is very very therapeutic to take your attention and to
put it into nature whether you're listening to sounds watching birds or identifying trees plants
mushrooms they have all sorts of apps now that you can take a picture of something and it'll tell you
all about it it's actually quite fascinating it's called picture this and it's a free app
and you just take a picture of a plant and it'll tell you all about it and so if you
have stress anxiety or depression this is a valid therapy that's not only inexpensive
but you don't have to really go too far to get it just go in your backyard before you go if you have
a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

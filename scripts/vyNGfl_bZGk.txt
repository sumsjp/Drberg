okay so let's say we got an injury right here from the concussion which actually
hit the back of a the seat cushion headrest whatever right there okay so
what you want to do to fix it you want to take your thumbs take one thumb and
press into the injury like this okay you you want to get different angles come in
this way come down here it's gonna feel really good we want to just take let's
say the injuries right here we want to press into it this way
don't press on top of the or on the injury we want to press into it around
the circle so we can come this way here and you're gonna do this like you might
hold this for about a minute okay then you're gonna hold this for a minute
you're gonna come down into it for a minute come down into it now that's
going to release this trauma right here okay so that's step one now step two is
if you could stand for me okay so now we pressed into the head but now what we
want to do is we want to press from the opposite side of the head so if he hit
his head on the back part we can press on the front okay and we're just going
to apply pressure on the opposite side of the skull and I'll actually go this
way I'm pressing up this way so I'm going to press in here and he'll
probably find it's really tender so I'm going to gingerly kind of come down and
just press right down a line all the way down this way very slowly and we're just
kind of taking all the tension and pushing it towards here because when you
get hit from the back the force gets stuck on the opposite side so we have to
free this up okay so now let's say he hit his head on the windshield on the
face well then we just do the opposite we pressed down into the injury here
here here depending on if it was right here but if he hit his nose we
come down even lower to come down into this way and as you press into it you
actually create a release of that and then you can work on the opposite side
of it's the front end collision now if we hit this side here I can press down
into it this way again the same principle we press into it and I press
on the opposite side wherever he hit his head on this side okay so now the next
step is we're going to have him stand up so if the concussion was right here
whether he hit it in the back of the seat or on cement or get hit over the
head with something step two is you actually hold very gently the injured
area and then we're going to take our hands and tap down the spine you're
going to take the hands about one inch from the spine to the right and to the
left and we're going to take I like to take these two fingers and tap very
lightly like this okay I'm going to do it real slow so you can see all the way
down to the lower part like this while I'm holding the place very lightly where
he got traumatized now what is this doing it what it does is it it gently
puts the communication line back into this traumatized area right here because
we're working on the spinal column that resets everything and you have all these
nerves that come there called the sympathetic nervous system that actually
travel all over the place and you're creating a like a carrier wave sort of
speak to the entire body Plus this is this crosses over what's called the
bladder meridian which the bladder meridian goes to all 12 meridians in
Chinese medicine those are nerve channels so you're actually killing two
birds one stone you're working in the nervous system and the Chinese
acupressure system and you're just touching the area of injury and you're
tapping and then there now if he was it was the front part of the head we would
touch the front part of the head now he could actually touch the back of his
head if if he wanted right where he got it hit and you can just tap it doesn't
matter who holds that part and I just go down like about 20 times what's going to
happen you're going to get more circulation in this area because whatever
wherever his hand touches you're putting the communication line you're linking it
back in you can do this for with any injury over an eye which is a sensitive
area because you don't want to press in the eye you can like if you injured that
you can have them touch it and you can tap and all it does is it forces more
communication into the area that's been traumatized so therefore putting more
circulation and less like stuck energy that gets stuck there okay so those are
the two steps on how to do how to work improve an injury from a concussion go

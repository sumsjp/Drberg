so let me answer the question someone had relating to probiotics and constipation now
typically people take probiotics for diarrhea but not necessarily for constipation in fact taking
the wrong ones can make you more constipated but what is constipation constipation is a situation
where you have stagnant waste in your gut in the large intestine mostly so it's defined as going
less than three times a week but personally i think you should be going at least one time a day
if not a couple times a day because the question is shouldn't you be going every time you eat
because where is all this food going if you're not eliminating now it's pretty wild in practice
i've had people come in to see me that literally only went to the bathroom and i'm not kidding once
every two to three weeks i mean it just blew my mind where is all this this food going
it's a big mystery i have no idea so when someone's constipated they have hard stool
they have pain when they're trying to go to the bathroom and sometimes it's just feels incomplete
so i recommend if you are have constipation only to take two specific strains okay
of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacteria i would not recommend taking other strains because
other strains could create more constipation and also the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria
is also good to take if you have diarrhea now as a side note if you ever take an antibiotic
make sure within two days you're also taking a probiotic at the same time to prevent diarrhea
because here you're killing all the bacteria and you want to replace it with the good bacteria now
some other tips on constipation make sure you're taking enough fluids and liquid okay number two
potassium and magnesium are very important in elimination potassium and magnesium stimulate
the peristalsis or the pumping action of your colon and where do you get potassium and magnesium
from salads from leafy greens now for some people if they start consuming large amounts of salad
because they watched a certain video that i did and if they develop constipation just means they
don't have the friendly bacteria ready to digest all that fiber in which case you want to slowly
and gradually increase your greens over time and typically you get your potassium magnesium
with leafy greens but if you're bloating with all these greens just get your potassium and magnesium
from a good electrolyte and the way that you know you have too much magnesium or potassium is you
usually get diarrhea now the third thing i'm going to recommend is bile salts purified bile salts bile
salts help lubricate the colon and one way to know if you're consuming too many bile salts is if you
get diarrhea but by having just the right amounts of bile salts can help lubricate the colon and
help you eliminate a lot better vitamin b1 also stimulates peristalsis so if you're deficient in
b1 that could be the reason why you're constipated now if you've tried everything else and you're
still constipated i would highly recommend getting an herbal laxative the benefits of elimination are
far more important than the dangers of having constipation with all the auto intoxication that
you're going to get all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video so if you're

hey welcome back now in my last live show
i found out that there is a bit of confusion in a certain area related to
inflammation insulin resistance and just being overweight so i'm going to clear that up with this
this short video here so there's a lot of different chain reactions that occur in the body
when you're dealing with diabetes and also when you're dealing with just gaining weight and so
sometimes things get mixed up and if you actually research this topic you'll find that there's not
a lot of data on cause and effect relationship there's associations there's secondary causes
so i want to try to give you some clarity on um if it's the chicken or the egg okay all right so
inflammation does contribute to insulin resistance which then causes diabetes which is high levels of
glucose in the blood okay so that's true and it's also true that the more fat you have in your body
the more inflammation you're going to have which then can contribute to this but then the question
is do you know anyone who has diabetes that develop diabetes because they have too much
inflammation you know of someone who is overweight because they have too much inflammation probably
not so inflammation in general contributes to this and it might worsen diabetes and it could
actually slow down your ability to lose weight if you're stuck in some plateau if we take a look
at the primary drivers of inflammation glucose is at the top of the list carbs too many carbs
could be that you're consuming too many omega-6 oils okay it could be that you have too much iron
so these are also causes not as common it could be that you have a chronic infection okay that could
cause systemic inflammation could be because you drink too much alcohol it could also be that you
have too much cortisol in your body now cortisol is an anti-inflammatory so it's supposed to get
rid of inflammation but what happens when you have too much cortisol the receptors for cortisol
downgrade so you develop cortisol resistance and then what happens you have a situation where you
have a deficiency of cortisol on one part of your body and you have an excess on the other part and
that can aggravate inflammation now as far as fat goes glucose is the primary driver of fat because
what happens it triggers insulin and insulin is a energy storage hormone so it's going to store
this glucose as fat and it's also going to prevent the mobilization or burning of this fat right here
so both insulin resistance because it increases insulin will cause fat and of course high glucose
will cause fat right here just like i said right here and then having fat keeps inflammation high
and keeps everything kind of locked up and so when i ask the question what is the primary way
that you get into ketosis which is fat burning not everyone said decrease carbs some people
said you know take ketones which is not going to help you lose weight because taking ketones
is not going to turn your fat into more ketones it's going to give you more ketones as energy
and you'll feel a little bit better but it's not going to actually help you lose weight at all
so the two things that cause you to get into ketosis so number one drop your carbs lower your
carbs and decrease the frequency of eating that's what causes ketosis so the fastest way to improve
both diabetes and fixing a plateau situation with your weight is to fix insulin resistance
by lowering carbs and going on intermittent fasting but let's say you're doing that
and it's too slow and you want to speed it up well you can do things to drop inflammation by
lowering your stress reducing your alcohol reducing the omega-6 fatty acids very important
making sure that you're not taking too much iron and also handling a hidden infection that could be
blocking the whole thing oregano oil clove garlic are really really important some people might have
epstein-barr virus or they might have some type of infection that is just keeping everything
locked up so by completely getting rid of inflammation in the body as well as getting
on keto intermittent fasting you can rapidly improve not just diabetes but you can bust
through a plateau with your weight because you are improving insulin resistance so anyway i hope this
kind of clarified some things and for most people you already know this data but for those of you
who don't it's important to get the facts thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

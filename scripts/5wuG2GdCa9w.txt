so today we're going to talk about some of the interesting benefits of doing long walks
for anxiety and depression now at first you might think okay walking that's not going to do anything
but there's some major benefits to doing long walks on a regular basis number one improves
your circulation that's a given i mean even beethoven did regular long walks dickens darwin
and even steve jobs did long walks on a regular basis so you know it's good all right so number
one improves circulation that's probably very well known it helps your heart become more efficient it
provides more oxygen to the brain which improves your cognitive function especially if you have any
type of symptoms of a mental decline or dementia number four weight loss number five it gives you
energy it enhances sleep on the days that i do long walks i always sleep much better why
because it reduces stress which i'm going to get to number six it improves your joints i like to
switch it up sometimes and actually walk backwards i recently did a video on that if you haven't seen
that i've put a link down below to actually switch it up so you're strengthening different muscles
because you're if you're walking one direction you tend to build up certain muscles and not others
also number seven improves your endurance which is part of your fitness number eight it
helps your blood sugars especially if you have diabetes and your sugar is going a little high
by doing long walks you can actually burn that off which is going to be very beneficial so
it's not converted into fat or cholesterol but the biggest benefit of these long walks is for stress
every day we are going through massive amounts of stress mental stress
physical stress but mainly mental stress and long walks is hands down the best way to undo
this mental stress it increases oxygen but at the same time it's a low stress exercise
it will decrease cortisol it can support the parasympathetic nervous system which will help
you sleep it improves your mood i think the biggest benefit of long walks is to get out in
nature and just get space to get your attention going out into your environment and to help you
extract the mental stress that tends to accumulate through the day so whether you go 30 minutes 45
minutes or even 60 minutes or even longer i would highly recommend start this on a daily basis i
walk every single day even in the cold so go ahead and comment down below and tell me what you think

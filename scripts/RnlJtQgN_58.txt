now this was very very surprising to me seven out of ten people take prescription drugs in the u.s
that's 70% of the population that's crazy if you're 45 and older takes four prescription
drugs in the u.s that's insane now listen i'm not against poison i'm sorry medications
but you have to know that there are side effects with every single medication and especially when
you take multiple medications because they react with each other you might be experiencing right
now symptoms that are coming from side effects from the medication and just as my disclaimer
i'm not telling you to come off any medications check with your doctor before coming off any
medications and work with your doctor to come off your medications on a gradual basis because some
medications need to be tapered off on a gradual basis psychiatric drugs like lithium prednisone
you come off too quickly there's some some problems opioids but check with your doctor
i'm not the expert on medications they are all i'm going to say is i think people are
taking way too many prescription drugs and there doesn't seem to be a long-term plan
to come off those drugs so this is some questions that i would recommend asking your doctor what is
the long-term plan with your medications is there any point where you're going to come off of them
that's the question that you want to ask you want to get a plan or is it a permanent thing for the
rest of your life which does not make sense and so the next question you want to ask your doc is
what is the actual cause of my symptom and a lot of times they won't have an actual cause in fact
it might be idiopathic which means unknown cause ninety percent of hypertension is idiopathic they
don't know and i would also want to ask the doctor what are the long-term symptoms of these drugs
and other side effects that then are going to cause me to need another drug to treat the symptom
of this drug ask a lot of questions now this next question is very very appropriate simply because
the toxicity of drugs i would ask your doctor are you willing to help me wean off these medications
if they are great if they're not you might want to find another doctor that's willing to work with
you especially if they don't have a long-term plan and they don't know the cause of your symptoms
but i want to say this one point um and this is very under emphasized
it's the diet now for 30 years i've worked with patients correcting their diet and i would work
with a lot of doctors thousands of doctors and they're just blown away at how a simple
eating plan could greatly improve their symptoms to the point where the need for medication
came way down to the point where many times they didn't need the medication anymore
but a lot of times there's just not this awareness from your doctor of the power of a change in diet
can have over these symptoms so before you start adding all these supplements and herbal things
i would highly recommend start with the basic diet the one i'm going to recommend is in the
link down below on the description if you're new to my channel this is might be a whole new thing
but it's very very powerful the next thing is to find an alternative an herbal alternative or some
natural remedy that has a proven record of helping that particular symptom now i've done thousands
of videos on this topic so you can actually do a search and find out some good alternatives to use
when dealing with a certain complaint so just get with your doctor and just say listen we want to do
a pilot we want to do a test or an experiment to see if we can try an alternative remedy instead
of the medication see if you can work with them on this and you might find that your doctor is
very willing to work with you and it all works and guess what you're able to come off this medication
and now you have a lot less toxicities flowing through your body there are three supplements
that may be helpful in the transition of coming off your medications specifically because two of
them work with the liver and the other one is kind of a no-brainer because it addresses inflammation
and it can really drop inflammation and a lot of other symptoms pretty quick so the first one is
called tudka this is a very specific type of bile salt that helps the liver drain properly it can
actually keep the toxins from accumulating in the liver as you come off your medications so there'll
be less withdrawal symptoms and then milk thistle which is a really good one for the liver as well
and then vitamin d those are the three ones that i highly recommend as you make your transition off
these medications with the help of your doctor hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled

so I wanted to create this video to help you understand a very important thing
about the immune system and I'm gonna relate it to how HIV destroys your
immune system now HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus and this virus
causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome which is a broadly named
condition that can create a lot of problems for someone but mainly you lose
your defenses you lose your immune system now this is interesting because
this virus has a very unique strategy of attacking something that is so important
that it basically knocks the entire army out all by attacking this oneself the T
helper cell the T helper cell is one of the t-cells stands for thymus because it
actually gets its training in the thymus gland the T helper cell is the most
important immune cell because what it does it's required for all adaptive
responses what I mean adaptive responses there's two parts of the immune system
you have the primal immune system which you're born with that knows what to do
it doesn't need any training and it pretty much takes care of the day-to-day
activities of defending you but when things get more threatened you have
another part of the immune system called the adapted or the acquired that start
to recruit additional very specialized specific cells that do certain jobs this
system is all coordinated by the T helper cell I look at this cell like the
general that coordinates a plan of attack and recruits the specific types
of immune cells that are needed for the battle and also has a lot of estimation
and judgment of what type of weapon tree that your body is going to need and what
type of power and force that is needed to overcome the enemy which is the virus
or the bacteria or some other pathogen HIV virus is very sneaky because it
fuses with the t-helper cell and then it starts taking
over the DNA and it starts reproducing leaving your T cells completely wiped
out basically you don't have much of an immune system anymore now if you think
about it the T helper cells are recruiting killer
T cells which are your special forces that are dedicated to killing viruses
the stored killer T cells the T helper cell activates and grows the killer T
cells it also maximizes the killing power of the macrophages and macrophages
are cells that eat viruses and bacteria they're very large and putting it into a
sack of acid and enzymes and other chemicals to kill it I'm talking about
hydrogen peroxide the main ingredient to bleach they use that they also have
antibiotics and other enzymes so it's quite an interesting weapon also the T
helper cells activate the B cells B cells stand for bone as in bone marrow
that's where a lot of the immune systems are developed but the B cells are those
that make antibodies that help neutralize the chemical reactions the
antibodies don't kill anything they pretty much just tag the virus okay as
the enemy so these other cells can go there and defined and kill off the virus
or bacteria now think about it if you wipe out this cell right here you don't
get any of these actions right here why am I talking about this well one reason
is there is a nutrient that can keep these cells strong and if this nutrient
is deficient they're inhibited and I'm talking about vitamin D if you're
deficient in vitamin D your t helper cells will be suppressed if someone had
AIDS it would be very very smart to take a lot of vitamin D and the other thing I
want to mention which is also interesting is that this HIV virus not
only takes out this t helper self but it also blocks your vitamin D
receptors limiting your ability to absorb vitamin D vitamin D is crucial
and immune function so apparently this virus is very very sneaky it knocks out
not only the main controller but the main nutrient that your body needs to
keep the immune system healthy it all comes back to having a strong immune
system in the first place to prevent an infection and also understanding the key
nutrients involved in that vitamin D is one of the big ones if you wanted to
know all the nutrients that are involved in a strong immune system I created a
video right here check it out

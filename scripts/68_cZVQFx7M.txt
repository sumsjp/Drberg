Hey Dr Burk Here in this video We're
going to talk about probably one of my
most popular Products called the
gallbladder Formula i mean the amount of
people that have digestive Stress is
amazing um but the gallbladder is a sack
that is hanging Underneath Your liver
And it what it does is it stores And it
releases Something called bile b i l e
not Bow as in waste but bile b i l e and
bile is likened uh to the detergent that
you would use When you're cleaning
dishes to dissolve the Grease so bile
helps you Break Down fats um and that
includes the healthy fats like essential fatty
acids that you need uh Fish oils
All these Great fats that actually have
good properties for your heart and a lot of
Things but it also helps you absorb
the fat cable vitamins like vitamin a
Which is for the sinuses the lining of the skin
through the sinuses and
through the lung um the the Eyes um the
um immune System
um the kidney so vitamin a is very very
important in All those aspects and then
vitamin D for the calcium absorption
vitamin K uh for calcium metabolism um
and also vitamin e For The
cardiovascular To support a healthy
Heart so This is very very important in absorbing
fats and also satisfying you
because if you consume food and You're not satisfied
chances are you don't have
the quantity of bile to Pull in the
nutrients to satisfy the Brain so this helps thin your
own bile it helps Your
Body Make bile And it helps you give
bile because it Has bile salts in it so
they purified B salts with some
additional digestive things that help
your stomach that help your pancreas that
help your colon and the People Who
Take this uh are usually people that have
bloating or um Things like that or
they Might have constipation because
bile helps lubricate the colon so if you
need Something to support Your Digestive
System uh you May want to try the
gallbladder Formula and One Last Thing
if you don't have a gallbladder i highly
recommend that you Take this As Well
because it will give you the necessary
bile to help you but some of the
symptoms of deficiency would be uh your
stool that floats or Light colored stool
or You Get bloating burping Maybe some
Right shoulder Pain because Where the
gallbladder might refer to the right
shoulder or maybe even headaches
so that is a summary of the gallbladder
formula

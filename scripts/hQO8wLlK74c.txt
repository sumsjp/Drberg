now i know a lot of people do not like their belly fat it doesn't look good it gets in the way but
you have to realize that this belly fat is the tip of the iceberg there's a lot more going on
behind the scenes okay then that's what i'm going to talk about so yes it doesn't look
good but let's talk about what's really happening on the inside of your body for you to have a big
belly you first have to have a fatty liver now the simple version of this is that your liver becomes
fatty because you're eating too many carbs and the carbs are being converted into fat in the liver in
other places but the liver is only a certain size there's only so much fat that you can cram in the
liver before it starts to overfill and spill over into other organs outside the fat cell that's
called ectopic fat around the organs that's called visceral fat so when you see people with a belly
you know they have a fatty liver and all this is coming from a high carb diet as well as a person
eating many frequent meals you know having three meals with two snacks that increases the insulin
and insulin is the storage hormone it will take those carbohydrates and it turns the carbs into
fat inside your liver and around the organs now typically what a person only sees is what's on
the outside they see their belly but they don't associate any other problems at least initially i
mean their blood sugars are usually normal why because the insulin is taking care of it the
insulin comes in there takes it out of the blood so then we can maintain normal glucose levels
so we really don't see the high blood sugar situation for at least a couple decades
and we don't even see the high insulin that's doing all this conversion because the doctor never
tests your insulin levels if he or she did they would find it would be very very high
and by the way there's a great test called homa ir to detect your insulin levels and so
here we have this camouflage situation where the high sugar is being camouflaged by the insulin
and the insulin is working really hard in the background to store all this fat and so unless
you have an ultrasound in the liver you're not going to detect that there is a fatty
liver all you're going to see is you have a gut and then as the years go on as the liver becomes
fully filled with fat and now you start developing insulin resistance so it takes more and more
insulin to lower this blood sugar until the point where the body finally can no longer compensate
for all the sugar and then that's where the blood sugar starts going up you become a pre-diabetic
and then an actual diabetic so the deeper cause of this insulin resistance is really
a fatty liver because the liver can no longer function and everything starts backing
up and you can pretty much summarize the fatty liver to be aka also known as a high carb diet
and a lot of people are not connecting the dots between the other symptoms that this high
blood glucose and insulin is creating like fatigue frequent urination especially at night
like sleep apnea like a weakened immune system like inflammation in the joints like arthritis
like cravings to sugar or metabolic syndrome which is high blood pressure heart disease a fatty liver
and diabetes type 2. you see all of these things and a belly fat is coming from the same thing
high carb diet high blood glucose and high insulin so in summary i know your belly fat doesn't look
good but it's just the tip of the iceberg there's a lot more going on beneath the scene and so if

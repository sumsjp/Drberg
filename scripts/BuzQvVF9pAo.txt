there's a very shocking fact about your
food that you need to know about
i want to cover some real basic
definitions first and then i'm going to
dive right in if you look at the back of
any label of any food that you eat
there's something called nutrition facts
okay
which is fascinating because these are
not facts at all they're just
they're guesses basically they should
call them nutrition guesses okay
and before i get into that part let me
just first start here you probably
remember these things called rdas
recommended dietary allowance it means
how much of a certain nutrient you need
based on your age if you're male or
female
if you're pregnant or lactating okay
then you have something called ai
adequate intake that is how much of a
certain nutrient you need to prevent an
obvious
deficiency okay
obvious so that would be like how much
you would need to prevent scurvy like
vitamin c or berry berry vitamin b1 or
rickets where you have vitamin d
but what the fda did
is they simplified it they came up with
something called recommended daily
intake rdis okay and that relates to an
estimation of nutrient needs based on a
2000 calorie
diet per day
regardless of age male or female
pregnancy lactating so in other words
they did not
have these variables included they
wanted to simplify it okay
and then you have this thing right here
which you probably will read on the back
of your labels more than anything else
it's percent
of dv
daily value now what does that mean well
that gives you a percent of a given
nutrient as it relates to
the rdis okay so if you look in the back
of the label you'll see percent db and
all these different percentages like 5
10 30
and the ones i really want to focus on
are the ones that relate to like vitamin
a vitamin b vitamin c etc so for example
like one serving of of something will
give you like 30
of your vitamin a
needs okay
so that's really what that's all about
the big problem with that
is this it's just a guess number one
they don't factor in your age young
people need different amounts than
adults versus old people
women need different amounts than men
men need more zinc women need more iron
also women that are pregnant or
lactating need a little bit more of
certain nutrients so that's not
factored into that and so these numbers
are definitely not related to facts
facts are based on evidence
okay
they're just not precise what about the
activity level of the person right let's
say someone's an athlete versus
sedentary you think there's a variation
of nutrients with that or what about
their ability to digest the food let's
say they have no gallbladder let's say
they're older and don't have enough
hydrochloric acid let's say for example
they have inflammation in their gut
they're not going to be able to absorb
hardly any nutrients or let's say the
food that they're eating is a grain with
phytic acid which blocks zinc so that's
another huge factor
because if you eat that food it's not
going to be absorbed and then we have
cofactors like vitamin d and calcium
right
you need
vitamin d to help you absorb
calcium and then we have the source of
the vitamin is that vitamin coming
because it's been enriched with some
synthetic vitamin or is it naturally in
the food as a whole food
vitamin
complex or even is it a natural vitamin
and then we have hormones let's say the
person has insulin resistance they're
not going to absorb very much of any
nutrient and if they have inflammation
in the liver or another part of the body
that is also going to inhibit their
absorption the more stress they have the
more they're going to have vitamin
deficiencies and a greater need for
certain nutrients especially the b
vitamins the less sleep they have the
greater the need for nutrients if
they're a diabetic there's it's a whole
different picture of what kind of
nutrients you're going to need as well
as the absorption
if you're a smoker for example the
requirement for vitamin c is going to be
way way higher because
smoking
completely oxidizes vitamin c and then
you have if the person's diet is filled
with sugar and junk food which is going
to deplete those nutrients as fast as it
goes in and lastly we have the
bioavailability let's say that iron
they're talking about comes from spinach
and not from red meat huge difference in
that nutrient being available to the
body or not so the shocking fact about
your food is that those facts are not
facts
they are actually
guesses
don't worry it gets worse
there are some other problems the source
of information okay by the fda for
example did you realize that in one
study that i just read and i'll put that
link down below
15 out of 26 fda employees who left the
fda
now work or consult to big pharma and
the food industry
you think that could possibly affect
i don't know the nutritional
recommendations or the governing panels
which
could have some biases or some vested
interest see the problem with the
medical profession is there's no
training in nutrition
so you have to learn it after you
graduate but to put medical boards and
governmental agencies like the fda over
your health and food is not a good idea
even the majority of nutritional studies
is industry funded okay and i'm not
talking about drug studies i'm talking
about nutritional studies all right
that's another problem and then you also
have the amounts that they're talking
about are only related to preventing a
deficiency
not creating optimum health to create
health you need sufficient nutrients you
don't need just the bare amounts and
what we're really trying to do is we're
trying to create health okay we're not
just trying to
prevent scurvy and then one last problem
is that some of the recommendations are
actually too high like calcium for
example i mean when i see what's
recommended for calcium if you're going
to take that every day your body is
going to calcify
i mean there's studies that show that
even when women post menopausal women
take the recommended amount of calcium
their risk for heart attack goes
up
and so calcium is not something that is
easily excreted to the body and then you
have iron in men men have a almost
impossible time getting rid of too much
iron too much iron can be very toxic to
men and women who are post-menopausal
okay those are some of the problems
there's a brilliant professor in
biochemistry that i'd like to mention dr
bruce ames
he came up with the triage theory okay
and that has to do with
the body will ration nutrients
to short-term survival actions not
long-term
health or longevity or preventing cancer
so if the body does not have enough of a
certain nutrient it's going to allocate
that to functions that will help on an
immediate basis like let's take for
example vitamin k1 that helps with
bleeding okay so if the body only has a
certain amount of k1 it's going to clot
dairy and stop bleeding but it's not
going to be allocated to certain things
that might be involved with longevity or
your dna uh things like that but in one
of his papers he talked about a very
very interesting story uh i'm not going
to get into it but all i'm going to tell
you is this
a folic acid deficiency okay a folic
acid deficiency
will create the same damage as
radiation okay to your dna your
chromosomes so radiation breaks up your
chromosomes well guess what a folic acid
deficiency will also break up your
chromosomes and
a lot of other nutrients are involved in
dna synthesis dna repair so it's pretty
obvious that
we don't put enough attention on these
nutritional deficiencies and because
they're missing okay they're omitted
we don't have a tension on it right we
only we don't see something that's
missing why because it's it's missing we
don't look at it right so if you were
exposed to like a nuclear power plant
that had a meltdown
that would be obvious but how would you
really know if you're deficient in folic
acid right you really wouldn't so
getting enough nutrients is very
important i do have a solution for you
all right here's the solution
eat food
that's nutrient dense
next question is is it going to be
plant-based
is it going to be animal-based
well guess what you have a lot of
different sources of vitamin c
b vitamins vitamin d
vitamin e
that are in both animal and plant okay
now typically you're going to get more a
more complete profile if you consume
more animal
sources of food
but there are a lot of other nutrition
that you can get from plant i recommend
you combine both of these
if you're a vegan it's going to be more
difficult to get b12
zinc
iron
omega-3 fatty acids you can do it it's
just more difficult plus the amino acids
that you would get in plant food are not
nearly as bioavailable and it's more
difficult it's possible but it's more
difficult
but just to cover all bases i recommend
you combine both of these right here now
number three
the taste of your food
will tell you
if it's nutrient dense
the smell of your food will tell you
if it's nutrient dense
i mean you've done this you eat a tomato
at the store there's absolutely
positively no taste to that tomato at
all
also like a carrot right i've eaten
carrots like there's just nothing or
bell peppers there's no
taste okay
i can take a tomato i can smell it to
know if it's nutrient dense okay a
tomato that is grown in your garden wow
it smells completely different it tastes
completely different why because the the
flavor
chemicals are connected
to
the nutrients the more nutrients
the better it's going to taste
the better it's going to smell
now how do we know if something is
nutrient dense i'm going to show you
this
test it's called the brix test okay
i don't know if you've ever seen one of
these but this is a bricks test it's
fairly inexpensive
and i want to explain how it works
you could use this in your garden you
can use this in the grocery store well
you probably if you're going to go to
the grocery store you're going to have
to buy
the
the leaf or the stem or the plant or the
fruit before you test it because
you have to crush it in like garlic
press right here right or some other
crushing device this is called a
refractometer which basically refracts
light it
it changes the angle of light there's a
prism here you just take a drop of a
crush uh leaf from your salad or a
tomato or a berry and you put it right
on this little lens right here you put
this on top
and you look into the light and you will
see a scale
okay
and this scale tells you
how
concentrate
the the sugars are the proteins the
minerals
the nutrients
so
roughly on the brix test
if something is above 12
now this is a generality because some
things need to be higher some some
things would be a little bit lower but
generally if it's above 12
that food is going to contribute to your
health
okay if it's really low let's say it's a
three or two
it's not going to contribute to your
health
so a lot of people are eating
very low quality food
thinking that they're getting something
from it but they're really
not
what's
also very interesting about this bricks
test is that if something is over 12
that plant is immune from insects okay
if it's below 12 let's say it's three or
four
it's like a magnet for insects insects
eat
dead and decaying
plants okay and fruit they'll go in
there and they'll start eating that
but they don't consume
healthy nutrient-dense
fruits
vegetables and plants also if something
is above 12 it has a higher shelf life
and it does not experience as much frost
damage so the brix test is a relatively
inexpensive test to kind of give you a
good idea of something as nutrient dense
or not and i will put a link down below
of how to use it
but here's the next and most important
question
how do you get
food that is above 12 on the bricks test
healthy animals come from healthy plants
healthy plants come from healthy soils
okay it's the soil that's where our
health
starts the difference between
soil and dirt
is that dirt has no
microbial life
soil has a lot of microbial life
and you can't just grow your vegetables
on dirt it has to be fertile soil it has
to have a lot of life to grow that in
there right and also when i'm talking
about life i'm talking not just about
bacterial life
i'm talking about fungi or fungus right
so in our soils we need
ideally a one-to-one ratio of fungus to
bacteria to get optimal fertility of
that soil to grow something
if something's really high in bacteria
and very low in fungus like no fungus
then you're just going to get weeds you
just can't grow
crops that you can eat now the big
problem is if you want to grow food in
your backyard or if you have a farm okay
you have to do soil samples right and
you have to send them out and i've done
that
and soil samples are not cheap you have
to send it to the lab sometimes it takes
like
almost two weeks or longer and it's
expensive i remember i sent something
out it was like 600 bucks right very
expensive
i found a really amazing
test
that you can do at home on your garden
or on your farm
and it's called the micro biometer okay
this is a very inexpensive testing kit
that can measure two very important
things it measures the quantity
of microbes in your soil like the
concentration of microbes that how much
life it has
and so it needs to be like over
you know four five hundred six hundred
it can't be like
200 or 100
or all you're going to be able to grow
is weeds
and the other thing it will test is your
ratio between your fungi to bacterial
ratio
and you really want this to be one to
one so this gives you incredible
feedback within 10 minutes at a very
inexpensive cost i think like one test
costs i think 11 to 50 cents i mean
compared to hundreds of dollars for one
test and this has a capacity for doing
10 different tests you can test your
soil see where you're at you can give it
certain things like amendments like
minerals or microbes whatever and then
you can retest it to see over time how
fertile is and so i did a lot of
research to try to find a home test that
i could do that will give me this data
and there's nothing out there that
compares to this i mean it's very very
creative how they came up with this test
and it's very credible and a lot of
farms use it if you have a garden or a
farm or you just want to test your grass
in the backyard and i think you'd be
very interested what you find but it's
important to get a baseline and to
measure things over time
this right here nutrient-dense foods
really comes from
the soil and so this is why i always
emphasize going to farmers market grow
your own food if possible
definitely do grass-fed while caught
organic as much as possible so i have a
special guest i was able to
get the president of this organization
uh just to ask her some quick questions
it's laura decker as well as their
marissa their soil scientists so i'm
excited just to kind of dive in and get
some additional questions uh related to
this microbiometer which first of all i
just want to say
um
a person's health is dependent on the
plants and animals they eat and then the
plants and animals are dependent on the
soil the health of the soil and the
difference between soil and dirt is that
soil is alive and the more life it has
the better
and so
as i told you before laura
you know this is very expensive to send
my soil samples in but uh i stumbled on
your company that you're able to
we can do this right on site and it's a
quick test it's like 10 minutes and you
can find out great information so if i
could just pick your brain in a couple
questions of course
um
so
there's two main things that this
test can evaluate one is the
the amount of the number of microbes
that we're dealing with right
so
as far as
your experience working with other
people around the world with this this
great tool
um
are you finding some interesting things
related to um
does it correlate with the number of
microbes and people saying well yeah my
crops were getting insects and i'm
getting having problems with this or the
fertility of the land and
the things that they grow on them
well the first thing i'll say is we are
used around the world we're in over 20
countries and soil varies tremendously
of course within the united states but
also around the world
and soil is different because it's made
up of different things but also because
we've done different things to it right
so if you go to iowa right
you're not going to find virgin iowa
soil in agriculture you're going to find
incredibly processed soil um if you go
to other countries you'll you'll see so
to sort of say what's the normal soil is
very unusual and soil like you said
is is obviously it's got a mineral and a
you know component but it also is living
it has microbes it has worms it has air
it has all kinds of things in it
um and so what we found is most people
who use the kit understand that microbes
vary throughout the cycle and the year
they're impacted by how we treat the
land and what we do to the land right we
know that extensive tilling
sort of destroys your fungal content
which builds soil structure which makes
your soil ironically more compact which
means you have to till it again right i
mean
it's it's you're either in a virtuous
cycle or a vicious cycle
um and so what we have found is people
use the test the most to evaluate their
change in practice
right so they're going to biostimulants
they're using either oxygenated water or
they're using maybe an algae component
so a lot of the times the things that we
see make the most difference in
microbial content are things that feed
the microbes right so there's microbes
everywhere right you don't necessarily
have to put them into the soil
because
they're all over right as covatotis
germs are everywhere but they're
bacteria it's fine but if they're not
growing in the soil it's because they're
not being fed right we've done things to
the soil to make it have very low
organic matter
to be very compact right to not have air
to to be so compact that water runs out
so it's either too wet or too dry so
when people do things to feed the
microbes right the microbes will
flourish
you can't just throw live microbes on
soil that can't sustain life
it doesn't work
um so that's how we find that people use
the test the most to say okay i know i
need to change it there's no formula
right the formulaic method of
agriculture which is throw down npk
you know it is not working and there is
no
one way to fix the soil around the world
it's very very particular and it's an
art and a science um and we developed
the test to be used on fresh soil
because you're testing living things
right you said it's the lab they dry it
and freeze it who knows what happens to
the microbes
and we also test dormant microbes so you
do know that when when microbes die
they'll either die and sort of fall
apart or they'll um spore you know be
dormant
um and then they reproduce every 15
minutes right so it doesn't take much if
you feed them and get the right
conditions
um as dr fitzpatrick used to say that
they're they have a lot of sex they they
reproduce tremendously um so if you get
the conditions right you can do it and
people use the
to say okay i did this treatment what
was the change not do i have a good
number am i done but what is the change
through through my practice that i can
see often um and quickly so the very
long answer but
hey well uh you know there's you sent me
a really good simple chart and it's on
your website now i found that you can
just kind of gives you a reference of
what what is good bad and terrible so
you can kind of start with something and
you can
progress but um in different parts of my
my uh property because i'm living on a
farm right now
i mean
you you test the soil where i have all
the weeds that no grass grows
i mean it's like
it's as heavy on
bacteria so that brings up the next
question we have this ratio of
fungi to bacteria
um
just tell us a little bit is that how
important is that if we're trying to
grow something in our garden
yeah
so that
what we know and and and there's
material out there that's way better
when i'm that what i'm going to say but
we know is that that in all soil there's
there's
a fungi and bacteria they don't
necessarily compete with each other all
the time
but we do know that
fungi um
are important for building soil
structure so they are the ones who make
um
make it possible for the soil to be
aerated to hold on to water right and
for roots to to grow more um easily
throughout the soil we also know that if
you're growing food
that fungal
fung that fungi do a lot of immune work
for the plant and that immune response
that the fungi helps the plant
is what sort of brings
the antioxidants into the plant right
that we then want to eat because it
helps us in our immune system so
um people want a lot of fungal content
because it helps build soil structure
which is a virtuous cycle
um it improves the taste and the quality
of plants as well
um and it gives things into like
different tastes so a lot of that's why
a lot of organic food will taste better
because it has higher fungal content now
you can also throw down a lot of
mycorrhizal fungi you can inoculate the
soil with fungi but again if your soil
cannot support
those they won't they won't cultivate
so a lot of people in agriculture want a
one-to-one ratio
or
better you know when i i had i took like
seven different sound samples the other
day and i haven't recorded like it's
quite
i mean one part of your
yard is one thing it can go all the way
to this side
and uh also i tested something in the
woods it was just it was interesting it
was a great experiment to do that i'm
going to be
doing this my own experiment to see if i
can get this
good ratio of one to one because um i
was really heavy on the bacteria so and
hardly any fungus so so you're trying to
grow crops or vegetables um it's just
not easy and and you can but they're not
going to taste
like anything because yeah and
it's interesting that you're using the
forest because in a forest there's so
much differentiation even in a small
area between
fungal and bacteria because different
things are growing naturally so
um people test it for forest but you'll
find a big variation right by a tree you
know in an area where sun hits
um but it is really fun to see the
difference in what agricultural soil
biological life looks like and what um
forests
look like as well
well i'm just glad you guys came up with
this very creative ingenious test to be
able to just quickly test something
without having to send it to the lab
because i mean it took me i think two
weeks to get my lab report back i mean
first of all in the mail by the time it
gets there i don't know how many
microbes are going to be left alive
so um
for those of my viewers that have
gardens or farms or just you'd like to
test your grass in the back of your yard
um
laura was so kind to give us a coupon
code with 15 off so if you want to get
the kit it's already very inexpensive
and i think one kit will do 10 tests so
um
i'm gonna put the coupon code down below
with the link so
if you guys would like to get one you
can get one and check it out and do your
own experiments
but you can't really um
improve soil if you really don't have a
reference of where you're at
so this gives you an inexpensive way to
test it so
um i happen to just be looking for
something like this and then you you
guys popped up and
i just i was like looking for quite some
time to find out how i can check
uh you know the soil but all you know
the only thing you can find out there is
like ph testers
you know you can check some the currency
of the current in the soil and
maybe there's some like you can check
npk
you know but
microbial life i don't think there's
anyone out there that's that has a test
that you can actually just bring right
to your
backyard
yeah thank you i appreciate it and
anyone who gets a test that has
questions our company is very small
we're located in new york we do
everything ourselves
and we love to hear from people um we're
also working on a new release of the app
that's going to be a better calibration
to get more detailed testing
because as we've learned around the
world um at first we thought oh under
100 no one's there well turns out a lot
of the world is under 100 so we're
working on making that precision at the
at the higher end so that's really
exciting for people that's going to come
out in the fall and that'll really um
make it easier for larger organizations
to use this as well
that's great so that's why i think it's
just a great uh tool to identify like
the real core source of someone's health
it starts from the soil so
i just appreciate your uh you guys
coming up with it and your time for
doing this interview so uh um thank you
very much thank you and uh
i appreciate your input
okay have a good day

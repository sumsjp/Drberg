so today we're going to talk about melancholy and the real cause
so melancholy is sadness depression it comes from the greek word
which means black bile now that's pretty interesting
black bile well during the medieval period
melancholy was one of the four temperaments and that had to do with
different behaviors or characteristics and if you look at more of the
temperament of melancholy you also get three additional symptoms
which gives huge clues on what's actually causing this we get
bloating we get distension and constipation
now this to me and this indicates there's something
going on with the gallbladder so if you do a search on the gallbladder
in relationship or associated with depression
you'll find a whole bunch of data this is what's interesting gallstones
greater risk for depression by 80 percent
now why would someone with gallstones be more depressed we'll answer that in a
second next point removal of the gallbladder
can potentially decrease the risk for depression
by 20 why is that and low-fat diets okay increase the risk
of depression why well this is why fat especially saturated fat
triggers the release of bile
gall gallstones come from a lack of bile removing the gallbladder
let's say for example there's a bunch of stones in there
and that's obstructing the flow of bile can increase the flow so that could
decrease the risk of depression by a certain amount what
do all these indicators point to including all three of these a lack of
bile a bile deficiency a bile deficiency will cause gall stones
a low-fat diet will also cause a bile deficiency
all right so now what's the connection between bile and your mood
if you don't have enough bile you're not going to absorb
vitamin d and vitamin d deficiency will create
serious depression also if you don't have enough bile you're not
going to absorb this omega-3 fatty acid dha
when you're deficient in dha and you can't get enough
you could not only have severe depression
but your risk of suicide goes up so there's a huge connection between
the fat that you eat and the fat that is broken down
and gets absorbed getting the right amount
of certain fats and also because vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin
you need bile to be able to absorb it if you have melancholy
or you're depressed you may need more vitamin d
or dha but remember these don't work without bile so you may just benefit
from some purified bile salts thanks for watching

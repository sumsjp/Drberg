so the question is can you actually get fat by consuming too much protein well here's the
thing the body can only use so much protein and any additional amounts past that certain point
is either wasted through your kidneys or is used by fuel because it's converted to glucose and so
the problem is if we consume too much protein and it turns to glucose that's going to trigger
insulin right and that's going to make you fat but there's something very unique about protein
you don't only trigger insulin you trigger the opposing hormone which is made by your pancreas
called glucagon glucagon has nothing to do with glycogen which is stored sugar
they sound similar but glucagon is a hormone and it basically does the opposite of insulin whereas
insulin stores fat glucagon burns fat and so when you eat too much protein you actually stimulate
both of these hormones and you can kind of get a neutralizing effect when glucagon is triggered
at the same time as insulin and so it's very different than just consuming carbohydrates which
will stimulate only insulin and not glucagon and there's no studies that i could find that
consuming too much protein makes you fat or puts on weight and i really have not seen it as well
because it's very difficult to isolate people that are just consuming too much protein they're
usually consuming a lot of protein with carbs but if you were to lower your carbs and just have more
protein i haven't seen people gain weight on that what i have seen is this it can slow down their
ketosis okay because you're you're stimulating insulin and what makes people get into ketosis
is the reduction of insulin and so they might not gain weight but they just slow down
and their ability to lose weight they also can be very tired if they have too much protein it could
be because the spike in insulin it could also be because they don't have enough hydrochloric acid
and so the protein doesn't get digested and they can get tired just from that i have seen people
get very bloated and even constipated if they consume too much protein probably also related
because they don't have enough digestive help and also you're overloading the digestive system
where it can't process that much protein in one sitting also protein can act like a stimulant
and it can keep you from getting into a nice restful sleep at night so it can affect sleeping
indigestion make you tired bloated and a slow down ketosis now another question that people have is
is that excess protein going to damage my kidneys i couldn't find any data to support that but i do
know that too much protein is only a problem if your kidneys are unhealthy or you have kidney
damage or liver damage because those two organs have to deal with the excess and if they're not
healthy enough they won't be able to do that i think adding more protein to a keto plan
would be good if you are younger if you have a fast metabolism and especially if you're doing
fasting and you're not consuming as many meals like one meal a day for example then you could
definitely add more protein simply because it's going to allow your body to process that protein
over many hours versus three meals two snacks and a lot of protein that would not be good all
right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here
avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you

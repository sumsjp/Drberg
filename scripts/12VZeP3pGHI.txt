so i have another question for you what is the food
that is the most difficult to give up on keto
is it the pasta how about bread is it the chips corn chips potato chips
popcorn that was my weakness by the way i'll
just put a little chuck mark there sugar desserts
what about rice potatoes or is there another one
go ahead and comment down below i'd like to know your biggest weakness on
keto the goal is to put you in a state of health
so healthy that occasionally going off the program is not going to create a big
problem the problem when you do go off the
program is that the next day your blood sugars are off
and you're going to want it more and more so it's kind of a slippery slope
because as soon as you start to go off and then you go off and then you keep
going off and a month later you're off the other problem is that
when you consume these foods they're called
carbohydrates you're going to activate dopamine and
dopamine is part of the addictive circuitry
that you have in your brain that you need more and more of it to achieve the
same effect so you start off having a little bit and
then you end up having a lot down the road but overall
healthy keto and intermittent fasting is your best
option for handling the physical addictions the body addictions
to certain foods especially these right here
because it's going to get rid of your hunger it's going to get rid of your
cravings but unfortunately it doesn't handle the
mental habits that you might have or the mental addictions you have
certain memories you're in social situations and everything goes out the
window and you slide right into your happy
place where you start consuming some of these foods
so i have a couple tips for you number one you absolutely positively need
some substitutes similar foods for these so that way you don't feel deprived
because as soon as someone says that you can't have something
it creates scarcity and you're gonna want it more
so that's one problem and another problem there's so many insanities that
are connected with foods feeling guilty for eating something you
shouldn't beating yourself up that whole thing
just do keto consistently as long as you can
and work on trying to improve your self-control
with the ideal situation of eventually getting to the point where you really
don't need it you can have it but you don't have to have it
so that would be the ideal goal because you handled the physical
thing and now you're retraining yourself to have better habits
with the help of some of these substitute foods that will give you
similar pleasure so you get rid of your hunger
you have no more cravings you're working on self-control
there's also a point about being satisfied after a meal
because some people when they eat something they feel full
but they're not satisfied they need a little something something right after
that meal this has to do with
doing healthy keto versus dirty keto consuming foods that are high in
nutrients that will satisfy you the longer you do this the more you're going
to correct insulin resistance and you're going to
be able to absorb more nutrients because insulin resistance
blocks your ability to absorb nutrients so you want to consume nutrient-dense
foods you need to take certain supplements
when you're fasting of course or when you're doing keto to
enhance things b vitamins electrolytes etc and the longer you do
this is going to be easier but also you may need help with some
bile salts bile salts will help extract certain fat soluble vitamins and
nutrients in fats to really satisfy the brain i notice that when certain people
take bile salts they really get satisfied to the point where
they have no hunger no cravings and they're completely satisfied after
they eat anyway those are just some tips thanks

about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know
how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug

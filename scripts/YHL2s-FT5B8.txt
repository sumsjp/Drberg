let's talk about sleep apnea did you realize that 98% of people with sleep apnea have low vitamin d
according to a study that i just read which i'll put a link down below so sleep apnea
or obstructive sleep apnea which is known as osa is majorly linked with a low vitamin d situation
so we're going to discuss this okay so vitamin d significantly reduces inflammation and i'm
talking about the tissues in the back of the throat as well as in the back of the sinuses
many times those tissues are inflamed and that can be the reason why you can't breathe
at night also vitamin d supports an overactive immune system and many times when you have an
overactive immune system you have certain parts of your body certain tissues that are inflamed
the sinuses the back of the throat and even the lungs and that can abstract your breathing and
then vitamin d also has a direct effect on your sleep cycles it helps you get into a deep restful
rejuvenating sleep it helps support the delta wave of your sleep which is the deeper levels of
sleep and without sleep you just don't get enough repair now i just want to differentiate between
the type of vitamin d in this video i'm talking about vitamin d3 not vitamin d2 there's been some
reports that vitamin d2 can actually create insomnia so you always want to make sure you
take vitamin d3 so deficiency in vitamin d affects both sleep apnea and your sleep quality in general
without vitamin d you're more likely to get low back pain which is going to keep you up at night
i mean try to sleep with low back pain it's very difficult also snoring is linked to a vitamin d
deficiency i mean snoring can actually wake you up by itself and if your spouse is deficient in
vitamin d and they're snowing that can keep you up and then i also mentioned less delta wave sleep
the delta wave is where you get this nice deep rejuvenating sleep and without vitamin d it's very
difficult to get into that delta wave sleep now without vitamin d your stress levels are higher
your mood is usually lower and you're not going to be able to sleep with more stress without vitamin
d your cortisol levels will be off and without proper cortisol balance that can affect your
sleep as well cortisol is a stress hormone and too much cortisol keeps you in this flight or
fight mode and also if you don't have enough vitamin d you might tend to grind your teeth
which can affect your sleep cycles as well probably because you have this internal stress
that you're just not able to fully relax i always recommend taking vitamin d with magnesium because
magnesium not only helps the absorption of vitamin d but it can prevent leg and foot cramps at night
which can also keep you up and lastly vitamin d is majorly associated with insulin resistance
so if you have insulin resistance first of all you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin d
very well and if you have low vitamin d your chances of developing insulin resistance go
up because vitamin d is essential in maintaining the beta cell of your pancreas that cell that
produces insulin and vitamin d helps keep the free radicals and the oxidation at a very low state in
that beta cell so in other words to keep this to a short video if you have sleep problems or sleep
apnea just start taking more vitamin d and i would recommend a minimum of 10,000 iu of vitamin d
right before you go to sleep and make sure you take magnesium with it so if you're

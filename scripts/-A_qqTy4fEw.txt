today we're going to talk about the absolute best food
for chronic sinusitis now there's nothing worse than having a
sinus problem year-round that's not related to
allergies all winter long you're stuffy you can't
breathe it affects your sleeping you keep going to the doctor trying this
medication that medication maybe you're on steroids or now they
might want to scrape the inside of your sinuses out which could create some
permanent damage what you have to realize is that you have a very delicate
mucous membrane that lines the sinuses and you have all these friendly bacteria
that are there to protect against invaders
and when that imbalance occurs many times you have an overgrowth
of fungus so this home remedy is especially effective for fungal
infections of the sinuses there was a small study
in 2012 which i'll put a link down below of 20 patients and they found that there
is a shift in microbes especially with this
microbe right here lactobacillus seiki and it just so
happens that this friendly bacteria happens to be in kimchi which is a
korean dish of fermented vegetables which
includes fermented cabbage radish onion garlic chili powder and
ginger and there's a lot of different
variations and different recipes for kimchi
but when you combine cabbage radish onion garlic
chili powder and ginger and you ferment that all the phytonutrients
in these vegetables will have a major effect on pathogens
antibacterial antiviral anti-fungus anti-candida you can actually start
consuming kimchi and i wrote down some brands
that have this friendly bacteria present or you can just take this friendly
bacteria as a product itself and here's a good brand lantos sinus
probiotic powder and fyi i'm not affiliated i don't get
any kickbacks from this company but i have had people that had some pretty
good success with it if you decide to start consuming kimchi
which i highly recommend there's a couple additional things you
may want to try so what you would do is you would take a
little bit of the fluid from kimchi put it in a dish and dilute it by 50%
then what you do is take a q-tip take some of the fluid and rub it into
the inside of your nostrils what that's going to do is going to
provide your mucous membranes with this bacteria now some people can
easily handle the fluid despite the chili powder
other people it may create a very warm sensation
depending on your willingness to give it a try you might want to dilute it first
and just see how it goes apply it a few times a day over a week
or two in addition to consume kimchi to start
building up the floral diversity that you need to
help fight off this fungal infection realize that the fungus in the nose is
the tip of the iceberg the real problem is in your gut and
that's what you need to reestablish all right guys give it a try and put

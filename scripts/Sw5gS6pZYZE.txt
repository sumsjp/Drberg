so I wanted to create a video for those people that are using herbal detox
formulas simply because many times when you take these powerful herbal remedies
especially for things like biofilms which are these colonies of microbes
that hide in these calcium shells and a lot of times you have to take very
powerful herbal remedies to break them up there's other remedies that will kill
microbes fungus or mold here's the problem when you kill some of those
microbes they release little particles and byproducts and that's when your
immune system goes crazy and you start feeling sick you have histamines which
are boutique poisons you get tired and now you're coming down with some problem
in your lung or your sinuses that you didn't have before so that's really what
happens so what you want to do if you're going to do something like that at the
same time you want to take something else to counter the detox reaction you
can take bentonite clay which is just a clay and the word bentonite comes from
the location where they originally found it Fort Benton Wyoming bentonite clay is
really good to kind of deactivate aflatoxins which is a kind of a toxic
mold in certain food products but all three of these are really good for
attaching to heavy metals mycotoxins ammonia pesticides mold mold byproducts
Candida byproducts bacteria byproducts so you can look at them like a sponge
that attaches to them and then pulls them out for the digestion and doesn't
get reabsorbed in your body okay so then we have activated charcoal you don't
want to start consuming the charcoal that you use in your barbecue okay you
want to use something called activated charcoal it's a little different it's a
lot different a lot of people call this the universal antidote they keep it in
their house in case someone is poisoned and they can take this if you take it
right away you can deactivate like 70 percent of that poison so if you take it
30 minutes after you were exposed to that
poison it can actually get rid of 50% of it and if you wait three hours you're
only gonna get rid of 20% so if you wanted to take activated charcoal the
faster you take it the more toxins it's gonna pull out of your body then you
have something called zeolite which is from volcanic ash it's a combination of
certain minerals it's a great chelator which means it attaches to certain
things like heavy metals or byproducts from fungus and it helps to detoxify it
through the body without creating that reaction that you're trying to avoid
so yes you would take the herbal remedy but then you would take this to help
clean up this detox reaction this is also an antioxidant as well as an
anti-inflammatory so I wanted to give you a couple options if you wanted to do
some herbal detox if you want more information about how to strengthen your
immune system you definitely want to check out this video right here

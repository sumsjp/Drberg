so the question is how fast do the benefits occur when someone stops smoking and this may
motivate you to stop smoking within 20 minutes your blood pressure starts to reduce your heart
rate starts to come down within 12 hours you get the full cleansing effect of carbon monoxide
okay what is carbon monoxide well it's slightly different than carbon dioxide but what it will
do it locks up the hemoglobin in your blood and reduces your ability to carry oxygen so we don't
want carbon monoxide in our blood but if you stop smoking within 12 hours that effect goes away now
within 24 hours one full day your risk for heart attack starts to decrease you get an increase in
hdl which is the good cholesterol right we have a decrease in risk of getting a blood clot
and your blood pressure comes down further and you get more oxygen now at 48 hours it's two days you
get the healing or resetting of your nerve endings which is going to increase your ability to smell
and taste now within 72 hours it's three days you deplete your nicotine levels okay so
we get rid of the nicotine but this is where you get withdrawal symptoms
okay irritability moodiness etc so what can you do to counter some of these effects
there are three herbs that you can take that can help one is called lobelia which also can help
decrease coughing loquat is another one which will also help reduce the mucus production and ginseng
now when people have the impulse to smoke because they're addicted they're doing it to actually
reduce some stress so they can breathe better and relax but in reality it's not really decreasing
their stress it's very temporarily fixing the withdrawal symptoms until you feel the urge to
smoke again and if you are a smoker you know that happens pretty quickly because most people smoke
quite a few cigarettes through the day within 30 days your lung function and lung capacity starts
to improve greatly your coughing decreases and you actually have better endurance when you exercise
to three months you get better circulation within nine months
your lung heals to a significant degree the cilia in the lung the cilia are the things that remove
the mucus and the toxins within one year your risk for getting heart disease decreases by 50 percent
within five years your arteries widen and you have a decreased risk of getting a clot now the toxins
that occur when you smoke cause a constriction in your arteries except for one artery and that's the
coronary so it will actually temporarily increase the coronary but constrict all the other arteries
it does also tend to create a vasodilation effect of your lungs so you can breathe a little bit
better but everything else is constricted now within 10 years your risk of getting lung cancer
decreases by 50 now by year 15 if you can make it that long you now have the same risk factors of
cardiovascular disease as a non-smoker hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

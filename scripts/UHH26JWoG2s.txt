so i have a question for you what food do you turn to
when you go under stress go ahead and comment down below is it candy chocolate
what about bread maybe pasta how about cake or cookies cookies and milk what about ice cream
or do you drink alcohol or do you just take a pill here's the problem when you consume carbs
it affects your blood sugars your blood sugars will then end up at a lower state about 30 to 40
minutes after that carb which will then increase more cortisol and cause more stress why was that
because the hormone-like substance dopamine it's actually a neurotransmitter is increased with
the anticipation of a reward like chocolate ice cream etc not when you're consuming it
now dopamine is a pleasure hormone and so when people are under stress or pain they they many
times go for a carbohydrate or they might go for alcohol when in fact they might get a temporary
spike in dopamine right before but not when they're consuming it the truth is as soon as you
start doing it the more stress you're going to be now of course if you're going to take a medication
or drink alcohol you're going to actually block the stress for a period of time but as soon as
it wears off it comes back so i want to give you uh very powerful things you can do as a substitute
for the carbs so there was an interesting study on mice not humans but it does relate
that showed that consuming carbohydrates did not lower cortisol but it did increase dopamine
just a little bit now let me explain dopamine this is a neurotransmitter that gives you some
pleasure so it can counter the sensation of high cortisol but it's not really lowering cortisol
it's just making you feel like it's lowered but the thing about dopamine is that it increases with
the anticipation of a reward not actually when you start eating these rewards it's right before
so that is interesting but here's the problem when we consume the carbs we basically create a blood
sugar problem which eventually increases cortisol so it's really a trap it keeps people in this
stress pretending like you don't have stress stress mode back and forth back and forth back
and forth so i want to give you some very powerful things to do as a substitute for going for these
things when you're stressed number one vitamin b1 if you have not tried this i highly recommend it
you can either take some b1 or better yet get some nutritional yeast you'll be actually quite
surprised how quickly you're going to feel calm and relaxed when you consume nutritional yeast
make sure it doesn't have synthetic vitamins so you want it unfortified with synthetics so b1 is
quite amazing within minutes you're going to feel like a sense of relief okay next one is magnesium
you can do calcium magnesium you can do magnesium citrate there's many other different
types of magnesium you can do but magnesium is really good to help you relax and wind down
and reduce stress lemon balm tea is another favorite one this will make you feel very calm
and it's really good to take before you go to sleep at night l-theanine is an amino acid
that will also help the mental stress part you'll feel really calm very powerful and number five
adaptogens there's many the one that i like is ashwagandha and but there's other ones as well
so an adaptogen will increase your tolerance of stress so here we have it five things you can do
in substitution for these right here thanks for watching before you go if you have a question

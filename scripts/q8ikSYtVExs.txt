so today we're gonna talk about what exercise can do to your immune system if
you're doing regular consistent exercise you can greatly enhance your immune
system number one you'll have a heightened immune surveillance now what
does that mean well on the internal part of your body
you have a barrier it's all the internal skin and the size of that surface area
would be about four hundred square meters the size of two tennis courts and
so you have immune cells they're called phagocytes that are guards that do
surveillance and they are constantly looking for invaders pathogens to
actually come across the barrier to attack them and eat them so exercise
will enhance your phagocyte protection and your defense mechanism number two
it'll increase lymph circulation what is the lymphatic system well you
have a circulatory system where blood is traveling through your arteries and then
it goes down into these small little capillaries where the blood then can
cross into your tissues and it forms lymph
so the lymph system is like your backup system to the circulatory system then it
goes all through the body through your lymph system where then it dumps back
into the circulatory system so your lymph system is a backup to your
circulatory system as well as a place to consolidate immune reactions to keep the
immune reactions out of certain organs and tissues in a place where your immune
system can then fight it more effectively the problem with the lymph
system is it doesn't have a pump exercise will increase the lymph flow
through your body number three exercise delays the
negative effect of aging on your immune system so the more exercise you do the
younger you're going to be because what you have to realize is that as you age
your immune system gets weaker and weaker and weaker in fact the thymus
gland which is on top of the heart which does all the training for the t-cells
literally shrinks down to nothing when you become 80 years old number four
can enhance the immune defense mechanisms as well as how fast your
immune system responds to infection and number five and I think this is probably
the most important thing is exercise can reduce mental stress and mental stress
probably has the biggest influence on weakening your immune system making you
more susceptible to getting an infection when you do exercise in the correct way
you can really lower the stress the trick with exercise is to exercise in a
way so as not to activate too much cortisol and really to do that you just
have to make sure you don't over train and you get enough sleep the healthier
you are and the more recovery you have the less you have to worry about this so
certain people can do ultra marathons and actually not even have that phase
their immune system but other people that have higher levels of cortisol
which by the way suppresses the immune system they can get sick even when they
try to exercise a little bit but for most people doing regular consistent
exercise is extremely beneficial to your immune system thanks for watching

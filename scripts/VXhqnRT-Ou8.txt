let's talk about this very important relationship between your brain and your gut okay it's
bi-directional in other words there's nerve signals that go from your gut to your brain and
back down from your brain to your gut i've done a lot of videos on the autonomic nervous system
and i usually talk about the sympathetic nervous system which is the phletophyte and
the parasympathetic nervous system which is rest and digest okay now the vagus nerve that comes
from your brain stem down into the gut is all parasympathetic but there's a third part of the
autonomic nervous system that i rarely talk about and that is called the entire nervous system there
are more nerves in the entire nervous system than there are in your spinal cord and so if there's
anything going wrong in your gut signals are sent up to the brain and can directly cause anxiety
depression schizophrenia any altered emotional state thus the importance of having a healthy gut
now on the flip side if there's anything going on in the brain as far as stress
that can cause physical problems in your gut like being nauseated having heartburn
stress that originates in your brain can literally cause you to have an ulcer you can get diarrhea
constipation and even cramps in your gut if you are stressed so the entire nervous system
also has about 30 neurotransmitters that it works with 90 of serotonin is made by your gut and this
is why a very common symptom for an ssri which basically allows serotonin to be reuptaked so it
increases the amount of serotonin in the attempts of reducing depression but the biggest side effect
is gi problems now you know why so the microbiome is so vitally important for mental health 21
of people with irritable bowel disease have depression and there's been some real interesting
studies on significant improvement in mood just by taking a simple probiotic and the importance of
eating certain not just probiotics but prebiotics which is the fiber like cabbage like vegetables
that actually feed the microbes and that then help the diversity of your microbiome so it's important
to consume things like sauerkraut kimchi apple cider vinegar can help and occasionally even some
kefir but you have to watch the carbs and also some people are allergic to dairy so that might be
an option for some people but not others anyway thanks for watching this video if you really
are interested in a very unique probiotic i'd put a link down below check it out
hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would love

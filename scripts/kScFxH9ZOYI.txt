now we all think that um alzheimer's is a brain problem that starts in the brain right it
starts in the brain and then it develops in the brain and it's not connected to any other part
but i found some real interesting data that shows that alzheimer's actually originates in your liver
the liver has a function of clearing out something called amyloid b plaques and so
the liver should normally clear this out so it doesn't spread into other parts of your
body but when the liver is compromised and it can't do that whether you have a fatty liver
you have cirrhosis you have inflammation you have diabetes you have metabolic syndrome
whatever then the liver is going to have a very very hard time getting rid of that plaquing and
then it starts developing in the brain but you you won't have symptoms for roughly about 20 years
then you start getting the dementia so it's a process and the problem is that a lot of times
people are waiting until they get a symptom before they do anything about it but i want to
emphasize this very very important connection that you need to know about especially if you
want to prevent alzheimer's so what can you do well number one take care of your liver
right i have a lot of videos on this i'll put some links down below very very important but
let's say for example you're already starting to get dementia you start going in a room you
can't quite remember why you went in there and you start losing your keys and you just start having
memory loss you're getting a little bit older and you're concerned what you need to do is start to
support your liver immediately well there's a couple things you can do there's actually
four really important things to do and so these few articles down below cover these points
and i think it's actually quite fascinating bile salts specifically a type of biosolid called tudka
has the ability to decrease amyloid plaquing and amyloid clearing in the hippocampus which is the
part of the brain that is involved with the relay to your database or remembering certain things
especially spatial memory and by the way if you go on a low fat diet your bio salts dry up
also if you destroy your gut you're not going to be able to make bile salts because your body makes
secondary bile salts from the microbes in your gut that's one of the reasons why there's a big
connection between your gut and your brain what's going on down here is affecting up
here number two vitamin d and by the way if you don't have bile salts or not enough bile salts
you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin d so there's a big connection between vitamin
d and clearing out amyloid plaquing also vitamin d is very very important in the liver
and the liver is part of the process where the vitamin d gets activated
it's also an organ that you help store vitamin d but vitamin d is very very important all
right number three silly marin that's milk thistle has the capacity to clear out amyloid
plaquing so if you're getting dementia or you have alzheimer's you should be taking all these
including the next point which is intermittent fasting intermittent fasting helps clear out the
amyloid plaquing why because your body starts to perform autophagy which is a recycling
of proteins that you don't need and you'd have to do at least 18 hours of fasting to get into
autophagy but very very important if you want to clear out these proteins all right thanks
for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but
what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing
this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist
your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

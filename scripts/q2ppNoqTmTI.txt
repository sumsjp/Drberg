this is a big confusion that people have they they think that the liver is filled with toxins okay
like it stores toxins like a sponge the liver does not store toxins it doesn't store poisons
it is a filter but what it really does is it converts poisons okay into harmless particles
and that's called bile transformation it takes these chemicals which is could be
secondhand smoke or poisons or whatever from the environment or drugs that a person takes
or pesticides or whatever those are fat soluble so there are certain enzymes in the liver made by the
liver cells that convert those fat soluble toxins into water-soluble particles it's called phase 1
phase 2 detoxification and it all gets eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of
bile so these enzymes decrease the half-life of these chemicals and they decrease the accumulation
of the chemicals in your body and so basically they neutralize the effect of drugs alcohol
poisons etc now when you consume cruciferous vegetables you can stimulate and increase these
enzymes but other vegetables like carrots celery parsley do not stimulate these enzymes the liver
does store nutrients like b12 vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e vitamin k iron copper folic acid but
it doesn't store toxins hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

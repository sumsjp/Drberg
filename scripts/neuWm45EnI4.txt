let's answer the question what is the first sign of a zinc
deficiency now clinically when you're deficient in zinc all sorts of things happen a lack of growth
anorexia tissue necrosis you can actually get tissue dying from a lack of zinc
all sorts of skin issues all sorts of digestive issues infection viruses bacteria hair loss ulcers
and the list goes on and on you don't have a major deficiency but you're just starting to become
deficient in zinc well to answer that we need to kind of look at some other data number one
when you're low in zinc you will have a lowered amount of very specific antioxidants glutathione
alpha tocopherol and catalase which has to do with the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide
so in other words very powerful antioxidants in our bodies are dependent on
zinc and without zinc you will not be able to produce these in sufficient amounts
now there's some additional information i want to share with you cardiac tissue
or heart tissue is the highest producer of something called ross so just think about ross as
something that creates a lot of oxidation and the heart cells as a tissue if we compare it to other
tissues in the body has one the lowest antioxidant capacity now what does that mean so in other words
it becomes very susceptible to becoming damaged this is probably why the number one cause of death
is heart disease the heart is not able to repair effectively and the first symptom is you're going
to get shortness of breath upon exertion so let's say you start to exercise or you run up the stairs
and you're out of breath easily that would be the first symptom of a zinc deficiency
so i remember as a kid living on sugar outside playing and noticing i was having a difficult time
running up a hill i was like out of breath very easily i had no clue on what that was but it was
probably a zinc deficiency due to all the sugar that was consuming and so if you have that symptom

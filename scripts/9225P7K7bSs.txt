hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about the adrenal glands now I have a lot
of different videos on different aspects of the adrenal but I don't think I have a video just
on the basics of what the adrenal glands do now they're two glands right on top of the kidney
right down here and they are stress gland so the body will respond to physical and mental stress
with the help of the adrenal gland so the adrenal glands basically adapt the different parts of your
body to a stress so it can cope for example if you're being chased by a tiger the adrenal gland
will produce hormones to activate more blood flow to the muscle increase heart rate increase
blood pressure mental acuity so you're all set to prepare yourself for flight run away or fight okay
so the adrenal gland is very unique because it is an outside in an inside the outside is all gland
tissue the inside is not gland tissue it's nerve tissue it's interesting so you have this gland
wrapped around a nerve bundle and the nerve bundle makes neurotransmitters and probably because of
its location it can have quick access to the heart and different organs because it's right
in the center of the body but it makes adrenaline noradrenaline which is a pre adrenaline hormone
and also makes catecholamines which are things like dopamine serotonin GABA all the different
neurotransmitters are made there and it's part of the sympathetic nervous system which again is
the flight or fight mechanism it's right inside the adrenal now the outside has primarily three
categories of hormones maybe four if you want to classify them a little differently the first
one is called glucocorticoids which is basically cortisol and by the way all these hormones are our
steroids that are made from cholesterol that's why you need a certain amount of cholesterol
to make them specially under stress but the glucocorticoids the name gives it away glucose
okay they're basically they're hormones that do influence blood sugars okay so that's why if
you have too much of that hormone you can end up becoming a diabetic because it produces it turns
basically things into sugar pretty quickly your own muscle so it's for it makes quick energy so
if it has too much it's going to trigger insulin and you're going to get all sorts of issues this
is the one that I talked about producing belly fat but really only through insulin because it
increases insulin so insulin is the main core main hormone that does it but it's cortisol
that can trigger it so cortisol affects stress blood Sugar's immune suppression now think about
all the autoimmune diseases out there you know where your body attacks its own tissue and then
what's the treatment for all of them steroids prednisone what's a steroid an adrenal hormone
cortisol so your own body is supposed to produce hormones to counter that and suppress stress in
fact if you look at the remedy prednisone in what conditions it treats all sorts of skin problems
pain syndromes inflammatory conditions immune conditions organ rejection type of hormone so
everything with immune suppression so it affects the immune system big-time if the adrenal glands
are weakened it put makes you susceptible to viruses so it's really an important hormone it
actually affects bone so if you have too much of this hormone you can have bone loss controls
vitamin D levels so you could be low in vitamin D from the adrenal being stressed out so it does a
lot ok so the next one is mineral corticoids that would be a hormone that controls the electrolytes
potassium calcium magnesium chloride sodium so it really controls the electrolytes and the sodium
fluid balance in the body and that's one of the reasons why people might get high blood
pressure they give you a diuretic because you have a sodium imbalance it's affecting
this hormone right here the name of it is called aldosterone okay then we have androgens which is
hormones females have androgens men have more but the adrenal gland also produces androgens
it also produces estrogen interesting so when a female goes through menopause these renal gland
literally has to work a little harder to back up the loss of the ovarian function and that's
where it comes from then adrenal also then you have DHEA which is kind of a precursor
a hormone that turns into these other hormones so if you're low and DHEA which most people are
as they age you lose your vitality you lose your energy your ability to sleep but it's
really the adrenal gland so what do people do they live on stimulants they start to try to
live on coffee and things to wake them up 5-hour energy drinks to try to wake them up the problem
is the stimulants kind of stimulate adrenal keep there going but then it kind of burns out over
more and you become adrenal fatigue and you're tired and you're cut now you can't sleep and the
last thing is make sure when you lead you have enough potassium in the food because potassium
is a calming mineral it relaxes the adrenal and when you're deficient in potassium everything kind
of speeds right up alright thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report

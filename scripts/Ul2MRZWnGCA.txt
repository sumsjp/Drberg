I want to talk about magnesium and how long it stays in your body now the
certain minerals that go through the body pretty quickly other minerals don't
like for example sodium iron and calcium tend to be retained in the body but
magnesium potassium and zinc are not held very long now what determines the
retention or the recycling of potassium is how healthy your kidneys are if your
kidneys are very very healthy you may only lose you know half of a percent
versus if they're very very unhealthy you will lose a lot more there's a huge
gap on how much your body is going to hold versus excrete and because the
kidneys have the ability to get rid of excess magnesium magnesium is rarely
toxic to the body but you're going to get rid of between 0.5 and 70% of your
magnesium within a 24-hour period so it's very important to keep the
magnesium coming in the body the RDAs for a female for magnesium are between
310 and 360 and a male it's 400 to 420 they have to realize the RDAs are only
there to prevent deficiencies they're not the dose that you should normally
have to maintain a healthy body so these numbers should be a lot higher in fact I
think they should be at least 500 to 600 milligrams per day but the average
American is only consuming between 2 to 300 milligrams per day now if we also
add in all the other diseases like for example diabetes the need for magnesium
goes way way up because you simply do not retain magnesium if you have blood
sugar problems also if you're drinking a lot of alcohol that is going to severely
decrease the ability to hold magnesium now when you consume magnesium from the
diet you're only really absorbing between 24 to 76 percent of the
magnesium from the food and that really varies because if there's digestive
damage in your colon that could be a factor if there's a pH deficiency of
Hydrochloric acid in your stomach that can also
alter your absorption and there's other reasons as well about 50% of all the
magnesium in your body is stored in your bone it's a reservoir so if you're not
eating a lot of food with magnesium your body will just pull it from the bone
that could be a problem if you keep doing them and some of it is stored in
the muscle probably the number one symptom of the magnesium deficiency is
fatigue because your mitochondria the energy factories of your cells need
magnesium to create ATP which is the energy currency of the body so we need
magnesium for energy if you crave chocolate you could be deficient because
there's a lot of magnesium in chocolate and your body will tend to crave those
things that have a certain nutrient than it's trying to pull in also realize that
99% of all the magnesium your body is inside the cell and only 1% is outside
the cell so if you were to get a test for magnesium in your blood
you really would not get the accurate picture of what's going on you want to
get an intracellular test I'll put a link down below of a company that can
test your your magnesium it's intracellular testing why are you
deficient in magnesium well number one it's the empty calories if you're
consuming refined foods that strip all the magnesium out that's the number one
reason why people are deficient in magnesium just basically refined sugars
grains things like that the next reason is they're consuming a lot of phytates
phytates are located in the fiber of grains so if you eat a lot of oatmeal
which by the way has a good amount of magnesium you're not going to be able to
absorb it because of the phytates phytates bind the magnesium in and will
not let you absorb that magnesium so if you're consuming wheat products other
grains legumes they're all high in phytates and typically whole grain
cereal has good about of magnesium but it's loaded with phytates
so you're not getting the magnesium if you
kidney damage that's gonna alter your ability to absorb magnesium now you
might say well I don't have kidney damage
well did you realize that the number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes and
90% of people that are pre-diabetic don't even know they're pre-diabetic and
that probably 70% of the population has insulin resistance which is a pre
pre-diabetes situation and if you have insulin resistance that not only could
block magnesium from be going in the body but also over time it can lead to
some kidney problems and the last reason why people are deficient is they don't
consume enough chlorophyll type foods chlorophyll at the center of it has
magnesium it's similar to our blood chemistry where we have iron but
chlorophyll it's like the blood of the plant so if you're not consuming a lot
of vegetables and salads that could be another common source of why you need
more magnesium so one of the first symptoms you'd get from a magnesium
deficiency would be fatigue another one would be a palpitation or your heart
starts to go out of rhythm your muscles feel weak and there's quite a few
symptoms if you want more information about the symptoms of the magnesium
deficiency I put that video up right here check it out

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I'm going to talk about the shocking truth about protein bars
now when you go to a health of store or even a GNC you'll see all these protein bars and maybe you
think they're healthy but a lot of them contains soy protein isolates you don't want to consume
that first of all it's GMO secondly it's very estrogenic and it's hard on the liver it's not
the type of soy that even the Japanese or Chinese actually consume they do fermented soy they
don't do the soy protein powder creates a lot of problems for you so that's number one number two
even worse these so-called protein bars are really sugar bars in disguise I'm an average protein bar
has about 20 to 29 pull our 30 grams of sugar per bar that's crazy amount that is like insane amount
of sugar and it's it with GABA nectar corn syrup brown syrup and you might think oh yeah brown
syrup is better than sugar it's actually no it's all the same fructose Multi dextran evaporated
cane sugar that's crazy so if you combine this sugar with the protein if you watch them my other
videos you're gonna spike insulin way higher than if you consume these separate so the combination
of sugar with protein together exaggerated the spike in insulin so it's not a weight-loss thing
it's great if you want to gain weight but in an unhealthy way I mean also if you like you see
these and I'll do a video on these these weight gainers so you get go to GNC and you see these big
buckets and I actually bought some when I was in my 20s trying to gain weight and you'd get
these buckets and you and they're just loaded with protein and sugar high fructose corn syrup tons
of sugar it's a great way to cause diabetes and then the last thing that they have is synthetic
vitamins they so they throw a bunch of synthetic vitamins and you think you're getting some great
vitamins they're all synthetic it's crappy so what I think that these protein bars are missing is the
healthy fat because you want to consume a protein bar right with a meal not in between but you want
to add the fat so if they had protein with that that would be the ideal scene but they're all low
fat they have like no fat they combine the sugar it's basically they should they should call them
the insulin bars okay yeah so leave the labels and also I have a quiz below if you want to find out
what's causing any of your health problems take the quiz below check it out thanks for watching

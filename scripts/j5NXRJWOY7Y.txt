so i wanted to create a video to talk about dietary fats
and what specific type of fat your body thrives on
so the definition of thrive means survive very well on because there's a
lot of different fats and it's very confusing
and so let's just take a look at this from the viewpoint of
the size of the fat you have short chain fatty acids
medium chain fatty acids and then you have long chain fatty acids and then you
also have another category over here which i'm not going to get into but it's
a very long chain fatty acids let's just try to make
this really really simple these right here are made from
fiber so your microbes actually break them down and turn them into
short chain fatty acids okay right here butyrate is one
and then it feeds your colon cells it also
decreases your risk for cancer it will also
help with insulin resistance that's short chain fatty acids then we get
medium chain fatty acids as in mct oil now also realize that
some of the fats that provide this are over here too
like there's some in butter coconut oil palm oil can make mct fats
now the unique thing about medium chain fatty acids
is that it doesn't require bile to get absorbed so if someone has no
gallbladder or they have a liver problem like
cirrhosis especially or they have some type of malabsorption
issue or they just don't have enough bile then
this would be a really good source of fat for fuel energy that's a good thing
to thrive on right now let's talk about long chain fatty
acids animal fats butter coconut oil palm oil
vegetable oils nut oils even seed oils and omega-3 fatty acids
these fats provide not only fuel and certain elements for structural parts of
our body but also they provide something called
the essential fatty acids okay that's the omega fatty
acids and you have three and six now i don't want to get
into six because i really think that the amount of omega-6 fatty acids that
we need is a lot less important than the omega-3 and i've
done a video on that and i'll put the link down below
but the most important fat out of all of these right here is right here
omega-3 fatty acids epa and dha
because a good portion of your brain and your retina
needs this type of fat also this is anti-inflammatory and the majority of
the population is very very very low in this right here
so what dietary fat does your body really thrive on
it's right here and you get this from fish oils cod liver oil
salmon you can even get it from algae now these other fats do provide energy
and they feed your colon but if you lower your carb your body
actually will get its energy from your own body fat
it won't necessarily be dependent on the dietary fat
until you run out but most people have enough of that out of all the fats
that we need the one that's most important is right here

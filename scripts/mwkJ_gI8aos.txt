hey guys I wanted to create a short video on this amazing root called ginger
now ginger is mainly for any type of GI stress if your nauseated
you have vomiting you have inflamed colon this is what you need to consume
you can take in pill form I like to do it fresh but anything to do with the
digestive disruption this will actually fix it pretty fast actually so a couple
ways I take it I put this on my salad a lot and you just take off the outer
coating and I shave it into my salad so I might shave like like a little about
this much off into my salad and I'll also sometimes shave like beet and this
and it tastes really good also I add it to water you can actually
put this in your water with lemon and drink it it makes a nice little spicy
drink I like to put the carbonated Pellegrino with it and it's kind of like
my little root beer I might put a little drop of stevia in there or you can just
add it to vegetables in general so go ahead and try this and give me your
comments below I'll see in the next video hey guys thank you so much for
watching I really appreciate it please click the share button below and I will
see you in the next video

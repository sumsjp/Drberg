let's talk about the healthiest oils to use when you're deep frying okay now the oils
that you should avoid when deep frying are the unsaturated type because those are very unstable
and they oxidize very easily especially when you heat them and that would be the soy oil the canola
the corn the cotton seed the sunflower seed oil the safflower seed oil as well as the peanut oil
and so there's a certain chemical compound that's created when you heat or fry these
unsaturated very delicate oils it's a bit of a mouthful but it's advanced lipid
oxidation end products now and these are compounds that have negative effects on your heart
and there's even a chance that it can increase your risk for getting certain types of cancer
and some of the effects are more damaging than consuming sugar there's also a study
that i included down below that demonstrated that it can slow down autophagy which is the recycling
of all damaged proteins in the body and your mitochondria so that's not good
all right so here are the best oils to use when you're de-frying things coconut oil or
palm oil some people don't like to use palm oil then great then don't use it use coconut oil
tallow that is uh fat from beef i recommend doing the grass fed beef fat versus the grain fed
beef fat because it's going to be healthier talo is an ingredient that we used to use
way back it's loaded with vitamin b3 niacin it's actually it's a good fat to fry with number three
ghee not butter but ghee this is clarified butter they filter out all the salads and they get rid
of those and you're just having this pure fat it's a very good fat to fry with number four olive oil
now even though the olive oil does have some unsaturated fats it seems to be okay for cooking
as long as you keep it below about 400 degrees and avocado oil is another oil that you can
fry with that seems to be fairly stable but these fats will not turn into this compound
and so they're more stable so they're not going to oxidize as fast and they're going to be safer when
they're heated all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and

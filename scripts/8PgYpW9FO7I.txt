all right let's talk about sugar versus wheat which one is less healthy and that's a difficult
one because they're very very close let's start with wheat what's interesting about wheat is
it has a gi glycemic index response of 72 okay compared to sugar which has a glycemic index of 59
so wheat is significantly higher on the glycemic index now we're going to get into why that is
in a minute but what you have to realize is the modern day wheat is very very different
than it was years ago it's been severely modified to produce a different type of gluten which is
the protein in grain and this type of gluten can now increase the risk of getting celiac by four
times now the main starch in modern day wheat is something called amylopectin a so 75% of the starch
is this compound now the problem with amylopectin a is it triggers the small ldl the type of ldl
that can create inflammation and even plaquing this starch is highly digestible and it can break
down very quick and spike your blood sugars so this is why it's very high in the glycemic
index and yes it does contribute to diabetes and heart disease and many other issues like
a fatty liver it also has the potential to change the bowel microbes to increase more fungus candida
it can increase your risk of getting sibo small intestinal bacteria overgrowth because fungus
loves this type of starch now because wheat has a combination of carbohydrate and protein
it can really spike something called glycation which is the process where you irreversibly
damage certain proteins in the body now wheat also is a grain that has phytates which block zinc
calcium magnesium and also bind with iron now if we switch gears to sugar and i'm talking
about sucrose which is table sugar you have 50% of it being fructose and 50% of it being glucose
now this is why it's lower on the glycemic index because fructose is very very different than
glucose fructose is not taken up by all of your cells like glucose fructose can only be dealt with
by your liver and so it may not have an immediate effect on your blood sugars
but all this fructose being crammed down to your liver if you have insulin resistance will
start being converted over into fat it's going to start creating a fatty liver and so even though
it's slightly lower on the glycemic index it's even more damaging to your liver so table sugar
can increase your risk of getting gout diabetes heart disease a fatty liver and also because it's
refined depletes potassium calcium it competes for vitamin c it depletes zinc and b vitamins
especially vitamin b1 so the question is which one is worse well they're both bad
but if i were to pick one that's worse i would say wheat is slightly worse because
it has more phytates it creates more glycation and because it has gluten where sucrose doesn't
it can really mess up and irritate the gi system and create more inflammation all

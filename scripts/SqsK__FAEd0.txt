let's answer the question why does vitamin D actually help someone with
hypertension and by the way anything they I say is not meant to replace your
medical care don't stop taking your drugs unless you check with your doctor
but if you are a medication and you're not taking vitamin D then you might want
to consider taking it especially after what I'm going to tell you there is a
tremendous amount of research which I'll put down below on this one topic one of
the most commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension is an ACE inhibitor now I
just released a video on the ACE receptor as it relates to COVID-19 you
should check that out if you haven't seen it hypertension is one of the top
risk factors for having complications from COVID-19 and out of all the people
that are taking medication for hypertension 48% of them are taking ace
inhibitors as the first medication to help them lower the pressure alright
what is a stand for angiotensin converting enzyme so this drug inhibits
this enzyme and this enzyme relates to an entire system in your body which is
called renin-angiotensin system RAS I don't want to explain anything else
other than this system helps regulate blood pressure fluid balance electrolyte
balance so that's all you need to do the next thing to know is this vitamin D
lowers this system tons and tons of research ok now my thought is that and
this is just my theory that the reason why this is high in the first place is
the person has a vitamin D deficiency now why do I say that because 75% of the
population has some level of deficiency with vitamin D so this is something you
definitely want to research yourself and bring up to your doctor if you're on
medication this is what I would recommend ten thousand international
units to 20 thousand international units of vitamin d3 with vitamin k2
I mean k2 works with vitamin D this alone will help to slow down the calcium
buildup in the arteries so this is very very good as well
but if you're going to take this amount here take a hundred micrograms if you're
going to take this amount take 200 micrograms of k2 ok now if someone tells
you that that much vitamin D is toxic or it's gonna create a problem just have
them show you evidence of that there's actually no evidence of that whatsoever
I mean if they tell you it's gonna create high calcium in the blood it's
called hypercalcemia just have them show your reference they won't be able to
find it the only reference on that shows that if you're taking like over a
hundred thousand international units of vitamin D for a long period of time
potentially it could create kidney stones but if you're taking this amount
I've never seen anything negative about that alright if you were also to add
some potassium to this I think you would even be more successful and I'm talking
a thousand milligrams a day because a potassium deficiency will cause high
blood pressure as well in fact it will cause the arteries to stiffen if you're
deficient in potassium and you can get a lot of potassium if you also consume a
large amount of greens like salad or vegetables so anyway I just wanted to
bring this up if you weren't aware of vitamin D and relationship to blood
pressure you definitely need to know about it because it's such an
inexpensive solution to a very common problem

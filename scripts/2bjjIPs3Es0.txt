hey guys it's me again in this video we're going to talk about a very interesting hormone called
igf-1 and if you ever heard of that it stands for insulin like growth factor number one now let me
just kind of give you some background on what this hormone is in the brain you have this little gland
called the pituitary all right and the pituitary makes growth hormone growth hormone is sent down
to the liver where then liver is triggered will trigger this hormone to be produced by GF so igf-1
is an extension of growth hormone so whatever growth homas doing IGF is doing you kind of
look at it like a GF is the worker bee that's can that is instructed by a growth on them okay now
the chemistry of growth hormone is very similar to insulin lust the name in some like growth factor
right and in what happens in the liver IG f is made and then you have the pancreas makes insulin
so you have the pancreas that makes influence and the liver that makes IGF right flow these
two hormones work together back and forth back and forth to determine what fuel you're going
to use if insulin is kicked in when you're eating you're going to use sugar fuel when you don't eat
when you fast you're going to use fat fuel okay you're going to use some stored sugar but mainly
fat fuel so we have this determination of if you want to burn sugar or fat so IGF works when you're
not eating and insulin works when you're eating okay so that's the kind of the back and forth but
to see the IGF is a hundred times greater than insulin so for example over time if you destroy
your liver or the liver gets like fatty you lose the capacity to make IGF which then forces your
body to make more insulin so that's the the diabetic situation so the liver is very very
vital in protecting you against diabetes now the thing the three big things that lower IGF
our insulin stress which is cortisol and estrogen okay and what happens is it's triggered by protein
now just a moderate amount of protein because if you have too much protein you'll trigger
insulin so a small amount of protein between three and six ounces you will trigger IGF all
right exercise intense exercise will trigger IGF fasting or intermittent fasting will trigger IGF
sleeping high quality sleep will trigger I GF alright so I just want to kind of give you a
little background and what this hormone is and it does help you in anti-aging so again start eating
those vegetables those cruciferous vegetables start taking care of your liver do everything
you can to maintain the liver function and to keep your IGF very very high thanks for watching

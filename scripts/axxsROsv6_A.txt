i wanted to talk about the relationship between calcium and your cardiovascular system most people
associate calcium with your bones right you need calcium to build healthy bones but calcium has
many other different purposes in the body and one use is used as a communication particle or
a messenger between cells it's also used in the clotting process to help form clots and it's a
major electrolyte in the ability for the muscle to contract as well as in the relaxation process
so calcium has many different purposes one of the unique things about calcium it's something that
doesn't get eliminated in the body too quickly like other minerals like potassium for example
if you have too much potassium your body will get rid of it real quick if your body has too much
magnesium it will get rid of that and even if you have too much sodium you will get rid of sodium
but there's certain minerals like calcium and even iron that your body tends to accumulate and if you
have too much of it you're kind of stuck with it for a while now the symptoms of too much calcium
in the body versus too little calcium are equally as bad you want just the right amount you don't
want too much you don't want too little if you have too much that's called hypercalcemia if you
have too little that's called hypocalcemia and each one of them has its own series of symptoms
but what's common about hyper and hypocalcemia is arrhythmias okay so if you have too much or too
little your heart tends to develop palpitations cardiac arrhythmias and it just loses its rhythm
so this is one of the problems if someone has cardiac arrhythmias do you give someone more
calcium or do you avoid calcium and sometimes you have to evaluate what the person is taking
many women are taking way too much calcium in their supplements especially if they're
in menopause or after menopause they're taking like one to two thousand milligrams of calcium
which i think is way too much calcium can then put them at risk for heart attacks because it's
just too much calcium and the type of calcium they're taking is the wrong type of calcium
they're taking calcium carbonate which is limestone you'd be better off chewing
on the cement outside because it's just it's consuming rocks it doesn't get absorbed too well
a much better idea would be to get your calcium from food dairy is one good source but there's
many other different sources of calcium and i'm going to put a link down below if you want
more data on that the other thing that happens during menopause is that you lose your estrogen
and because estrogen becomes deficient not to mention progesterone as well you then also lose
your ability to regulate calcium to a certain degree so there's a very direct relationship
between estrogen deficiency and calcium and that's one of the reasons why women when they go through
menopause they start developing osteopenia or osteoporosis simply because they lose
the estrogen control over calcium and so the thing not to do is just to start loading up with calcium
what might be a better idea is to take something like dhea which is the precursor for building up
more estrogen so that way that you can then absorb more calcium but if you take too much of dhea
that can raise your testosterone so just make sure you don't take any more than 10 to 15 milligrams
i don't want to get sidetracked but sometimes it's a little bit complex to try to figure all
these things out because if you raise one thing something else will then get raised i think if
you're eating a healthy diet you're on healthy keto calcium is rarely going to be a problem it's
pretty easy to get calcium in various foods it's in vegetables it's in other foods it's in nuts
it's definitely in dairy i think what's more of a problem is vitamin d vitamin d helps you absorb
calcium by a factor of 20x so with vitamin d your absorption of calcium goes up by
20 times and the majority of the population is so deficient in vitamin d i would say at least
70 percent of the population is deficient vitamin d and that's really where the problem is when
we're dealing with calcium not the calcium itself so i just wanted to talk about this interesting
relationship between calcium and cardiovascular function and we're dealing with supplements
calcium is one mineral that i wouldn't necessarily take as a standalone supplement all right

today we're going to talk about the first symptom of a fatty liver and that is malaise
now what is malaise it's this general discomfort uneasiness type feeling you're feeling like you're
coming down with something it's an absence of feeling good and malaise is not very specific to
a certain part of the body it's kind of all over it's kind of vague you're not sure where it is
and you feel a little bit of weakness what's happening is your immune system is
activated there are cytokines which are certain proteins that are activating the immune system
at a certain level not enough for an infection but just enough to make you feel like you could
be coming down with something now malaise is many times also associated with fatigue
but it's not fatigue but the first symptom that occurs with a fatty liver is malaise with the
second symptom being more right shoulder pain because the liver is on the right side and when
it starts swelling up it can put pressure into the right side and cause discomfort on the right side
now there are other causes of malaise like an infection or low blood sugar caffeine withdrawal
or the flu and of course like i said a fatty liver once your way to know that you have fat and
liver is just by looking down and if you can't see your feet because your gut is sticking out
you definitely have a fatty liver now in the past i've created a lot of videos in the liver so i
put some links down below of the most important ones with the exact diet that you should be on
if you have a liver problem and in a recent video i talked about adding probiotics to your diet if
you have a fatty liver because that is going to reduce the immune response and you'll start
feeling better right away but there's a lot more that can be done so if you suspect a fatty liver

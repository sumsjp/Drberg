hey guys I recently had a question about alkaline water what did I think about it
so I wanted to do a quick video on that okay now normally when you buy certain
types of bottled water or artesian water or well water or spring water it comes
alkalyn okay but the reason why it's alkaline is because of the alkaline
minerals magnesium calcium and potassium and other minerals as well that's what
makes it alkaline okay and also bicarbonates which is alkaline so that's a
good thing but when you actually have a machine that makes your water alkaline
it's not by adding minerals it's by splitting apart the water molecules with
electricity to artificially make the water alkaline now in 29 years of
practice I have had quite a few people come in that have used the alkaline
water okay and I have a machine that measures the pH in the urine and I would
notice that a high percentage of these people would come in with a pH of 9 in
the urine now normally in the urine it should be 5 or 6 but never this high 9 9
is really alkaline okay now the problem with having your urine being that high
in a pH that alkaline is that you don't have any protection against the microbes
so microbes can grow in the body a lot more
it's one of the purposes of having acidic urine so we can kill off the
microbes so I do know that alkaline water does alter chemistry in not a good
way there's three fluids in the body that normally should be acid the stomach
which should be extremely acid the large bowel and the urine okay and those
fluids need to be acid for a reason even the stomach should be acid for a reason
to help you break down protein to help you absorb minerals and also to kill
microbes so when you consume alkaline water which is unnatural to the body it
can neutralize the different acidic fluids in the body and that can create
problems with digestion large bowel which is digestion and even your urine
as well so your microbes can actually increase also it's
going to affect the absorption of electrolytes and your heart is the key
organ that needs these key electrolytes in the right balance so if you're going
to neutralize the ph and throw up the electrolytes it could create a problem
with the heart so that's a long answer to I would not recommend alkaline water
make sure you if you want alkaline water get it naturally alkaline not
artificially thanks for watching hey you know what I just want to say something
only thirty percent of the people that watch this video actually make it
this far and you did so I really appreciate you thank you so much

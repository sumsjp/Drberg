hey I'm back with another video there's a very common problem that keeps coming
up over and over and over I read a lot of your comments and the topic of today
is this I'm doing keto and intermittent fasting but I still crave certain things
and I'm still hungry when I'm fasting what do I do well let's
talk about that if you're doing the exact plan the plan that I laid out your
cravings will go down to zero and your hunger will go down to zero between the
meals in fact yesterday I was fasting until 3 o'clock in the afternoon I was
absolutely so satisfied I was not hungry even at 3 o'clock it felt like I just
ate like I was filled my body was actually burning fat all day long I felt
great I had no desire to eat whatsoever if you're trying to lose weight and
you're not hungry like that keep going as long as you can problem I have is if
I don't consume two large meals a day I tend to get a little too thin I could
potentially have a lot more food in that one meal but I just cannot cram in
thirty four hundred calories in one meal I just can't do it
I'm usually eating at 3 or 3:30 even though I am not hungry I actually feel
way better when I don't eat versus when I eat what happens when you're doing the
right program and you're fasting is your body has converted a hundred percent
over to the state of ketosis now realize that if your body needs any glucose or
sugar at all it will easily make it from fat from ketones from protein
you don't need glucose you don't need carbs here's the thing that I run into
over and over and over again now just out of the blue you're just hungry or
you're craving something reflect back to yesterday what did you eat were you
doing sorta keto was there anything that you ate that maybe you shouldn't have
eaten are you eating keto friendly foods that have maltodextrin or tapioca
these definitely are not keto even though people claim they are keto
friendly a little a pasta bread fruit like a banana or
even some dates will definitely create hunger and cravings then next day that's
just what's gonna happen it's nearly always too many carbs the day before if
you stay consistent each and every day your hunger goes down to zero and you
have no cravings now it could also be stress stress can also release glucose
that's stored in your liver so that's another possibility also your sleep if
your sleep is poor that can affect your blood sugars as well you see hunger
cravings are the absolute best way to know that it's working and once your
appetite goes away it's very very sustaining you can stick with this thing
for a very long period of time I just can't imagine someone being on a diet
with hunger and with cravings and that's pretty much the majority of people who
diet and that's really really tough I don't know how they do it this diet
keto and intermittent fasting you're in the state of producing high amounts of
ketones and one last thing if you're craving salt just consume salt without
the carbohydrates as in a french fry potato chip or some other salty crunchy
carbohydrate if you haven't seen my beginner video on keto I put it right

hi guys in this video we're going to talk about the two main causes of hair-loss okay number
one its nutritional deficiency and number two it has nothing to do with nutrition it's a hormone
problem okay but this idea of taking shampoo or conditioner that has B vitamins or collagen to
somehow I think that's going to absorb in your hair and do any good it really doesn't work you
have to take it orally or make sure you're not deficient okay so so let's talk about first about
the vitamin deficiencies that occur with hair and it could be multiple but you can have a vitamin C
deficiency vitamin C is in all the leafy greens vitamin C helps collagen hair is a collagen it's
a type of collagen is called keratin it's like a fibrous real tough collagen so you also need trace
minerals this one is really really important in the manufacturing of protein in the body if
you want hair skin nails arteries bone okay so we need the trace minerals for that especially
your muscles so trace minerals are those minerals needed in very small amounts unfortunately they're
not in our foods because they're not in our soil anymore so unless you're consuming like sea kelp
or some type of trace mineral blend you're not going to have it in your diet and that is a big
reason for hair loss okay now excellent collagen so the type of collagen that someone needs to
regrow their hair is is a type 1 and type 3 okay so that would be the type of collagen that you
would need to support that and then silica silica is an interesting element and you don't want to
get it you want to get this in a like a food base or an herb like a plant base okay horse
tail the plant called horse tail is loaded with silica but silica is kind of like the probably
most abundant elements in the body it helps in the manufacturing of collagen hair nails skin
it makes it very very shiny and tough and very healthy and prevents wrinkles makes your nails
really strong makes the hair from protected against splitting and then you have the B
vitamins it's interesting with B vitamins and the trace minerals work with a lot of skin problems a
lot of hair problems because if you're deficient with the vitamins your hair is going to fall out
okay specifically biotin and some of the other B vitamins okay what the best way to get to B
vitamins is through nutritional yeast okay get them from nutritional yeast so that we all the
vitamin deficiencies that you could have - that could create hair loss all right now you also
have alopecia with this autoimmune problem and you also have male pattern baldness or receding hair
that is high levels of DHT DHT is a very powerful testosterone and what happens there's an enzyme
in your body that converts testosterone into this powerful DHT - an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase
just in case you wanted to know that and if you get a an enzyme inhibitor like stinging nettle
root it's called stinging nettle root which is one of the top ones that I recommend that will
reduce DHT okay and that helps or Monali like to get your hair back it's also good for prostate
it's also good for a facial hair okay so it's and it's also good for acne all right so now
I actually have a product that has every single one of these ingredients in it and you can get
more information below if you're interested but the trace minerals are a plant base the collagen
is wild-caught fish skin guys type 1 and type 3 the silica is from horsetail okay which is a
plant base and the biotin is not excessively high like a lot of times people buy up the biotin in
like 10,000 IU's and then they start getting other side effects like acne that's because they're not
getting divided the B vitamins in the natural complex so I actually have biotin and the B
vitamins in the natural complex so you won't get other side effects and then I put this thing in
to actually lower the DHT and it has a food based vitamin C so you can check it out this link down
below if you're interested but I just wanted to kind of cover it's real simple if you just
plug in nutrition if that's what it is or if you have alopecia or male pattern baldness you would
want to add the stinging other roots so thank you so much for watching hey guys thank you so

now this is going to be an interesting video because what i thought was true
was absolutely not true it was completely false i thought one of the reasons why our foods were
deficient in nutrients was because the soil was deficient in minerals okay that's what i thought
but i recently found out that is absolutely not true our soils are not depleted of minerals
okay interesting book uh environmental soil chemistry second edition it's like 105 very
very expensive textbook by donald sparks this is what he found he did soil samples around the world
okay he compiled all this data and he found that the concentration of minerals
of an average sample of soil demonstrated plenty of nutrients okay now this actually
was a shocker and i was like at first i'm like this can't be this there's no way this could be
but let's go on there's another document that i want to talk about is by dr david johnson
and he's part of the institute for sustainable agriculture research okay and he did some
interesting research he demonstrated that the soils with the highest nutrients
did not predict the best plant growth another piece of information that i was actually quite
surprised you would think that if the soil has the most minerals it would produce the best crop right
or the healthiest plant that's absolutely not true what he did find which will explain everything
is this the best predictor of plant growth and plant health was the fungal and bacteria
ratio you see as you use the farmland and you use pesticides and insecticides what happens over time
is you lose the fungal growth until your bacterial counts become higher and higher and higher
to the point where you're 100% bacteria and no fungal you see fungus is a very important part of
soil it's part of the microbial flora that helps break down the rocks the sand and the
organic material and then makes the minerals available to the plant it's both the fungus
and bacteria that make minerals soluble for the plant so it can be usable and exchangeable
and without those microorganisms the minerals basically are locked up in the clay in the sand
and the rocks they're unavailable to the plant and you need a ratio of one to one fungus to
bacteria and this is why a lot of farmers have to use mpk the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium
because they can just give the plants you know some quick nutrients to get them to grow
because there's very little microbial growth that is making the rocks available for that plant
now how does this relate to our bodies well we need microorganisms in our gut to assimilate
food we need acid in our stomach to actually help absorb the nutrients from the food
to break down the proteins without the acid we can't absorb minerals we can't break
down protein into amino acids without bile salts we can't extract fat-soluble vitamins
without enzymes we can't break down the food to extract the micronutrients
and without friendly fungus and friendly bacteria we can't actually break down the
food either to extract nutrients into our body and so a big mistake that people make
is they go to the store they buy their one a day vitamin and they're buying basically
the wrong type of vitamins they're buying inorganic elemental minerals for example
things that are like rocks or metals and our body cannot pull those in see our bodies were meant to
consume the plants and the animals that have already converted these minerals into minerals
that we can absorb in our body and so this video is really just about emphasize the importance
of the microorganisms not just in our body but in the soil that actually makes the food that animals
eat to make us healthier so stay tuned for more videos on this very interesting topic hey before
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course
i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on
this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your
immune system that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so
you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune
system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

so how many soft drinks do you think people consume on a yearly basis well
i was actually quite shocked when i saw this in the year 2000 an average american
consumed 53 gallons of soft drinks every single year in fact in 2000 i don't even think i had
one cup of a soft drink so there's a lot of people probably consuming a lot more than 53 gallons and
in 2018 it was 38.97 roughly about 40 gallons of soft drinks every year per person in america
that is crazy too high so if you're consuming 53 gallons that's that's over 5 000 teaspoons
of sugar okay and if you're consuming 39 gallons it's over 3 700 teaspoons of sugar think about how
much sandpaper you have to use on the inside of your arteries on the inside of your eyes this is
going to create so much inflammation for the heart for the kidney for your nervous system
no wonder we have so many pre-diabetics not to mention bone loss in fact all soft drinks are
linked to an increased risk of bone loss but most of the bone loss comes from the combination of
high fructose corn syrup phosphoric acid caffeine and you're going to be deficient in vitamin d
as well as magnesium and most of the bone loss occurs in the hip thus the increased trend of
people getting hip fractures mainly in what's called the wards area which is right at this
point in the hip so anyway this is just another video to increase your awareness on sugar and
the sources of sugar and the massive consumption of sugar which occurs when you drink soda so if

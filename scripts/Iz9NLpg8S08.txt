so today I'm going to give you a very important tip to help figure out health
problems now this is gonna be a fairly short video but it's so simple but it's
so important it's probably one of the most important questions you can ask
yourself or ask someone when figuring out a health problem it's rarely asked
and never emphasized but it's so simple so this is the question what happened
just before you experienced your health condition right there will always be
some trigger it could be food-related could be some stress something going on
in the environment I'm gonna give you some examples had a patient come in with
angina chest pain really bad she's been struggling with this for probably a week
and a half it took me two seconds said when did it
start she goes I don't really remember I says we'll take a look she started
looking and then uh listen oh yeah it was on a Tuesday I said okay what time
she said five o'clock I said okay what did you eat right before that she goes
start looking and she remembered she ate a huge banana split and this is a true
story it's swole up the gallbladder and then
there was pressure on the liver and because the liver is right next to the
heart it put pressure in the heart she went to the emergency room
$40,000 later okay they found nothing and then she end up in my office later
now somehow that event lingered on for a week and a half and I had to lay on the
table did some gentle massage around her abdomen all the pain went away and never
came back so that would be one example another example someone came in they
started losing their teeth I said what happened just before that they're
looking they said nothing and I said well nothing did you change your diet oh
yeah I became a vegan I said aha interesting so they started cutting out
all fats all fat soluble vitamins vitamin D vitamin k2 and apparently that
was connected to the strain the connected tissue around their teeth
and the teeth fell out another person came in with serious liver pain and
gallbladder problems right they went to the doc and said it was inflamed the
doctor didn't give them any practical information they end up in my office and
no one asked them what did you do just before you had these symptoms so I asked
the question and found out they started some new diet
it was Ideal Protein which are these powder foods which are low-carb but very
processed high in soy protein isolates probably genetically modified very low
fat and it's very hard on the liver so it's another example another person came
in with all these rashes in the body says when did it start got her to look
find out what it was and started to put her on a food elimination program where
we started limiting certain things and found out isolated it was a simple food
allergy so you can use this with yourself or your friends it's just so
simple so I have a question for you so if you have a health problem right now
take a look and tell us in the comment section what happened just before you
started to experience that health complaint and let me know all right
thanks for watching

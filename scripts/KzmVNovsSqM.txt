not only can stress make you stronger it is necessary to make you stronger without stress
you weaken now of course you need a balance between stress and recovery and this is really
based on something called a hermetic effect where you're adding a dose of stress and then the body
adapts so the body has this urge to survive so when you stress it it reacts to survive more
and it adapts and becomes stronger let's take a deeper look at what's going on here all right you
have the immune system you have one part immune system which is the innate which you're born
with your mother has given you this immune system based on her stress and adaptation but you also
have what's called the acquired immune system this is something that you develop over time
but in order to develop this part of the immune system you have to expose it to infection you
have to go through various stresses to develop the antibodies to have a stronger immune system
in fact you can't develop a strong immune system without being exposed to pathogens and having
your body react and this is why people that live in a sterile environment or even especially kids
they don't have a strong immune system they're always getting sick and so having a sterile
environment or trying to artificially boost your immune system doesn't always work all right then
we have exercise okay it's a stress that breaks down muscle tissue it actually creates damage
but then the recovery phase through the help of hormones you become stronger versus someone who
is very inactive they actually start shrinking they get atrophy and weaker over time of course
the key with exercise is that recovery if you're not sleeping if you're over training you're not
going to get any better number three fasting this is very interesting because it's counterintuitive
you would think if you starve someone or deprive them of nutrients they would automatically get
weaker but they don't when you deprive microbes of nutrients they actually live longer they
become more diversified your body goes through all sorts of magical things from regrowing brain cells
to regrowing your immune system to healing chronic disease because the inflammation goes down to the
inactivation of cancer cells of course there is a limit to fasting if you starve yourself for too
long you know you will die all right number four phytonutrients these are the chemicals in plants
one of the purposes of a phytonutrient is to act as a pesticide or an insecticide to kill certain
things that are trying to kill it and protect itself and so when you consume some of these
plants you're getting exposed to these chemicals as well and your body can create a hormonic effect
and become stronger and resistant to it just by being exposed to a certain dose of these
pesticides of course the dosage is very very small so it's not going to create the same effect
and usually some of these toxic chemicals and plants are very bitter like the radish
like arugula swiss chard or mustard greens but consuming some of these things in small
amounts can actually give you some benefit all right number five cold therapy cryotherapy
a cold shower or bathing in a tub of cold water can stimulate certain mechanisms to make you
stronger and actually create a healing effect same thing can happen when you go to hot sauna
you can create this effect but of course if we compare these cold which is more uncomfortable
can stimulate a greater improvement than using things like a sauna or a hot shower
number six decrease oxygen this is called hypoxia where you're depriving your body of a little
oxygen to cause your red blood cells to adapt and become stronger and of course this can occur
if you're training in high altitudes on a mountain top and you can even exercise with certain masks
to restrict the air to cause your body to actually adapt radiation a small amount of radiation from
the sun for example can cause this adaptation effect and you actually your body can become
more resistant to it and become stronger all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick
i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i
want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but
what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing
this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist
your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

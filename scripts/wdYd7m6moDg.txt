the pau d'arco tree in south america primarily in peru brazil paraguay and argentina now
i'm normally used to seeing this ingredient in certain products that kill parasites in products
that are antimicrobial but this compound is used for all sorts of interesting symptoms
reducing a fever countering snake bites helping someone lower blood pressure supporting your
intestines and digestive issues helping with your blood sugars and it has a strong
anti-inflammatory effect but what i'm impressed with is some of the other effects that this
natural extract can produce it can act as a natural antibiotic it has natural anti-fungal
properties so it's good for candida thrush which is like a white tongue or candida on your tongue

are resistant to antibiotics like mrsa there's also some interesting results with h pylori it
also has anti-tumor and anti-cancer effects primarily of the estrogen-type cancers it's

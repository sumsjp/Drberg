so if you have hypothyroidism i highly recommend that you take cod liver oil let's talk about why
there are three main key nutrients that the thyroid needs number one it needs iodine and
iodine makes up the thyroid molecule itself in fact when we talk about t4 or t3 we're talking
about the number of iodine molecules okay then you have selenium selenium is involved in an enzyme
that allows the conversion from t4 to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone
so you need selenium it's a trace mineral so about 80 percent of this conversion happens in
the liver and 20% happens in the kidney so you need a healthy liver and you need a healthy kidney but
vitamin a is involved in this other hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone which is
created from the pituitary and it's sent down to the thyroid so it tells the thyroid what to do
and this whole chain of events is on a negative feedback loop in fact the way they diagnose
hypothyroidism is with the thyroid stimulating hormone if the thyroid stimulated hormone goes up
because there's no negative feedback coming back that's one way they would diagnose a hypothyroid
case and when you have a vitamin a deficiency you have a massive increase in thyroid stimulating
hormone and that can even increase the size of the thyroid as in a goiter and actually decrease
the absorption of iodine so vitamin a is very important in thyroid function so we have iodine
selenium and vitamin a now what is the best source of vitamin a you might say carrots or spinach well
that will give you the precursor the beta carotene which is good but the amount of conversion that's
going to happen is very very tiny okay because we want the active form of vitamin a which is retinol
but it is also good for the eyes and the sinus and many other things but the thyroid is another
benefit from vitamin a now you can get a lot of vitamin a from liver in fact you might get too
much if you have too much liver so you'd have to have just a small amount of liver
that's probably one of the best sources of vitamin a if you like liver and you don't overdo it
i'm going to recommend cod liver oil because a regular recommended amount if you're going to get
a supplement would give you about 150 percent of vitamin a which is a little more than what
your body might need not too much just enough and plus cod liver oil will give you vitamin d
it will also give you omega-3 fatty acids you can also find retinol in butter grass-fed butter
eggs fatty fish cheese and other foods as well but i wanted to emphasize the importance of vitamin a
for the thyroid all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

let's talk about how to cure hiccups
almost instantly now what is the hiccup
well the diaphragm which connects the
upper cavity from the abdominal cavity
right here these two muscles
um goes into spasm and that interrupts
your vocal cords creating a hick sound
okay so that's
what it is
triggers involve laughing excessive
talking
i remember in the past when i prepared
for
a talk right i would practice right
before my live presentation i would be
practicing what i'm going to say right
and sometimes i'd be going really fast
and then i would get the hiccups
and now i have to wait
for a period of time before they go away
because you can't do a presentation with
hiccups i really wish i would have known
what to do back then but i'm going to
show you what to do but if you're eating
too fast you can get these hiccups if
you're stressed you can get these
hiccups and so people tell you that oh
yeah you just need to hold your breath
drink water upside down breathe into a
paper bag or breathe really slowly okay
and your hiccups will go away now the
question is do any of these work but the
bigger question is what's going on what
is causing this problem
you know
a solution depends on really
understanding the problem and medicine
it's all about taking a problem and then
treating it there's this huge gap in
understanding the problem so you can
actually
fix the root cause but it's not about
root causes it's about let's suppress
the symptom and let's keep suppressing
the symptom and let's create this
solution that only lasts for 24 hours so
you have to keep taking the solution
over and over now before i get into
how to fix this i just want to explain
how i approach
figuring out things okay
let's just take for example this symptom
called gerd
which is a condition where your valve on
the top of the stomach is not closing
and you the acid squirts up through into
the esophagus so what i normally do to
figure out something is i will take the
symptom
or the problem and compare it to normal
physiology that happens in this area of
the body so in a normal situation when
you eat the valve on the top of the
stomach should close right
but with gerd it's left open and so the
acid comes back up and then they treat
it with antacids or ppi's or other types
of medication so when i try to figure
this out
i want to know the mechanism i want to
know what's called pathophysiology which
is patho means disease and physiology is
how things actually work so i'll study
normal physiology of the stomach and
pathophysiology of gerd to see if i
could really understand what's going on
and then come up with a solution now
with gerd
i found some very interesting
information that's not broadly promoted
that the valve has
sensors for ph
okay
normally
the ph of the stomach should be
extremely acid between one and three
but with gerd i found some data that the
ph is higher it's more alkaline it's not
as acid and so apparently what's
happening with gerd is that valve is not
sensing that the ph is one to three and
it's not closing like it should when you
eat so that data tells me that what we
need to do with gerd is add more acid to
the stomach and that's what i did in
practice and it worked like a charm
would give people either retain
hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar and
boom gone i mean think about it antacids
and ppis given to people who have
acid reflux or
gerd
or heartburn
have a side effect and one of the side
effects of antacids nppis
is gerd and heartburn and acid reflux so
anyway i just wanted to explain how i
figure these things out because this
relates to hiccups there was a
fascinating research study that i had to
really dig to find this study and it was
done in cats okay this is what they
found this is interesting
hiccups
stopped immediately when the co2 carbon
dioxide pressure
in the veins
equals the co2 pressure in the arteries
okay now to make this very simple
hiccups stop when you increase
co2 okay that is very very
counterintuitive doesn't make sense
unless you understand something
if someone gets too much oxygen in their
blood without enough co2 that oxygen
doesn't bind
or get released like it should and the
person basically starves of oxygen
now how does that relate to hiccups well
guess what what's happening when you're
laughing you're getting a lot of oxygen
excessive talking you're getting a lot
of oxygen eating too fast you're getting
a lot of oxygen when you're stressed a
lot of times you're hyperventilating
getting too much oxygen and this also
explains why holding your breath
increases co2
making those hiccups go away when you're
drinking upside down you're controlling
your breathing okay getting more co2
less oxygen
look what's happening when you're
breathing into a bag you're basically
breathing your carbon dioxide it's the
carbon dioxide that then balances out
this excess amount of oxygen and allows
the oxygen to finally be bound and
released into the bloodstream and into
the muscles like the diaphragm when
people have too little co2 okay
their ph changes
and becomes more alkaline in alkalosis
everything gets really really tight you
get spasms it affects your breathing and
so one symptom of alkalosis is hiccups
and then hiccups caused by too much
oxygen can then
trigger more alkalosis so it's kind of a
vicious circle so hiccups are caused by
too much oxygen and not enough co2 and
the best way to get rid of them very
very fast is to increase co2 by doing
any of these right here in fact if you
have a bag
and breathe into it that would work very
nicely or you can just breathe through
your nose not your mouth by slowing your
breath down
five seconds in and five seconds out you
can even hold your breath any one of
these will work as long as you
understand you don't want to get more
oxygen you want to get less oxygen and
more co2 so if you have that key
understanding which is right here
then you can you can be creative you can
actually
wear a mask right
and uh increase your co2 that way so
anyway the next time you get a hiccup or
someone else around you gets a hiccup
now you know exactly what to do now i've
talked a little bit about this in my
video on panic attacks which i give you
a much greater understanding about this
co2 oxygen thing
i would highly recommend checking out
that video if you haven't seen it i put
it up right here

and a randomized controlled trial involving 60 people they compared the effectiveness
of using curcumin to prozac they found that curcumin is as effective as prozac
without some of the side effects now what are the side effects of prozac
quite a few and this is just a very short list nausea headache insomnia diarrhea
fatigue weakness with rare side effects of chest pain severe dizziness painful erection that can
last for over four hours and there's many many more that i didn't list and by the way check
with your doctor before taking this advice i'm not telling you not to take your prozac
this is just a study to share with your doctor and i'll put the link down below that has some pretty
interesting effects especially if it can work as effective as prozac without the side effects
now how does curcumin work well in one way can increase bdnf what is that brain derived
neurotrophic factor bdnf increases a protein that helps your neurons make new nerve connections and
depression is linked with a decrease in bdnf in fact brain disorders in general are linked to
a decrease in bdnf also if you're low on this factor it can lead to a shrinking hippocampus
which is involved in memory and the capacity to learn something curcumin also has the ability
to increase serotonin as well as dopamine both involved in your overall mood now if you're going
to use curcumin i would highly recommend that you also change your diet and you start doing
fasting which which can have a huge effect on your mood i would also increase vitamin d
add probiotics start exercising and definitely get a low carb diet

you know magnesium is needed in a lot of different functions in the body it's a
cofactor in many different biochemical pathways but its primary purpose is
to act as a calcium antagonist now calcium is very toxic in the body unless it's in normal amounts
and if you are over 50 in female and are told that you need to take calcium as in some supplement
this video is for you but if you're taking 500 milligrams or more of calcium every day
that has a potential to increase your risk of heart attacks as well as your risk for a stroke
why because calcium is very toxic in the body unless it's in normal amounts in fact calcium
is essential we need it desperately but we need it in smaller amounts calcium does not exit the body
very easily we tend to hold on it and there's many different disease processes out there involving
the accumulation of calcium especially building up calcium in your arteries this is why one of
the best tests that you can do for that would be a cac test a coronary artery calcification test
or scan and i personally had that scan i'll put a link down below so you can watch
the video on that but the test is very quick it's relatively inexpensive but it'll give
you some really good data on predicting mortality from heart attacks but it's going to measure the
calcium in the coronary artery and so magnesium is the key mineral to help prevent that now there's
also vitamin k2 that is also involved right there i'm just bringing this up because there
are some people that are taking supplements and they're taking calcium every single day and they
don't realize that it's actually quite harmful i don't ever recommend taking a lot of calcium
the way i know that a lot of people are taking calcium is all you have to do is look at the top
selling multivitamin minerals in the world and just pick up the bottle it's going to be
really heavy like it's almost like a paper weight that's because the first ingredient is calcium
carbonate not a good thing to take because of this right here if you're taking a multivitamin mineral
read the ingredients and make sure it doesn't have the calcium carbonate
and it's really kind of bizarre to me that you would put that as the first ingredient
in a multi-vitamin mineral and that's because anytime you have the first ingredient that makes
up the bulk of that product and calcium carbonate which is limestone is extremely
cheap it's like basically eating rocks and they're selling these rocks with some synthetic vitamins
and you think you're getting something that's quality when you're not and these products are
very very cheap okay so then we have a condition called hypercalcemia too much calcium in the blood
sometimes people ask me what about vitamin d is that going to cause hypercalcemia first of all you
would have to take extreme amounts extremely large amounts of vitamin d like over 100,000 IUs maybe
over 200,000 IUs and take it for months before you would develop that okay so when we're talking
about much smaller levels like 10,000 or 20,000 or even 30,000 IUs of vitamin d3 that's not what
i'm talking about when i'm saying extreme large amounts but if you have hypercalcemia
hear the symptoms arrhythmias abdominal pain paralytic ileus that means your colon has shut
down it's obstructed but there's nothing physical that's blocking your colon that's because the
calcium is interfering with the other electrolytes that help you in the contraction of the smooth
muscle in your in your colon okay vomiting is a symptom excessive urination or reduced urination
interesting psychosis strong desire for sleep and constipation now you can get magnesium
from consuming a lot of salads like leafy greens pumpkin seeds have a good amount
of magnesium avocado is a good source and nuts are a good source as well if you want
more information about that cac test i put a link down before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

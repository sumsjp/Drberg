hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about how to get rid of
puffy eyes and those bags and underneath the eyes okay now I'm just gonna let you
know the cucumber slices don't really work long-term or creams and everything
this is all an internal problem it's mainly a kidney problem now I can see
people across the street and look at their eyes and they're all puffy and I'm
like oh that's a kidney issue now anytime you have a kidney issue you're
gonna have a liver issue so they're almost similar in problems you can't
have a really sick kidney and a healthy liver okay because they both work
together but the kidney is a detoxifier it basically takes all your blood it's a
filter it's like an oil filter and it filters the blood so here's what happens
with a kidney number one you can be consuming
excess cooked protein too much protein so let's say you're sitting down for
dinner and you're just loading up this huge huge plate of chicken wings or
chicken fingers and you have absolutely no vegetables nothing to counter that
you're getting a lot of protein that's going to eventually turn into uric acid
crystals and a lot of excessive waste because your body can't process more
than a certain amount of protein so anything extra your it strains the
kidneys and the liver okay so a protein can mess it up in large amounts how much
protein do you need three to six ounces that's just a little bit
you don't need tremendous amounts so excessive protein and too little
vegetable people that have the bags have the kidney problems usually don't ever
eat vegetables okay they don't you need to start doing that if you have this
problem because this also relates to the potassium levels in the body you have so
much potassium and so much sodium they work together and fluid retention
usually as a sodium excess well if you just have your normal potassium amounts
that alone will flush out the sodium and get rid of the fluid so we need four
times as much potassium to sodium so a lot of people have it reversed they're
doing four times as much sodium to potassium
and they're just like fluid water lock and you can see it in the ankles there's
pitting edema but this situation it's really the
vegetable has the most of the potassium and then you're not going to get a lot
of potassium from proteins so then we have alcohol right so alcohol messes
with your kidney it messes with your liver it crates the
bags a lot of people think that's normal to drink alcohol on a regular basis they
drink a bottle of wine two bottles of wine and you think well that's fine well
here's the question can you give it up if you can't give it up then you're
probably addicted okay so then we have the MSG monosodium glutamate
monosodium glutamate is a flavor enhancer it's in all the Chinese restaurants and
they hide it not as much monosodium glutamate they hide it as modified food
starch and what it's a lot of sodium that's not salty so you're gonna walk
away and just drink fluid and you're just like gonna fill up with fluid
really fast so it's a water retainer and it's a flavor enhancer it also spikes
insulin too and then we have just straight sugar and junk food that's
going to mess with your kidneys so we need 4700 milligrams of potassium that
would be seven to ten cups of vegetables a lot of times people say well I don't
want to have much potassium because I heard that it might damage the kidneys
let me let me just give you the truth in the kidney unless you're on kidney
dialysis unless you're stage like a real bad kidney where you're like end-stage
kidney failure everything else you can do potassium the fact it's shown that
potassium protects the kidney it doesn't worsen the kidney you need potassium to
protect the kidney it's just that when the kidney is so damaged
you can't process potassium and it starts to increase because you're not
getting rid of it so you need so much potassium but your body gets rid of that
much potassium every day - so if the kidneys can't do that you could end up
with a lot of potassium which is dangerous to the heart but again for
those of you there aren't good analysis okay you can't
the potassium but the cool thing is we're not even talking about taking in
the supplement we're just taking getting it from vegetables so you're gonna be
more safe with that then you have another cause of kidney problems which
would be the prostate enlargement what happened is the prostate when it
enlarges it actually pushes up into the bladder okay it pushed up in the bladder
and it restricts the amount of urine the bladder can hold and then the urine
backs up through these two little pipes are called
the ureter s'okay and they go right to the kidney and then what happens the
kidneys can't filter the urine so it backs up and the kidneys start getting
larger and larger so that's really what would mess up the
kidney - is having a prostate enlargement I had one guy and all we did
is some simple acupressure you can actually work on these points with a
massage tool you can work on them and it's interesting what will happen you'll
have it probably really tight and painful and congested you do it lightly
and you keep working it out I've had so many people do that and all of a sudden
just dump all this excess fluids from their bodies it's quite dramatic so
that's just a side point so we got the kidney and then number two we have blood
sugars so usually when someone's hypoglycemic insulin resistance or a
diabetic they usually a puffiness underneath the eyes just because
wherever the sugar goes that the water goes so they have a lot of water
retention in pockets and the ankles and the hands in the eyes I mean underneath
the eyes so what you want to do with if you have blood sugar issues you want to
do 3 to 6 ounces of protein with each meal don't don't do a lot but don't cut
it out completely because you need some 7 cups of vegetables that's not hard to
do right you probably need more but that's a good start that will increase
and help the blood sugars and help insulin regulate itself and then we need
a little healthy fat to allow you to go from one meal to the next so we're not
snacking so that's just I'll put some links down below if this is your first
video and you've never seen the data on how to and correct blood Sugar's but
that would be one cause this far as the kidneys the kidneys do well
on a lot of vegetables a little bit of protein and just so happens one of the
things that are good for the kidney is the kidney bean what a coincidence it's
shaped like a kidney all right so apply this information all right guys so thank
you so much for watching I'll see you in the next video

hi guys in this video I want to share with you some effects of chronic stress on your
brain okay that's high levels of cortisol over a period of time sustained stress can raise cortisol
to the point where it starts to destroy certain parts of the brain specifically the hippocampus
the hippocampus comes from the word seahorse because it looks like a little seahorse and
there's actually two of them on the side of the brain and they have a role in two things one is
short-term memory and a role in locating yourself and time and space so it's like your GPS like when
a bird flies south for the winter how do they know where to go well the hippocampus so there's
this pre-program kind of a grid in your brain that you can help locate things so if this is
damaged then you're going to have a hard time with driving directions you're going to be a
hard time locating where you parked okay so you're going to not remember where you are all the time
so that's that's the early sign of Alzheimer's or the later stages of Alzheimer's you just you
lost your GPS in your brain okay and the problem is we're becoming so dependent on artificial GPS
is that we'd never really use maps anymore so that is also a problem so increased cortisol
from stress will shut off the oxygen to this part of the brain and start causing problems with that
area but also high levels of insulin will also destroy the hippocampus so again sugar okay so
sugar and stress but there's one more thing and it's actually vitamin b1 deficiency so there's a
vitamin b1 deficiency it causes atrophy of this specific structure interesting it looks like a
classic symptom if you're really deficient you start having these symptoms so it could be that
it's stress depleting the b1 or the sugar to pleadin b1 but if I were if I had this
condition I would start loading up on vitamin b1 and a natural form to start to reverse this
process but just make mental note if you have a friend or family member or a grandparent whatever
that's experiencing this star giving them some natural be one from nutritional yeast and I bet
you they'll see some great improvements thanks for watching press it forget it forget it I'm done

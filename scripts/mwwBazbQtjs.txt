in this video we're going to talk about how much fat you need to be consuming on keto so
this is a very important video so you might want to watch this several times just so you can really
break it down and digest it no pun intended all right so i want to talk about several
concepts here rather than giving you like a cookbook of telling you how many grams whatever
i want to give you the concepts now take a look at this pie chart here now notice that
the healthy keto plan that i recommend is about 20 protein 70 fat 5 low glycemic carbohydrates
and 5 veggies and the reason i didn't want to mix that in with the carbs is because i don't
even want to count that i encourage people to have a lot of leafy greens and vegetables just
to get your minerals and certain vitamins so i i put that as an extra little chart so this is 10
plus 20 plus 70 equals 100 and we're talking about calories now normally when you consume protein in
its whole form and i'm giving a generality it's not exactly this but if you consume beef fish
egg i'm talking about like salmon or egg the ratio of fat to protein is roughly one to one
okay now i'm talking about in weight in grams not calories in calories
it's usually two to one fat being a little more than double the calories to protein why because
of this protein has four calories per gram and fat has 9 calories per gram so this is more than twice
protein if you're trying to lose weight one way to do it is to drop your fat i want to clarify
what i meant by that i never meant to say go lean protein okay so i would never recommend that what
i'm talking about is get rid of the extra fats restrict the extra fats like the mct oil the
butter that you put in your coffee in the morning bulletproof coffee or the keto bomb desserts
that contain extra fat but when you're consuming protein with the ketogenic diet you always want to
keep the fat that normally comes with that protein together also the leaner you are with the protein
the higher the insulin response that's why whey protein which virtually has no fat is very high
on the insulin index it triggers insulin and so you want to stick with proteins that have higher
amounts of fat now roughly how much fat should you be consuming on a ketogenic diet it's very
difficult to say simply because you have a lot of variables you have the age of the person and you
have the physical activity you have the metabolism and you also have health issues for example
if the person has gut issues i'm talking about celiac or irritable bowel syndrome
or crohn's disease or even an autoimmune condition they need to make sure that their ratio is
definitely two to one twice as much fat as protein but in weight in grams not calories
so i want to make an important distinction people with gut issues have a lot of inflammation and the
more gut issues someone has the more they should only stick with animal protein and fat as in the
carnivore at least for a while for some months to heal the gut if you don't have a gut issue
i still recommend you do your fats to protein two to one but in calories okay but it's not
easy but you can do it but to be successful if you have gut issues you want to increase
more animal fat so you get this ratio two to one in weight or grams okay not the calories
the calorie two to one ratio is if you don't have gut issues and that's actually pretty easy because
normally the beef fish and egg come at this ratio right here with a two to one ratio in
calories and a one-to-one ratio in weight so i want to pause here if you are confused back up
re-watch this because i went through things a bit fast and the reason for some of these complexities
is that you have some different variables you're trying to deal with and some people
want to lose weight some people want to gain more weight some people want to maintain the weight
and some people have gut issues and if you have a gut issue you definitely want to do carnivore
for a while but not just lean protein you want to do fattier protein and if there's gut issues
in addition to this fat to protein ratio you want to avoid certain things you want to avoid
the fats from nuts and coconuts and the fat from seed like in seed oils you want to avoid
dairy and sometimes even avoid egg and butter unless it's clarified as ghee and avoid avocado
and mct oil since this comes from coconuts and i'm sorry it's so restrictive but for some people if
they go on a regular ketogenic diet and they're doing the nuts and the seeds and the dairy it's
going to tear them up so even though the keto friendly diet for a gut issue is a bit restrictive
it can give a person tremendous relief if they do it correctly and there's a few tips i want to give
you for someone who needs to increase more animal fats with their protein and keep it at this two to
one ratio and i'm talking about weight sausage has higher amounts of fat from the farmer's market you
can do pate which is a an organ meat type product that will give you a higher fat to protein ratio
you can make your own stews to include more fat in there because if you're making a hamburger or
baking you're basically frying off all the fat and getting rid of the fat with the stew you can keep
it all together and of course eggs have a good amount of fat but even this is a one-to-one ratio
and so i don't recommend doing carnivore just with steak i recommend adding more
of these other things right here now if you don't have a gut issue
you can do these right here these fats right here and you can consume beef fish
and eggs normally like they are and that will give you a two to one ratio in calories
now the last question is are you going to be counting your calories or grams with fat
that's going to be very very labor intensive i'm just going to give you one little rule of thumb i
would mainly focus on not consuming protein that's lean but protein that normally comes with the fat
i would consume fattier protein and if we look at the weight of that protein before it's cooked
and you were to look at a whole day of consuming protein it should be between 400 grams to
600 grams of that protein and that way you don't have to count the fat because the fat comes with
a protein now there's one more confusion i want to mention and clarify when we're talking about 400
grams to 600 grams of protein i have to make a distinction because if you're taking let's
say a hamburger patty right a hamburger patty has various things in there you have collagen
you have no carbs there's protein there's actually a good amount of water in there so you can break
it down by weight so much water so much collagen so much protein i'm not talking about the actual
protein grams in the steak i'm talking about the actual weight of the entire protein itself should
be between 400 grams to 600 grams so if you're weighing protein foods like fish egg or beef
this is ideally per day if you target between 400 600 grams 600 would be someone that's more active
a larger person and 400 would be a smaller person and in the description down below
i gave you more examples all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

hey guys Dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about something
called GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease right so it's a long word really
means it's really similar to acid reflux or heartburn where the acid kind of
comes up and it's really a problem with the valve between the esophagus and the
stomach and the reason why people have this problem is because their pH in
their stomach goes to alkaline now this is the opposite of what you've been told
but it's true and I can prove it so normally in your stomach you need a pH
of 1 to 3 that is extremely acid okay so as you go higher things become more
alkaline until you get to 7 which is neutral and it keeps going higher so
anything that goes higher is alkaline anything that goes lower on the scale is
acid okay so when the pH is 1 2 3 everything is cool you can digest this
valve closes very nicely at 1 2 3 so it keeps the acid contained but when this
pH in the stomach starts rising and going more alkaline like what happens
with a lot of people that get older especially in their 40s and 50s and 60s
and 70s you start losing your stomach acid and it's no coincidence that a lot
of older people have GERD or acid reflux it's because the age you lose your
stomach acids so what happens when you lose that the valve doesn't close
anymore so what do people take anti acids it's the exact thing that will
make them feel better temporarily but the next time I eat it keeps going and
keeps going in and get worse even if you look up the side effects of the
medication for GERD it will it will it actually causes more heartburn as one of
the side effects or even an ulcer or even calcium soft tissue that builds up
because you need the stomach acid very very acidic to be able to absorb
minerals and digest protein so if you're eating food
without a good strong acid stomach you get gas indigestion
you have bloating you actually have problems absorbing minerals you become
anemic the need the taste for meat goes down you just can't digest especially
red meat so the point is that if you want to get relief with this condition
I'm going to recommend you try two things you try betaine hydrochloride
which is an acidifier it's a natural thing you can get and you would take
maybe I don't know three four with a meal and or apple cider vinegar pills or
apple cider vinegar they have them in little pills and you can take these with
eating right before you eat so you might take two of these and two of these boom
start feeling better and you're like wow why don't I feel better because you're
making this more acid and this is closing so it stops the acid from
regurgitating back up into your esophagus very simple solution now the
other thing I want to mention is that something called h-pylori h-pylori is a
microbe that invades the whole system when your ph goes alkalyn if you keep
your acid your stomach acid you have more protection against h-pylori many
people have h-pylori in their body but it's inactive it becomes activated when
your ph goes higher and more alkaline interesting so there's a one of the
purposes of having a strong acid in your stomach is to kill microbes from that
are in the food that you eat so we need this acidifier - just like a dog can eat
raw meat or you know they eat something I don't on the ground and their
stomach is so acid they can just dissolve any microbes okay so we want
this food to be digested fully at the stomach level to prevent GERD and
basically keep the valve shut and nicely you know so you can actually digest so
basically apply this and write write your comments below and hopefully you'll
feel much better

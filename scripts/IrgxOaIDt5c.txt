let's talk about how to sleep off your belly fat now wouldn't it be nice to be able to go
to sleep and wake up and you have a flat stomach well i think a lot of people don't emphasize the
importance of sleep in helping you lose weight so if you've been watching my videos you know the
standard routine of what you need to do to lose weight lower those carbs do intermittent fasting
add exercise lower stress but i want to emphasize sleep because i had someone recently
who was doing everything right but they were plateaued but all i told them to do was improve
their sleep and bam they started losing weight finally after months of trying to lose weight
and no success there's an interesting study i'll put it down below that demonstrated
that when you get less than five hours of sleep you significantly increase the risk of obesity
specifically visceral fat around your midsection so let's go through some key points when you sleep
you burn the most fat you don't burn a lot of fat during the day it's when you're sleeping
and so if you're not getting enough sleep and of course quality sleep that's going to be a huge
factor so you need at least seven hours eight would be optimum right here some people
actually need more but there's some people they get like nine or ten hours but the quality is
terrible so that's a big factor too so i'm talking about high quality sufficient sleep and by the way
i get a lot of feedback when someone gets a really good night rest their mood is incredible their
stress goes way down so sleeping reduces stress specifically cortisol number three sleep improves
your blood sugar levels it will actually help you get rid of insulin resistance because it helps
stabilize your blood sugars with a lack of sleep you're going to gain weight you're going to have
more symptoms with metabolic syndrome and your appetite will go up so here's some tips number one
add some plants in your room where you sleep it'll give you more oxygen i would also highly recommend
keeping your window open when you sleep unless it's the middle of winter but other than that
opening the window will help you sleep as well if you're not on a low carb diet you should get
on a low carb diet and just notice the difference in quality of sleep first of all you're not going
to get up several times a night to urinate secondly you're going to notice that you're
going to breathe better through your sinuses third you're going to notice that when you switch over
to low carb you're going to go into a much deeper rejuvenating sleep now a couple things that are
really important right before bed calcium is really important potassium magnesium is really
important as a supplement these electrolytes help calm down the nervous system and relax the muscles
vitamin b1 is great if you have excessive thinking 24 7 and stress vitamin b1 will help you
drift off into a wonderful relaxing sleep celery is a really good thing to consume as your last
meal of the day your dinner because there's certain phytonutrients in celery that actually
promote sleeping and lower blood pressure decreasing emf electromagnetic frequency
i'm talking about in your room if you have a lamp or you have some type of electrical device unplug
them because even though the light's off you still have voltage or current going on in the wire
and there's electrical fields that extend from those wires about six feet and so you're going
to be bathing in this magnetic field which is going to interfere with your ability to sleep
so with myself i cleaned all that up and that made a huge difference in my sleep and i have a little
test or an emf tester i'll put a link down below if you want more information how to test yourself
but you want to test different parts of your house where you spend most the time if it's
behind a computer or you spend one third of your time in bed it'd be a very good idea to make sure
that your emf levels are on the low side exercise will promote better sleep going for the long walk
every single day i do that routinely also go to bed when you're tired if you are tired around 9
30 like myself just go to bed because if you don't you push through it all of a sudden you're awake
and now you're gonna have to wait until you catch the next wave there's 90 minutes sleep cycles so
if you don't go to bed when you're tired and all of a sudden now you're awake it's going to
be difficult to go to sleep and so that's going to disrupt your sleep cycles but i personally get
the best sleep if i go to bed early and sleep my seven hours and then wake up and i'm good to go
stop watching the news before bed if you want to watch the news watch in the morning but right
before bed that might keep you up all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth

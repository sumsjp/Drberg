all right so ginger for everything connected with your stomach so let's say you have stomach pain
bloating acid reflux gas an upset stomach or you feel nauseous ginger hands down is
probably one of the best remedies for any potential issue with your stomach it's safe
it's been proven for thousands of years and it has no side effects there's several ways to get
ginger into your body number one you can shave it into a salad or a food you can get ginger tea i
recommend lemon ginger tea that's a real real good one for this or you can get it as a supplement
now the reason that it works is that ginger stimulates the liver to release more bile
but it doesn't increase the release of bile from the gallbladder it just generates more bile coming
down from the liver into the gallbladder now what is the significance of that so when you get more
bile into the gallbladder it concentrates more and the magic is in the concentration of bile because
if your bile is too weak it's not going to create the effect of extracting fat soluble nutrients
acting as a lubricant through the small intestine preventing bloating and feeling nauseous and if
you're deficient in bile because it's not flowing properly you can eventually develop sludge in
the bile ducts and that can back up and create any one of these symptoms i just talked about
now a couple other good remedies to take would be betaine hydrochloride because the chloride
will give you more hydrochloric acid apple cider vinegar you can get in a pill form or just put
it in your water and drink it peppermint is a good herb anise and fennel are all excellent for
increasing the flow of bile from your liver into your gallbladder to reduce these symptoms

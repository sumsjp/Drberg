we're going to talk about chronic pain in msg monosodium glutamate is there a connection yes
there is a connection now what is an msg that's so bad well glutamate is a naturally occurring
amino acid in soy sauce parmesan cheese and it's also in our brains as a major neurotransmitter now
the problem is it also has another effect of being an excitotoxin which means it has the potential to
damage your nerve cells and cause chronic pain but not just chronic pain headaches migraines chronic
fatigue sleep issues and in one study it was actually quite interesting because the group that
removed msg from their diet and drank more water showed a similar effect to that group that took
acetaminophen which is the painkiller drug so by staying off msg and drinking more water you can
create similar effects to taking a painkiller which is actually interesting so just goes to
show you the effect of msg on your nervous system because it actually damages your nerves now what i
want to increase your awareness on is the other hidden forms of msg okay or other names for msg
we have modified food starch that's one hydrolyzed protein protein isolate extract we have autolyzed
yeast extract these are all different forms of msg and just as a side note msg does increase your
insulin and it's one of the compounds they use to fatten mice in these obesity experiments using
mice so where are you going to find this msg this wonderful flavor enhancer you're going to find it
in chinese food you're going to find in kfc you're going to find it in chick-fil-a and by the way
i used to live on chick-fil-a does chicken sandwiches oh my gosh did i love those
it's in doritos which i used to live on and i would consume the mega bulk uh big bags of
doritos and i would down that in one sitting so i was exposed to a tremendous amount of msg
it's also in pringles which i used to love and eat a lot of and it's also in bouillon cubes and
it's very difficult to find bouillon cubes that don't have msg but i did find one and i will put
that link down below it's in canned soup it's in the frozen processed foods like the pizzas
so you need to start reading the labels and realize just because it's not in the form
of model sodium glutamate doesn't mean that you're not being exposed to msg so if you're

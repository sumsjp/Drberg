in this video i'm going to talk about something called ascites ascites is a condition where
someone's belly is protruded it's usually not fat it's mostly fluid the latin word for ascites
is bag like because it looks like this bag that's hanging from your abdomen now the appearance is
usually protruded like a basketball it's usually not sagging too much it's kind of sticking out
and if you tap on one side you'll see kind of a ripple on the other side
and this is because it's filled with fluid because the liver is leaking certain fluid
into a sac around the abdominal organs the most common cause of ascites is cirrhosis
this is a condition where the liver has so much scar tissue it's overwhelming the liver function
and now the liver can't do its thing and so it's leaking fluid into the gut now there's
other causes to cirrhosis as well you can have cancer pancreatitis heart disease or even tb
but most people with this condition um have cirrhosis now in past videos i talked about
the guy on the beach with the speedo with this protruded belly he's actually skinny everywhere
but his belly is protruding that kind of gives you a visual of what i'm talking about now there's
other associated symptoms that come with this we have portal hypertension which you have high
blood pressure in the venous part of your body edema in the lower legs so let's say you press
into your lower leg and it leaves an indentation okay it's called pitting edema you may have spider
veins around your abdomen or you might have a lot of bruising in the lower legs you might have
gynecomastia which is breast tissue in men that's not normal you may even vomit blood as one of the
side effects now another common symptom involves your brain where you have too much ammonia
building up and that can create a lot of confusion and cognitive dysfunction and several remedies
for that would be number one taking lactolose sauerkraut can help reduce ammonia from the body
and consuming more vegetables would be a good thing making sure you don't consume excessive
amounts of protein have a lesser amount and taking l-glutamine can help now what's interesting when i
was in practice i had medical doctors come in as patients and i always ask them what is the
typical treatment for societies medically and they would say a drainage so they would drain the fluid
they would put the patient on a low salt diet they would give them a diuretic and many times
they would have to be on the liver transplant list because other than these typical treatments there
was no other treatment and i would always say like why wouldn't you support the liver
with maybe something natural but they're just not trained in these natural remedies so if
i had ascites this is what i would do i would immediately start intermittent fasting because
fasting can help reduce liver enzymes it can help improve liver function it can help
decrease the growth of fibrous tissue and scar tissue lessening the intensity of cirrhosis
i would also get on something called milk thistle which can be very hepatoprotective
which means it protects the cells of the liver it can also reduce inflammation as
well i would also get on vitamin e which is the most powerful antioxidant when it comes down to
reducing oxidation free radical damage of various tissues as well as being anti-fibrotic
so it slows down inflammation and slows down the process of the liver developing fibrous tissue
and scar tissue the type of vitamin e that you take is very important i would only recommend
taking tocotrinols not the tocopherols it's going to be 50 times more potent the next thing i would
take would be selenium selenium is one of the best antioxidants for the liver and i would definitely
also go low carb because high carb creates more oxidation more scar tissue all right thanks for
watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

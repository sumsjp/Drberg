so this morning i released a video had the most views i've ever had is 25 000 views an hour
and take take a while to guess what the topic is corona virus yeah it's a very hot topic right now
you know about i would say 15 years ago i was doing talks around the governmental agencies
in washington d.c and also exxon mobil and they kicked me out they actually said you can't talk
anymore i called them up and said why they said well because you're recommending 45 eggs a day
and that's very bad for the heart i said no i didn't say 45 i said 4-5
they said oh okay you can come back so sometimes you have to clarify things
so uh disclosures no financial ties to pharmaceutical diagnostic or medical devices
or food industry owner of dr bird.com dr berg supplements authored the healthy keto plan i
organized a summit called the healthy keto summit every year and my bias is low carb
so today i want to talk about some unique problems that happen in the keto uh world i have a large uh
following on social media i have a facebook close private group of 300 thousand people and i'm it's
called my keto lab i'm able to test different things to see what works see what problems that
people are running into and uh gain a tremendous amount of understanding about what people are
running into and what the solutions are so i want to share today some common problems and
solutions one of the biggest ones being plateau it's keto stall so i want to talk about that first
so a couple couple things one is that you have people who say well it's not working
i only lost two pounds the first week i lost six and now i just lost two pounds
i'm like well you have to understand that is normal so it takes a little bit of education
at first to set people up but there's there's different levels of awareness that you have to
understand you have awareness of the problem awareness of the cause of the
problem awareness of the solution and also of the correct solution so
like i would take like men for example they might have this huge belly but they're not very aware
that that is a fatty liver they're they're just like oh yeah it's fine i can deal with it
so i wouldn't necessarily go right into teaching them about what to eat
because that's too high level so i really address people where they're at and then build them up
and one of the things i found is that you have to teach them the basics of certain things
uh especially like one guy came in he goes um yeah your program's not working i tried it for two
weeks and it didn't work well it did work but then it stopped working well what did you do well i
stopped stop the diet i said did you think it was going to keep working if you stop so you really
have to educate people from the very beginning and so there's a really important very vital principle
that i talk about and that is about it's not lose weight to get healthy it's get healthy to lose the
weight and this is so basic because looking at diabetes as a disease doesn't work as this being
this is like this cause of cause situation it's the effect of course of high insulin
if someone does not understand this concept they're very susceptible to doing the wrong
solution very unhealthy programs diet appetite suppressants low quality
products they try to get they try to actually diet to lose weight how many of you agree that
dieting actually destroys your metabolism you take someone who's menopause and you ask them
how many diets have you been on it's probably been 10 or 12 and every time they do it
of course they're doing it wrong it slows down the metabolism so just because someone's losing
weight doesn't mean they're getting healthy it really depends on how they're losing weight
so there's some products that people think are healthy you have you know of course the
slim fast hidden sugars if you take a look at the ingredients high levels of soy protein isolates
which are exposed to hexane which in pubmed is a neurotoxin and there's no fda has no sealing of
how much hexane is in there had a lot of clients come in that have done like programs like ideal
protein that really high in soy protein isolates and end up with liver and gallbladder issues so
and they're hidden sugars as well so is a really important question that i always always
ask people to figure things out and i think it's just it's not emphasized and that is okay
when did this problem start and what happened just before that and you can get so much data
i had one lady came in with a heart attack a heart attack symptoms she's been to the
hospital spent forty thousand dollars worth of testing and nothing showed up and then we
find out i said when did you start well two weeks ago what day tuesday what did you eat
she was oh a big banana split i said okay laid it on my table started doing some work on her
and it was basically just a congested gallbladder backed up in the liver causing heart pain all
the all the heart symptoms went away so it's really really important to find out
what occurred just before you started having that problem i asked that question a lot
maltodextrin glycemic index way higher than glucose and sugar so obesity is a symptom
it's not if you focus on obesity you're going to basically you're not going to be as successful
it's coming from too much insulin so i have people focus on other indicators of health i
try to get them off the weight loss at first because they may not lose weight initially
especially if they have a slow metabolism so i always ask them how is your energy is
your hunger going away that's a good indication that the insulin is coming back in a good range
carb cravings if you still have carb cravings there's still there's a problem with your blood
sugars is your belly shrinking um there are people women that are actually menopausal that have a lot
of atrophy and it looks just like fat identical because what happens after menopause is sometimes
you have a spike in cortisol cortisol tends to turn muscle protein into glucose and then it
raises insulin so you have this loss of muscle looks like cellulite and fat and they're really
adamantly want to lose weight but this takes some time to heal this process so in the process
they're building up their proteins you know it takes months and months maybe even a year or two
to build up this protein back there where actually they're per volume the muscle is heavier than the
fat so everything is shrinking they're not losing weight you just have to teach them that this is
normal they have to know that so they're not setting themselves up for a loss so the most
important thing that a person could do to increase their health is to use their own fat as fuel
so there's several advantages of doing this number one now you start running on ketones and there's a
lot of advantage it's a superior fuel more energy output appetite suppressant more efficient better
lipid profiles tumors can't consume ketones reduce oxidative stress and more o2 less co2
and then you have the benefits of reduction of insulin which is the common denominator
of so many health problems i mean inflammatory conditions heart of course diabetes the fatty
liver high cholesterol aneurysms stroke dementia other than that it doesn't have
any effects but it's actually pretty connected to everything so you get to do these two things
there's a you know about the glycemic index there's actually an insulin index
too how many of you have not familiar with the insulin index okay those are that's a scale
that um it's all the non-carbohydrate triggers or the non-carbohydrate influences on insulin
and of course fat is the lowest effect on insulin but lean low low-fat protein
like whey protein is very high on the scale of the insulin index and this is why
the keto works really good because you have higher fat higher fat if you have a whole egg for example
versus the egg whites you have a much less insulin spike and this is important just understanding um
what we're trying to do we're trying to create as much health benefit by the reduction of insulin
and so you have the lowering of carb we don't want to be afraid of fat and we need to understand that
scale but we also want to look at other ways of decreasing insulin and one of the biggest ways is
fasting intermittent fasting um fasting is not low carb it's no carb and uh
what happens there's a little hormone called the gip hormone in the small intestine that gets
activated every time you eat no matter what you eat so if you don't understand that you may not
put emphasis on fasting and realize that that's really important especially in the
helping people with really resistant weight problems and that's very beneficial so the
combination of both of these are vitally important insulin is a dominating hormone in the presence of
too much insulin a lot of the other hormones are suppressed especially growth hormone
insulin-like growth factor
and then you get uh when you consult people you get this thing where um
uh you find out they're on sorta keto uh how many of you ever had clients that are in sort of keto
yeah i'm not losing weight well what are you doing well on sort of keto well keto is like
you can't be in sorta keto i mean it just doesn't work it's like a switch there's
gonna be a point where you're you're not gonna get into ketosis there's a certain amount of
carbohydrates that you need to go below and if your metabolism is low it has to be even lower
so i know this might be hard to believe but some of your your patients or clients
do cheat occasionally and they don't tell you that they cheat
they keep it a little secret how many have ever had that happen once once before so
what happens is they keep a little secret and they do it again and again you're coaching
them and you go they're not getting results what's interesting about this is they tend to be a bit um
critical to kind of justify it and so i have learned in practice i have an advantage of being
a practice for 29 years i work with so many people that um i see this common scenario that happens
if a client comes in that's not progressing and they're critical
like they'll say well you know i really don't like the color of your walls and
and your secretary is just so rude and i'm not losing weight and i go thank you very much i have
a question is there anything that you're eating that you shouldn't be eating i look them right
in the eye and they'll look they'll do this like no they look down you know right there
they're not telling the truth so i don't make them feel guilty says well what do you think about when
they ask you that question they go well i did have a little ice cream but it was organic you know
i said okay good anything else uh potato chips but i didn't have that many i got okay how many
do you have well i did have a bag okay and i just keep going anything else and you will be
shocked to find out these guys are consuming massive amounts of junk food on the side
found out this one lady she's doing literally i think a whole bag of oreo cookies every single day
so it's very important if you're coaching someone to know that because if you don't know that you're
going to be uh trying something else and they're going to eventually leave and you're going to
be chop living so it's i spend a lot of time just keeping that communication line open so there's no
secrets i don't care if they cheat just tell me i want that communication line open
so for those people that have a very slow metabolism and i know you have some clients
that no matter what you do they just can't nothing works okay let's put you in a 500 calorie diet
still doesn't work have you exercised more it doesn't work strict keto it doesn't work you
ever have a client like that yeah they're usually menopausal they usually have the thyroid removed
the gallbladder removed they're pre-diabetic and they have a history of many different diets
and now they end up in your office and you're like okay what do i got to do with this
so what i will do is i'll i'll do all the things i told you then i'll start to go down the list and
start to really beef up no pun intended the intermittent fasting so i will decrease the
frequency of eating and i'll have them fast longer there's a really important
rule that i tell my clients and also even the videos right now is that don't eat if you're not
hungry do not eat if you're not hungry because then you're going to be hungry when you eat
because it stimulates insulin so then the blood sugar comes down so it's so simple and so these
individuals what happens is they're they're going a long period of time and i told them they have
two meals a day i said are you hungry now i just eat them because you told me i said okay
let's go to one meal a day all right and i'll do that are they progressing sometimes they're not
they're not really um seeing the um the changes that they really need and they have maybe a huge
belly and you just have to come up with something that's a little more powerful so i will um i'll
do this kind of a stair step method the first thing is i'll take their uh their um breakfast
and i'll say listen if you're in the morning if you're not hungry just don't skip it and
start pushing it forward to lunch and so pretty pretty much there the lunch the breakfast is gone
and so they have lunch and dinner and then what i'll do is i'll take the lunch and the dinner and
i'll start squeezing them together and until the point where it's like a four-hour window
most people do very very well with this and i do have quite a few people doing this on my lab with
tremendous amounts of success some people need to do one meal a day the key is making sure they
have enough nutrients in that meal you know to prevent things like hair loss which i will cover
now some some people need to go even a little bit longer not everyone but i have put people
that fast to the point where they're eating once every other day now as long as your energy is good
they're taking the nutrients and you'll see that they'll finally start to change and i have had
a handful of people who were consuming one meal every other day make sure they do the sea salts
and electrolytes and they finally after all this time start losing weight so their metabolism is
so efficient that this is what they need and it's not that they're starving when they're not eating
they're just they're basically eating their own fat when they're not eating and that's the concept
that you have to get across is that you are eating when you're not eating you're just eating your fat
so sleeping interesting had a lady who um she lifted three and a half million pounds at the gym
over course of a year and lost one single pound and she came in very depressed and i found out
she was not sleeping she was actually on the right she was eating pretty good but she was
she wasn't sleeping so um i i actually worked with with sleeping i actually told her to stop watching
the news right before bed that was the big problem um i told her to start taking calcium magnesium
i did some work on her and she started sleeping like a baby and that was the only time that things
started to kick in she lost a lot of weight great before and after i mean don't underwrite sleep
like my wife and i went on a trip uh recently because we were like completely pale and white in
january so we went to the bahamas to this little remote little island where they have like no
internet no reception and it got dark around 6:30. there was nothing to do so we went to bed at 7 00
and i said well let's just go to bed we go to bed i s we think we slept for 13 or 14 hours
i've never felt that better in my life it was amazing so i mean i've been running on
maybe six hours if that just getting more sleep can create huge changes
in your in your blood sugars in your body so i need to do more of that
okay stress yes that can affect you i think out of all the stress people have a lot of the stress
comes from other people how many realize that people can stress people out certain personality
types you got the slow drivers that just really jack up my adrenals they're just driving and then
you have the antagonistic people but really the the worst case is the is the passive aggressive
the underminers they're the person they told you they stood up for you but they actually ruin
your reputation they'll say comments like well you've done quite well for your educational level
what had this attorney come in to see me he said i said hey how did you find out
about me he says well out of all the quacks you seem to be the less weird
it was kind of a hint of a compliment but it's really kind of just taking my wind out so as
a as a practitioner you're always going to get a percentage of those people that come in that
are just you don't feel good when they're around them i screen those out right now i screen those
guys out and they constantly are nullifying your results if they get results there will
be someone else that worked on them wasn't you or they'll say comments like hey that's
a nice sweater was that on sale like oh you got a haircut was that cheap cuts and like
so it's just something about them you don't really like but i do have a way of i finally figured out
a way of getting back at these people revenge you want to know how i do it you can do but how
many of you have clients like this yeah this is what you do it's it's a great great thing
you when they start doing that all you do is you just look them right in the on the face look them
really close and just say what what's that has that been growing
has that been growing you should probably get that checked out yeah get your liver checked out
because that's what they're doing to you they're introverting you
you just flip it they'll be in the bathroom for hours looking at that little back there
and like oh my gosh is that the coronavirus and then just get them out of your space and
but with this attorney that came in uh what i did is i said um i knew i did not want to
take him on so i said i tell you what this is what i want to do go up to the front
and i have a bottle of calcium it's four dollars i want you to buy that go ahead and try that if
it doesn't work i can't help you never saw him again so nice way of getting rid of those guys
but stress is a really really key thing to oh my gosh exercise either over exercising over training
or not exercising at all so regular consistent exercise um creates some really nice effects with
a lot of things autophagy the cleaning up of old damaged tissue
protects your immune system keeps your body full of oxygen but i had one lady who came in she was
uh exercising i'm not kidding six hours a day and no weight loss six hours a day at the gym
so she was over training so i had her which took a long time to do this but i got her to exercise um
like for an hour twice a week and she started to lose the weight and it was really a weird
brain strain because she didn't realize that overture i mean the benefit of exercise occurs
when you're sleeping the 48 hours later not during the exercise exercise is a stress the benefits are
delayed she didn't understand that um okay bloating so you you i do recommend vegetables
for most people but if they start bloating i take them off of it because they might have sibo small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth they might not deal with them and so there's been a handful of
people not the majority that would just can't do well on vegetables so i will adjust what i do but
i do i'll tell you why i recommend more vegetables in a bit but if they're bloating that can cut down
on the weight loss because they're they're fluid retained they're just holding the stress in the
gut and that's happened a handful of times so you want to you know just kind of look at that as well
okay next thing is the transitional phase when you're getting into ketosis there's
a thing called keto fatigue has anyone ever experienced that so i had a chance
to just work with a lot of people and find out this is mostly potassium deficiency
and when you do keto you're no longer running in carbs so you're going to dump a lot of fluid
because carbs retain fluid with that fluid becomes electrolytes not just potassium but sodium now our
bodies tend to retain sodium more than potassium we don't have um any mechanism to retain potassium
hardly at all so there's this false information being spread that spread out there that potassium
is dangerous on our body if you have well of course if you have staged kidney disease
yes but if you have healthy kidneys it's not dangerous in fact potassium is protective of
the kidney if you want date on that i have amazing research on that you can you can ask me later but
but the thing about potassium is out of all the nutrients we need potassium in
large amounts 4,700 milligrams a day if you take a look at what you have to eat to consume that
you're going to find out the majority of people are just not consuming enough potassium
so um potassium is involved with a lot of things fluid exchange energy it buffers uric acid
it's really an effective thing for blood pressure wow it just brings blood pressure
down there's a lot of data on this also heart rhythm rhythm um really helps with arrhythmias
because it's involved in the pacemaker nerve and energy muscle
making hcl but the main purpose of potassium is involved in the sodium
potassium pump in the cells so you have these little pumps on the cell surface that
you have a billion of them let me just go right to that first
yeah this is what they look like they have one purpose to keep the potassium inside the cell
and the sodium outside the cell to keep this electrical gradient to keep these two minerals
separate that forms through the help of the insulated wall of that cell it helps to form
develop a battery the body allocates 30 of all of its energy to these pumps
and what the what what this energy this electrical energy does is it it activates
the nerve and the muscle tissue so if you're deficient and this pump doesn't have enough
raw material you're going to get weakness and uh in the muscle and things like that and
so this is one wikipedia so you know it's true they said it's the causes of hypokalemia low
potassium is uh look at the cause one of the causes is going a ketogenic diet i don't know if
i believe that but i do know that you'd lose fluid um with this and so that could be the reason why
also one of the big symptoms of hypokalemia the first one is feeling tired so if you if you're
into exercise and you're doing endurance exercise if you take a little more potassium you're going
to find you can go a lot longer too because your your cellular pumps have are are recharged so
to prevent that i i recommend foods that are high in um potassium on the ketogenic diet i don't want
to get too much into this but the potassium and the the insulated phospholipid layer on the cell
acts as a capacitor which basically stores electrical charge your cells are batteries and
if you divide the amount of voltage which is uh 150 microvolts inside the cell by
the thickness of the wall which is very small it can yield electrical fields in excess
of 200 kilovolts that's 200,000 volts so certainly enough to break down any
most insulators so if you compare that to anything like underground cables
it smokes anything else so your cells are just amazing how it can generate this incredible
amount of voltage and activate muscles and if you make sure that you give it the right nutrients
beet tops have the most potassium per cup 1300 so i mean i don't consume beet tops so
it's uh spinach the problem with spinach that i have on the keto is it's high in oxalates
if you're prone to kidney stones i have them avoid spinach brussels sprouts 600 something cabbage 300
tomatoes 400 swiss chard so you can see avocados 830 milligrams asparagus 400 so typically speaking
you're going to get a little more potassium with greens um but you can also get them from lamb you
can get potassium from lamb 2 268 for 3 ounces can of tuna is 280 round steak 3 ounces of 300
so you really just have to you should probably uh yourself or with a client just start calculating
how much potassium is a person really eating and you may find that it's not even close so you may
want to substitute with calcium citrate or another type of calcium i'm sorry potassium okay keto flu
is purely a salt deficiency sodium or chloride no one's really talking about chloride salt is
composed of 40 sodium 60 chlorides chlorides are really necessary to make the hydrochloric acid
so it's a very important mineral just as sodium so when you do keto you do need more sea salt
and so that will take care of the flu flu-like symptoms very quickly and also weak
muscles here's another gem if you don't know this this is a no-brainer
you're going to have clients come to you that have peripheral neuropathy and there's a really good
remedy that seems to work the majority of the time because hyperglycemia depletes vitamin b1
and b1 is involved in making myelin sheath it's it protects the cells against the complications
of high sugar it's considered a nerve vitamin when you're low in b1 you get neuritis
you get that excessive thinking thinking and like nervous anxiety um i like the best source of
b1 being nutritional yeast it's more of a natural type it rids lactic acid so if you put someone on
metformin one of the side effects it's rare is lactic acidosis b1 reduces that complication
so if you have someone on metformin if you have on b12 and b1 that would be very smart
it's involved in four different steps in the krebs cycle and the mitochondria in the generation
of atp so it's like the spark plug that occurs when you have fuel and oxygen coming into that
krebs cycle and so if you're not if you've been on a high carb diet you'll deplete b1
and that's when you start getting the complications of diabetes and
mainly it's the destruction of the vascular the capillary function the blood flow to the nerve
and the eye and the nerve and the also the epithelial cells in the heart and the kidney
as well as in the um the peripheral nerves not to mention the brain um so ben thought
to me if you've never heard of this it's a fat style will be one uh it's a no-brainer it it's
quite miraculous and they made it fat soluble to penetrate the myelin sheath in the brain
and it can be absorbed i think it's seven to nine times more than waterside will be one but it's a
really um you start like you just get a bottle of it and have them take uh you know four four
times a day whatever the recommended dosage is and uh it seems to work for peripheral neuropathies
i will say that some people if it's really bad it does take months to kick in
alpha lipoic acid also is good as well but it reduces the oxidative stress
and the complications of diabetes i have a lot of references if you want it hair loss okay
so you have sometimes people say well keto is very healthy because you're going to lose all your hair
well that's probably um if you're doing it incorrectly if you
the the main thing with the hair loss is you need certain trace minerals
not just for the thyroid um but for the hair directly so the two trace minerals that seem
to work the majority of time are zinc and selenium and they both are actually involved in the thyroid
um there's biotin is another really good one as well if someone has gut issues it could be the
reason why they're not your body makes biotin so it could be either that you have you don't
have the friendly bacteria to make biotin or you have gut damage that you're not able to
absorb that biotin so sometimes i'll give people biotin in higher amounts to kick in the hair
but zinc is a really important thing so what i do is i make sure that
they do what's called a healthy version of keto which is high density
nutrient foods especially the trace minerals and that would be the shellfish
these are high zinc foods tuna eggs pumpkin seeds lamb fish as well as selenium is another
important one selenium is probably one of the most important trace mineral antioxidants really
important in the thyroid especially hashimoto's because you have all this inflammatory reactions
and to counter all that free radical damage that's happening with hydrogen peroxide and
so selenium is really important and where do you get it you get it actually in fish and seafood so
this is just a chart to show you the the mercury some people are concerned about mercury as long as
you have enough selenium it'll counter the mercury so like the three types of fish that you wouldn't
want to consume would be pilot whale which i know i i really love that uh mako shark or swordfish
but everything else is is pretty good so you don't necessarily have to work worry about that
selenium tuna brazil nuts eggs sardines halibut sunflower seeds spinach and beef shellfish you
can see that different different uh nutrients contain a lot of different trace minerals uh so a
well rounded meal would be fine shellfish i think is is great for keto as long as it's a you know
healthy version key additional because i'm trying to go fast because i can see the times
running out here key foods i do recommend a small amount of dairy for certain people
but if they start getting acne if they have problems with fibroids if they have
a prostate problem i'm going to take them off dairy um but because i'm from wisconsin
um i like high quality dairy and of course i do the grass-fed uh organic um at halloween we gave
out um these little mini packs and you know these kids just don't come back anymore i don't know why
i want to thank you for coming and listening and have a wonderful afternoon thank you very much

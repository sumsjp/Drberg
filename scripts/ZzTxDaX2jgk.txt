so this question keeps coming up over and over and over so I just wanted to
create a video to answer it okay when do you lower your dietary fat during keto
or do you well there's a couple things you need to know about this number one a
high fat diet is only bad when you combine it with carbs if you think what
makes keto keto is high fat diet it's not true
it's the lowering of carbs just by doing high fat that doesn't make it keto if
you're doing high fat and high carbs that's not keto and that's gonna mess
everything up it's gonna create a lot of problems now there are certain programs
out there I won't mention any names ideal protein that are low carb and low
fat okay I found that to be very very hard on your liver and it creates a lot
of digestive issues so I wouldn't recommend doing a low carb and extreme
low fat especially if you're doing like low fat or lean proteins it's just
really hard on the body your body needs the the normal fat that comes with the
protein in order to have good digestion in fact when you go low-fat lean protein
you will spike insulin higher than if you had more fatty protein basically you
want to eat the fat that normally comes with protein in nature as a complex
don't try to go low fat or lean proteins there's a couple situations that come up
frequently that people want to know about what if you have a genetic high
cholesterol situation I found that when you do keto and you're really cut down
your carbs some people are able to lower their cholesterol with that and then yet
other people do need to cut down the fats that's between you and your doctor
but the point is you don't want to bring your cholesterol and fats down to like
zero maybe you want to keep it down to 75 grams and then get your doc to
reevaluate your cholesterol and see if things are okay and the other thing I
would recommend if you have a genetic problem cholesterol is to get an
advanced lipid profile test instead of just the general cholesterol test it's
going to tell you a lot more information about the two types of LDL and other
data as well the next reason why you may want to
lower your fat at least initially is if you are missing a gallbladder or don't
have enough file when you start consuming a large amount of fat from the
very get-go when you start keto some people might not have enough bile to be
able to digest that fat in which case they feel bloated especially underneath
the right ribcage burping belching right shoulder pain they have all the symptoms
of not being able to digest that fat because they don't have enough bile bile
is like the detergent that helps you dissolve grease and so if this happens
maybe you want to reduce the fat for a while so your body can start building up
its bowel reserves because your body will adapt so you can maybe bring your
fats down to 75 grams it really depends on how you're able to digest those fats
if you wanted to enhance your ability to digest fats take some purified bile
salts as a supplement choline works well and even the enzyme lipase all of these
will greatly help so you know it's just a judgment call as your body starts to
generate more bile over the next few weeks the last reason why you may want
to lower your fats is that you're doing keto for a period of time okay maybe a
month or two you're into it and you've dropped your carbs and you're eating
healthily and you're sleeping and your stress is fine and you plateaued
okay maybe at that point bring your fats down to 75 grams and that way your body
can start to tap in to your own fat reserves but for most people they won't
have a problem with doing keto they can digest the fat the cholesterol actually
comes down their gallbladder seems to work so you don't want to restrict fats
but you definitely want to restrict the carbs alright thanks for watching
so I just spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how
to bulletproof your immune system and there's 21 different lessons and I want
to give you this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is
sometimes people don't value it as much but I want to get it out there so I'm
just gonna give it to you free and I want to let you know that it's extremely
extremely valuable right now we're in a situation of uncertainty they're talking
about a second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that
maybe say who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room no
one is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm gonna
teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you can do to
strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements number one I want
you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands of people had this
information to protect themselves but not only that getting rid of the fear
factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean when you think about it
it's very similar to someone being bullied in school as soon as they learn
self defense they're gonna be less adversely affected by these bullies so
why not give you the information on your immune system so you know what to do to
protect yourself you see a lot of people that are scared I see them on exercise
like in in the park they're wearing a mask while they're
exercising or walking by themselves or in a car they're wearing a mask and a
shield so please share this course with everyone you know if you want to help
someone this is the best way to help them to give them the knowledge of how
to strengthen your immune system we want this to go viral in a healthy way
alright number two be active on your course and actually complete the course
okay take your time really learn the information there's questions that
you're gonna have to answer but stick with it number three semi er success
when you complete the course and sometimes when I talk to people they end
the conversation with be safe and I thought to myself what does that mean
be safe well wear the mask and also avoid getting too close to people right
well that's cool but what about strengthening the immune system that way
you could be not just safe but you could be very very smart because the missing
link is a strong immune system that gives you the ultimate protection I
really believe that the best thing that we can do both you and I to help people
is to spread this out and get everyone to know this information and here's what
I came up with for the top three people that share this course with the most
people I'm gonna give them a one-hour one-on-one video consult with dr. Burke
myself and we can talk about anything or your health or whatever and then for the
top 100 people that share this course I'm gonna give this group video
accidents to a very special webinar that's going to be live on a topic that
I can't necessarily do in a youtube video because it'll be taken down but
just realize it's going to be some very powerful information that you're gonna
learn that's going to really help you and people around you sorry to give you
that mystery but unfortunately social media is filtering out certain topics
right now and the top 100 will also get access to my virtual Quito summit at the
end of August last point to get access to this information you have to have
messenger now some of you don't use messenger and unfortunately everything
is set up a messenger so I would recommend signing up a messenger and if
you don't want to continue use it after the course just opt-out I think you're
really going to enjoy this course I put a lot of time into it the information is
down below and spread the word

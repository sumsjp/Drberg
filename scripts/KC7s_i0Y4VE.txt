so in this video we're going to talk about why you should always use a probiotic for any type
of liver problem that includes a fatty liver a liver that has inflammation as in hepatitis
or an advanced liver problem where you have cirrhosis which is scar tissue of the liver
and by the way one real simple way to know if you have a fatty liver is just to look down
and see if you can see your feet because what happens if your belly is sticking out
you have a fatty liver and an ultrasound will also pick it up very easily so the question is why
would a friendly bacteria in your colon help your liver since they're in two different locations
well probiotics prevent something called bacterial translocation let me kind of define that
when there's liver damage the bacteria in your colon which is the large intestine
have the ability to migrate or travel beyond the wall of your colon into your lymphatic system
so the bacteria are translocating in a different place once this bacteria gets into the lymphatic
system that's where you have all sorts of immune reactions and you're triggering cytokines in a
big way so you're going to get inflammation you're also going to increase something called endotoxins
which is kind of a byproduct of bacteria and you're going to increase tnf alpha which are
basically cytokines that create inflammation fatigue and other symptoms now the other cool
thing about probiotics is it reduces ammonia one of the side effects of advanced liver problems
is an excessive amount of ammonia that's in your blood that travels into the brain and
ammonia is a neurotoxin so it not only affects your mood but your memory your focus it can even
get so bad where actually you can go into a coma taking a probiotic which is a friendly bacteria
will actually reduce the unfriendly bacteria that are making excessive amounts of ammonia so taking
probiotics or getting probiotics from your food kombucha tea sauerkraut kimchi even kefir make
sure it's not sweetened make sure it's plain can significantly reduce symptoms associated with
liver disease as well as slow down fibrosis and reduce ammonia so in summary i just wanted to kind
of bring your awareness on a real simple solution to a lot of the symptoms and collateral damage
that occurs when you have liver damage and if you're new to my channel and you don't know what
to eat i put a link down below so you can get more data on that before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you

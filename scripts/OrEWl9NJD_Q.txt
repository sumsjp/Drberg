okay so today we're gonna uncomplicated minute fasting and actually make it very
easy for you okay it's actually quite simple
I mean intermittent fasting is basically not eating okay so it's not starving
it's just you're omitting all these frequent meals it's actually very very
simple but a lot of times people complicate it they want to know can I
have my supplements yes you can have your supplements yes you can
have your tea can I drink water yes you can drink
water you can have some coffee the point is that a true fast is just water and
nothing else okay but if we're adding supplements or tea or a little coffee
I'm going to still consider that fasting and you're not going to really break the
fast okay all right so here's the big thing about intermittent fasting to make
it really really simple you actually want to let your body dictate when to
feed it okay when to eat and also how long you're going to go without eating
so the time may vary because you only want to eat when you're hungry okay and
then not eat when you're not hungry and it might sound really simple but
sometimes you have to explain it to people because at the first hint of a
little slight hunger people just start eating I'm like that's not what we're
talking about because even in the morning at 8 o'clock a.m. you have a
hormonal spike of cortisol okay that's an adrenal hormone that's a stress
hormone that will make you a little hungry so you may find right in the
morning while I'm hungry and then that passes and then you're not hungry so
slight hunger is you want to just keep going ignore that what I'm talking about
is a strong hunger if stomach pains you started getting lightheaded weak grouchy
okay that means it's time to eat okay especially in the beginning you're gonna
have this you're gonna feel fine all this and you're gonna have these
symptoms and that's just a blood sugar crash so you'll have to just get used to
it but the more and more you do this the more you're gonna go from sugar burning
to fat burning more efficiently that takes time though okay so another factor
is the estimation of effort it takes to really get into this hard core so you're
fully in the key tell where it's comfortable you have cognitive benefits
you feel focused you have concentration you're a memory you can actually learn
faster so that's gonna happen over time but for some people it could take three
to four months okay and I'm talking about weight loss too especially in your
midsection and your blood sugars it just might take time because your whole life
you've done this way and now we're trying to undo it and it does take some
time so go into this for the long haul and just give it time okay alright the
other thing I want to talk about is how to start this whole thing the first
thing is like let's say for you're doing all these multiple meals per day you're
doing snacks the first thing is to lower your carbs okay that's number one
that's automatically gonna start helping you be less hungry so you can go longer
so now you go three meals no snacks okay that's the first goal it's really
important to add enough fat okay to go from one meal to the next very very
important it's also important to add enough vegetables to also help you go
from one meal to the next a big mistake that people make is they try to do this
without enough vegetables you need vegetables for the potassium and
magnesium and the other minerals and vitamins that help heal insulin
resistance and help lower insulin as well as the fiber that feeds the
microbes in your gut and that produces something called butyric acid which
helps insulin resistance it decreases hunger it helps blood sugars it feeds
the colon cells and it helps your immune system the combination of good fat and
vegetables is going to help you go from one note to the next and then just let
your body dictate when to eat so you're gonna find you can go longer so you skip
the breakfast now you add two meals a day and now you start to squish those
together slowly okay let your body tell you when to do it to the point where
you're not hungry anymore so then you just do one meal a day a lot of people
are doing this but you want to work up to it and just kind of keep it really
really simple give it time these are just principles
there's a tea called hoodia gardenia
which is basically a an appetite suppressant tea it's very very powerful
in attacks and that you can try doing that if you want to actually have it
help you a little bit there's other teas as well you can keep very very busy
because there's nothing worse than you sitting at home from the computer and
watching the clock like what am I gonna eat so you want to probably get out of
the house go somewhere because that can really help you find some activities but
don't just sit and at home alright sea salt very very important because if you
don't consume enough sodium and you're drinking water you're diluting a little
bit of sodium because you may not have enough reserve in your tank of minerals
and that to draw on through the fasting so the way that you know that you have
enough sea salt is that you're not having any headaches you're not feeling
weak muscles you're feeling strong but a lot of people have side effects because
they're not doing enough sea salt okay I would do one flat to the level teaspoon
a day you can put that in your food you can even make it mix it with water some
of it not the whole thing and drink that down electrolytes are very very
important to for potassium magnesium calcium and find one with high potassium
and then that will actually also help you have energy through this as well
because when you make the transition you need these nutrients you don't also
need me vitamins too so I just want to throw that out there nutritional yeast
tablets would help you but that will just make the transition smoother the
last thing I want to talk about is just make sure that you prepare for what
you're going to be eating so let's say for example you don't really know when
you're gonna eat because you're gonna go as long as you can with until you're
hungry bring your food with you if you're going somewhere but just be
prepared because what we don't want to do is be like wow now I'm really hungry
and I have no more food because the problem with them and fasting is that
the timing of it you know it's like it's sometimes it's hard to time exactly when
you're gonna eat and coordinate that with other people so have your food
available so you can go to the correct food and if you don't know about that I
put a link down below I think I uncomplicated the intermittent fasting

hey guys in this video we're going to talk about the missing nutrients okay what are
the missing nutrients trace minerals what are tracing those trace minerals are those minerals
needed in much smaller amounts usually below 100 milligrams okay so that would be like chromium
zinc copper selenium iodine cobalt versus other minerals you need in large amounts
like potassium calcium magnesium you need those in much larger amounts so what do trace minerals
do they basically help you make proteins work in your body okay so in order to make hair now
skin hormones tendons ligaments discs bone and muscle you need trace minerals and there's a
lot of deficiencies that can occur with like even chromium you can start having a blood sugar issue
chromium house blood sugars zinc is very very important in your immune system and also putting
viruses back in remission and even skin issues preventing skin issues copper very important in
adrenal health hormone health cortisol stress hormone selenium is really good for the liver
in the detoxification process iodine I think you might need that for the thyroid cobalt for
the blood as in building b12 okay and so the type of minerals that I recommend our plant base trace
minerals okay why because plant based trace minerals are 15,000 times smaller then other
minerals like it's called elemental or salt based minerals like you wouldn't necessarily want to go
into the dirt and take a spoonful of dirt and consume that that would be elemental normally
what happens is the plant absorbs the mineral from the earth pulls it and converts it into a
plant-based mineral where you can consume it but if you actually buy minerals at the store like
calcium carbonate and some of these other minerals that they're selling they're not plant based their
elemental so that's why you probably a hard time absorbing them this is 100% absorbed this
is probably if you're lucky for a 5% absorbed so it has to do if you ever taken a chemistry
class it has to do it the way the minerals are bound up there's certain bonds that connect
them plant-based minerals have covalent bonds easy to break elemental have ionic bonds really
hard to break up so they're not well absorbed you also need a very acidic stomach to absorb
minerals in general so if you have a heartburn chances are you don't have enough acid to pull
it in and as you age you lose your stomach acid so a little bit about cider vinegar with water
each day will help you absorb minerals in general but anyway trace minerals provide the cofactors
for enzymes that actually again help build up the body tissue and problem with especially in
America in other countries to the soils are so processed and they're not replenished with trace
minerals that you're actually missing on trace minerals in our soils so if a plant is grown on
soil it doesn't have the trace mineral it's not going to get the trace mineral it has to come
from somewhere so you're consuming food which is nutrient deficient okay now if you consume
food like on a volcanic soils where they used to have volcanoes like Hawaii the Caribbean islands
Africa South America different countries and even places in America Philadelphia and Sylvania were
even in Wisconsin where they had the kettle rain all the glaciers that came through and
deposited all these minerals you have a lot of farmland it's a very very nutrient rich okay
but in other areas where you're getting food you're getting depletion of these minerals so
one of the things that you may want to do is get a supplement others the one that I use is that this
right here is called trace minerals at the plant base this is basically 79 million years old and
Jurassic period which is about hundred forty five million years at the end of that there was a lot
of prehistoric vegetation that was preserved in the earth so this is basically prehistoric plant
life liquefied you would take a dropper full a day in some water it doesn't taste like anything
and just to start getting your minerals and it's a 100 percent absorbed and it has over 70 trace
minerals okay okay so thanks for watching and put your comments below hey you probably already

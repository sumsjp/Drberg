oh I ABS absolutely felt as though it
was worth a lot of money to go to the
seminars I couldn't believe it was free
um every single minute was interesting
and actually exciting and on top of that
he's humorous and funny so I really
enjoy him um it's I have never learned
so much in a short span of time and when
it's over you really don't want it to be
over and I've been to actually two of
his seminars and people don't leave you
know they stay and what more

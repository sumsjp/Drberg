today i want to talk about keto desserts or keto snacks which i never recommend except at the end
of a meal and gut issues now the short version is you do not want to consume keto desserts or snacks
if you have gut issues so you don't want any of these ingredients okay but let me explain why
because the keto bombs cakes cookies or if you're going to do waffles or pancakes
all contain certain ingredients that will just add to the inflammation in your gut i'm talking about
if you have irritable bowel syndrome or ulcerative colitis or diverticulitis or crohn's or celiac
or any inflammation your colon you want to stay away from these ingredients so let's go through
the ingredients so starting with sugar alcohols you have erythritol with stevia or you have
erythritol with monk fruit now if you don't have a gut issue this would be a good option
second option would be xylitol now if we compare xylitol with erythritol this is better because
erythritol is 30 on the glycemic index now if you're having very small amounts it's not going
to be that big of a deal i personally consume a little xylitol in my coffee every day it's
one small packet extremely small doesn't affect my blood sugars at all but this should be zero
but if you have a gut issue i don't recommend it maltitol is one of the worst sugar alcohols it'll
really tear up your gut and it's pretty high on the glycemic index and then you have this
thing called imo isomaltooligosaccharides another name for that is vita fiber now
i did a video a long time ago recommending this until i found some interest in your research on
it and now i do not recommend it because it can definitely increase your blood sugars big
time it's usually in the syrup so you can make all sorts of amazing things and it gives great texture
for all sorts of keto desserts and it's very sweet but in reality it's not keto friendly that's why
it tastes so great all right the other things you need to avoid are the flour alternatives so
when you do keto you're no longer doing grains like wheat flour so you do almond flour coconut
flour chia seed flour chickpea flour or hazelnut flour these will tear up your gut you want to
avoid these as well and then we get to vegetable fats now most vegetable fats are high in omega-6
it's going to create more inflammation like safflower oil sunflower oil especially corn and
soy you're going to see these in restaurant food so if you go out to dinner a lot
regardless of whether you order keto or not a lot of times they're going to fry the food or cook the
food in these two oils and you may wonder why your stomach is inflamed that is why now coconut oil is
a plant fat and it is not that great if you have severe gut issues so you can test it out might
be okay but it may not be good for you and of course nuts and seeds you want to avoid those
because if you have a gut issue it can really create an inflammatory process because these
are very high in omega-6 fats so the worse the gut issue the more you need to do carnivore which is
keto but without all this other stuff you're pretty much just doing animal fat and protein
maybe a little bit of fermented vegetables but if your gut is very very severe even those might be a
problem but if it's a moderate problem you could pretty much handle a small amount of fermented
vegetables now let's say for example your gut is inflamed or you have this autoimmune
condition which always stems from the gut you want to do this ratio two to one fat to protein
but mainly stick with animal fats and animal proteins so you'd want to do carnivore
without plant fats like you wouldn't want to do with coconut oil or even avocados and because
there's a lot of inflammation in your gut you don't even want to do any type of dairy whatsoever
that includes cream butter a small amount of ghee might be okay because ghee actually filters out
some of the solids some of the potential proteins like casein that you might be sensitive to
and with gut issues some people are sensitive to eggs as well so unfortunately
you're very restrictive but if you only consume very very fatty uh
meats on a keto and i'm not just talking about using meat i'm talking about organ meats as well
fatty sausage to fatty fish would be a very very good thing to help heal your gut issues so you
would do that for a period of time and then you'd want to slowly ease into the fermented vegetables
but you probably are not going to be able to tolerate these keto desserts and so-called
keto friendly snacks if you have a history of gut issues all right guys for a little more
information on this i put a video down below check it out before you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you

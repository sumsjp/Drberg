alright so in this video we're gonna we're gonna discuss the symptom of
excessive thirst okay now the first thing I want to say is that a lot of
people are drinking water just out of a habit either they've been told to drink
a lot of water it's just a natural thing they're doing but they're not really
thirsty and that could be a problem if you're drinking a gallon of water or
more you're not exercising you may develop something called hyponatremia
which is a situation where you have low sodium in the body think about this when
you're drinking all this water without electrolytes and without salt you're
actually diluting sodium so you're creating a sodium deficiency and that
can set you up for all sorts of issues so number one just drink when you're
thirsty okay and of course if you're exercising you're gonna be drinking a
lot more number two and this is probably the most common reason why someone has
excessive thirst they have diabetes or they're pre-diabetic or they have blood
sugar issues because they have insulin resistance realize this wherever the
sugar goes the water follows so if you have all this sugar in your body and
it's going into your bloodstream and it's going out of the bloodstream and
then it's gonna go out to the kidney and be filtered out
guess what water's gonna go with it if you have either diabetes or you're
consuming a lot of sugar typically what's gonna happen you're gonna lose
more water and that's gonna trigger something in your brain that tells you
to drink more diabetics are usually thirst here and they're peeing more now
we're talking about diabetes mellitus okay there's another type of diabetes
called insipidus this is a situation where you're you're very very thirsty
all the time especially for like cold water or ice water and you're peeing a
lot and that could be very damaging to the body because you're going to get
really dehydrated but this mechanism is different than this right here this
could be a problem with a tumor in your pituitary gland it could be a problem
with the kidney it's just a different mechanism number three if you're low on
potassium let's say for example you don't need vegetables you don't like
them you don't need them or you're not taking a potassium supplement that alone
can cause excessive thirst and of course if you have high sodium in the
diet I saw diet low potassium you're gonna be a lot more thirsty and also if
you're consuming foods with hidden sodium as in monosodium glutamate and
that's in all the fast food but potassium and sodium work together and
usually if you're doing high sodium you're gonna have low potassium if you
have low potassium you're gonna have a higher ratio of high sodium and the
combination of both of these are gonna give you more of a sensation of thirst
number five certain drugs will create excessive thirst diuretics especially
steroids psych drugs and there's many others number six if you have higher
amounts of calcium in the blood it's called hyper calcium yeah this condition
will trigger similar effects to diabetes excessive thirst as well as increase
urination one rare cause would be having cancer or you may have what's called
hyperparathyroidism with parathyroid gland you have four of them they're
located right behind the thyroid if there's a little tumor in one of them
that can create a situation when your calcium goes up if you're taking a
lithium of that can cause high calcium if you're also taking a very large
amount of vitamin D that potentially could cause high amounts of calcium but
realize that you would have to take probably over a hundred thousand I use a
vitamin D over a good amount of time it's not very common if you're taking
normal doses of vitamin D and I put some information down below if you're
concerned about that because sometimes people think if you're gonna take even
20,000 IU's or 30,000 IUs of vitamin D that's gonna create hyper calcium but
it's really not so I want you to get the data on that so this is what you need to
do drink when you're thirsty make sure you're getting enough sea salt in the
diet but not to overdo it one teaspoon would be sufficient you put
that within your meal through the day and then you're good to go and the lower
the amount of carbohydrates in the diet the more salt that you need okay also
having a low carb diet help you with the thirst why is that
because higher amounts of carbohydrate turn into this which caused this and
lastly having enough potassium in your diet that will create more hydration and
help balance out the sodium and reduce the thirst alright thanks for watching
and I'll see you shortly in the next video
so I just spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how
to bulletproof your immune system and there's 21 different lessons and I want
to give you this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is
sometimes people don't value it as much but I want to get it out there so I'm
just gonna give it to you free and I want to let you know that it's extremely
extremely valuable right now we're in a situation of uncertainty they're talking
about a second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that
maybe say who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room no
one is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm gonna
teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you can do to
strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements number one I want
you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands of people had this
information to protect themselves but not only that getting rid of the fear
factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean when you think about it
it's very similar to someone being bullied in school as soon as they learn
self-defense they're gonna be less adversely affected by these bullies so
why not give you the information on your immune system so you know what to do to
protect yourself you see a lot of people that are scared I see them on exercise
like in in the park they're wearing a mask while they're exercising or walking
by themselves or in a car they're wearing a mask and a shield so please
share this course with everyone you know if you want to help someone this is
the best way to help them to give them the knowledge of how to strengthen your
immune system we want this to go viral in a healthy way alright number two be
active on your course and actually complete the course okay take your time
really learn the information there's questions that you're gonna have to
answer but stick with it but number three
send me your success when you complete the course and sometimes when I talk to
people they end the conversation with be safe and I thought to myself what does
that mean be safe well wear the mask and also avoid getting too close to people
right well that's cool but what about strengthening the immune system that way
you could be not just safe but you could be very very smart because the missing
link is a strong immune system that gives you the ultimate protection I
really believe that the best thing that we can do both you and I to help people
is to spread this out and get everyone to know this information and here's what
I came up with for the top three people that share this course with the most
people I'm gonna give them a one-hour one-on-one video consult with dr. Berg
myself and we can talk about anything or your health or whatever and then for the
top 100 people that share this course I'm gonna give this group video access
to a very special webinar that's going to be live on a topic that I can't
necessarily do in a YouTube video because it'll be taken down but just
realize it's going to be some very powerful information that you're gonna
learn that's gonna really help you and people around you sorry to give you that
mystery but unfortunately social media is filtering out certain topics right
now and the top 100 will also get access to my virtual keto summit at the end of
August last point do you get access to this information you have to have
messenger now some of you don't use messenger and unfortunately everything
is set up a messenger so I would recommend signing up a messenger and if
you don't want to continue use it after the course
just opt-out I think you're really going to enjoy this course I put a lot of time
into it the information is down below and spread the word

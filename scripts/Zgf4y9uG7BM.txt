i want to talk about the difference between vitamin d2 and vitamin d3
are they the same there are physicians that tell you they're exactly the same there's
no difference but let's let's talk about the facts first of all vitamin d2 mainly is made
synthetically it does come from mushrooms but i'll guarantee that the majority of the population
do not get their vitamin d to from mushrooms now vitamin d3 are animal source foods like fatty fish
salmon for example sardines red meat cod liver and cod liver oil
liver egg yolks butter have the natural d3 now the interesting thing about vitamin d2 there's
not a significant amount of studies on d2 mainly d3 and the studies on vitamin d2 did not have
the decreased mortality benefit that d3 has so if you're trying to live longer with vitamin d
you're not going to get it from vitamin d2 only vitamin d3 now lichen in microalgae
has a blend of d3 and d2 the positive thing about vitamin d2 it's it's very inexpensive
but the problem is you need more of it to see the results so it's basically less effective d3
is five times faster in the conversion because when you get vitamin d3 whether it's
a supplement or your food has to be converted to activate it and that's through the liver
and the kidney it's less toxic and it's definitely more stable it stays around longer in your blood
but it is definitely not the same hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how
to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's

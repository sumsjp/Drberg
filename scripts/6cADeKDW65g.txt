let's talk about the nutrient reasons for cold intolerance so there's a lot of people that have
cold sensitivity and they're they're always cold so let's go into the nutrition
connection first one is if you are deficient in iodine selenium or
zinc all three of these trace minerals are intimately involved in supporting thyroid function
iodine is needed as part of the thyroid hormone itself so when you have like t4 or t3 the three
and the four represent the number of iodine molecules as a part of that hormone selenium is
needed in an essential way to convert the inactive thyroid hormone to the active thyroid
hormone which is t3 so we need selenium to do this conversion we also need zinc to convert as well
and so if you're deficient in either one of these trace minerals that could be one reason why you're
cold all right number two low iron as in anemia or it could be also anemia coming from low b12
people that have anemia are cold and so the best source of iron would be not spinach but red meat
okay and by the way the best source of these trace minerals are shellfish now iron is also needed
in the metabolism of brown fat which by the way has a primary function of thermoregulation
interesting number three if you have raynaud's syndrome where your fingers literally get blue
when you come in contact with cold that could stem from a vitamin b1 deficiency because vitamin b1
is involved in the autonomic nervous system which helps to push blood through the body
and so if you have raynaud's syndrome definitely take b1 and another vitamin
that will also help this condition called inositol hexanocotinate all right number four
insulin resistance okay if you're on keto if you're doing intermittent fasting
and you're finding you get cold chances are you're just not fat adapted yet why because
you have an underlying insulin resistance situation which could take months to correct
chromium is probably one of the most important trace minerals to help keep insulin sensitive and
so if you're deficient in chromium then insulin is not going to be sensitive so it's going to
you're going to have resistance to insulin and you're going to have a difficult time adapting to
burning more fat so chromium a very important trace mineral to help with this right here now
at the cellular level we're talking about the mitochondria where the energy is being produced
you have this little factory and you have this chemical pathway called the krebs cycle and if you
took biochemistry you know what i'm talking about almost every chemical change that occurs in that
cycle of generating energy involves the b vitamins b1 b2 b3 b5 and b6 so if you're deficient in the
b vitamins you're going to have a difficult time making cellular energy because the mitochondria
can't work and so taking these through nutritional yeast can definitely increase your overall energy
as well as your warmth of your your body all right so there's other reasons for being cold but these
mainly are related to the nutrient connection thanks for watching before you go if you have
a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

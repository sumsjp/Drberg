hey we're back hi what is this this is blueberry cocoa now what is it mm-mm it
is a coconut almond raspberry bark hmm what's in it
it's too late coconut and raspberries let me guess
am i right you are the winner where's my you're right button you should have that
button I should have that right here what is this so good
speaking about raspberries oh did you realize that the small intestine is 23
feet and the large intestine is five which equals 28 feet of digestive system
not counting the stomach just a bit of trivia I am so glad to know that mm-hmm
this is really good actually that's pretty good
now the secret what's the secret when you make a fat bomb and this has like a
chocolate bark on it I'm not sure using a lot even if you're using a lot of
coconut oil or whatever you need to keep them in the fridge
probably the freezer but the key is to let it rest on the counter for maybe
three minutes max five minutes before you enjoy it I just think the flavors
are so much better okay and um it's more nummy and what you're going for is
the nummy right a fat bomb you're getting the fat but you're also getting the num
sounds good okay all right here's how to make it

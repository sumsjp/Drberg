so if you have a weird taste in your mouth and you're not sure exactly where it could be coming
from i want to help you identify the root cause of it and there's quite a few reasons for this
number one it could be oral thrush or candida which is growing in your mouth now if that's the
situation which can stem from situations where you had antibiotics or you're eating a lot of sugar
because candida loves sugar so number one you have to get off sugar and refined carbs so this is what
you want to do you want to take a liquid probiotic non-dairy and put a little bit in your mouth like
a little capful and swish it around your mouth because those microbes will compete with the
candida and they will eat up the nutrition in your mouth and cause great difficulty for candida to
live so that would be one thing number two start consuming apple cider vinegar in your water very
important and make sure some of that gets in your mouth as well because that acidity can help kill
off candida sea salt in water flush that rinse your mouth very well again you can you're making
an environment that's very difficult for candida to live but ultimately you want to work in your
gut you want to really get your diet corrected to get rid of this it's not necessarily coming
because you're not brushing your teeth okay all right next thing is pregnancy women that
are pregnant they can notice like a weird taste in their mouth that usually is a nutrient deficiency
mostly zinc so make sure you take enough zinc the the food that has the highest zinc
is oysters but you can get zinc from red meat and many other foods all right number three
menopause this is the shift in estrogen and that can affect the liver what i recommend in
this situation is bile salts which will help the liver detoxify and help get rid of things that can
actually create that metallic taste all right next one is diabetes okay when you have diabetes a lot
of times you have nerve damage and that nerve that affects the taste and the smell can be affected
one of the best remedies is benfotamine which is a fat soluble b vitamin that can help restore
the nervous system okay so that's what i recommend if you have blood sugar issues number five
liver problems this is probably the most common thing because the liver helps you
get rid of toxins it's not a storage facility for toxins it just helps you detoxify poisons
so what you want to do is build up the main antioxidant called glutathione how do you do
that by adding selenium to the diet by taking milk thistle by consuming more cruciferous
vegetables and by fasting okay that can get the liver working better so you can get rid of toxic
things like heavy metals number six low zinc i've already mentioned this but if you don't have zinc
it can really affect your sense of smell and give you a weird taste okay number seven acid reflux
the acid that comes up from the gut can come up in your mouth and definitely give you a weird taste
if this is the case there's so many things to do apple cider vinegar would be good betaine
hydrochloride would most likely help but i put a link down below of what to do if you have that
number eight a sinus infection this can give you a weird taste because you have this post nasal drip
and um it might sound like i have a nasal problem but i don't it's the mic this mic makes me sound
like i have a nasal problem or deeper voice i don't because if you hear me in my studio i don't
have that sound now for a sinus infection i've done videos on this neti pot type nasal rinses are
great but i'm going to put a link down below if you have this because it's more involved and it's
not just a quick thing and number nine the keto diet in the transition phase when you're adapting
to keto there are certain types of ketones that are generated that could start to give you the
smell or a taste of acetone which is nail polish remover realize this is temporary it will go away
it's nothing that's going to be permanent and it's not a bad thing all right there you have it

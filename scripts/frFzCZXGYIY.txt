let's talk about how keto the ketogenic diet could potentially help protect your
immune system especially when we're talking about the coronavirus now check
this out ninety nine point two percent of all deaths from COVID-19 are
associated with metabolic syndrome and this syndrome your immune system is
compromised big-time now those who do not have other health conditions but die
only have a point eight percent chance of dying versus if you have pre-existing
health problems like blood pressure diabetes heart condition cancer raise
your chance of dying to ninety nine point two percent now let's take a look
at what is the common denominator of some of these conditions well high blood
pressure most cases of hypertension and I'm talking ninety percent of all of the
hypertensive patients have what's called essential hypertension essential meaning
they don't know what causes it I'm gonna put a link down below of this paper that
talks about the interrelationship between insulin resistance and
hypertension in some resistance in compensatory hyperinsulinemia that means
that you're having high amounts of insulin in the blood as a compensation
so let me just draw this out tankers right here it's sending insulin okay
into the cells but you have insulin resistance right so it's it's gonna be
low right here so the signals won't get back to the pancreas so there's no
feedback loop so if there's no feedback loop to turn it off the pancreas will
make more and more in more and more and this is why people with insulin
resistance have five to seven times more production of insulin in other words
people with instant resistance have a tremendous amount of insulin in the body
but it's not working that's what they mean by compensatory hyper insulin emia
that means insulin in the blood commonly occurs in patients with untreated
essential hypertension the coexistence of instant resistance
and hypertension can be viewed as a cause-effect relationship Wow
that's powerful now I would imagine this is probably a lot less if you factor in
insulin resistance itself which I know for a fact they rarely test that and
especially with these cases they're not testing if the person has insulin
resistance which could be a pre-diabetic condition in fact in America it's been
estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the entire population has some level of
insulin resistance so this point eight percent could be on an 0.2 percent
bringing this level up to ninety-nine point eight percent potentially so in
summary what happens when you go on keto this is what you do with this is what
you improve healthy insulin levels you basically get insulin to the level where
it's no longer high and guess what many times your blood pressure improves your
diabetes type two improves the cardiovascular system gets improving I'm
gonna put links down below showing you those connections as well another vital
reason why people should do keto and especially intermittent fasting to
support their immune systems so we can actually minimize the risk of dying if
the person gets infected if you want information about insulin resistance

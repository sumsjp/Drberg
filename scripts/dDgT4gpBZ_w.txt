Hey, dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about the relationship
between protein and fat burning you probably already know this but I'm just
going to make sure that you have all the details because if protein did cause fat
burning why isn't everyone skinny right so this is how it works
protein does have the capacity to trigger three main hormones that then
trigger the fat burning process so these are the three main fat burning hormones
the first one is called growth hormone it's made by a little gland in the
pituitary up in your brain that is sent down into the liver so growth hormone is
made by the pituitary but it works through your liver alright and it is
triggered by protein next hormone is IGF number one that's insulin like growth
factor number one and that is a hormone that is
actually made by your liver it works very close to the growth hormone in fact
it's triggered by growth hormone but it's also triggered by protein
consumption so that's another hormone that's made from the liver and then that
helps you trigger fat burning and there's one more it's called glucagon
now it sounds like glucose but it's not glucose glucagon is a kind of a funny
name for a hormone that's made from your pancreas and it opposes it does the
opposite of insulin so if insulin causes you to store fat
glucagon causes you to release fat and that too is a hormone that is triggered
by protein but here are some rules on the protein number one it can't be in
excess amounts so if you're consuming large quantities of protein that can
stop your fat burning process in fact it can trigger insulin so we don't want to
do too much just a little bit like three ounces depending on your size it could
be anywhere between three ounces per meal or six ounces per meal alright not
a 12 ounce steak like a 20 gram if you have a good quality protein powder if
it's 20 grams that would be a good supply per meal okay so that would be
the quantity the quality needs to be high and what I mean by quality
cannot contain something like soy soy protein isolates creates a lot of damage
on the liver and it's a very low quality protein source it's not a natural source
whey protein can be tolerated on some people but I find when I consume it I
almost can feel my liver getting irritated so it does tend to affect
people differently so it I don't really like it as the best source but if you
were going to do whey protein and make sure that you're doing grass-fed not
grain-fed because that would be even worse okay so now we also have no sugar
added so typically when people eat protein they add sugar to it like a
Chinese restaurant or they bread it or they add ketchup to it or they add some
type of sweetener like deli meats they put dextrose in it we don't want to
consume sugar with protein that's going to completely block any potential
ability to burn fat but it's also going to trigger insulin again that hormone
that will counter the fat burning process and it'll actually make you fat
digestibility some people do not have the capacity to digest red meat they it
irritates their system so maybe they want to do fish you know seafood things
like that so you really want to look at the ability to digest the protein I
found that some of the protein sources like hemp tends to bloat people so you
want to find a protein that is that does well on your body that doesn't cause
bloating and as you age you lose the stomach acids as well and so if you
consume protein and you you get gas or you get bloating it could mean you just
need to add betaine hydrochloride which is a little bit of a acidifier that you
can get from the health of store that will actually make the stomach acid and
then you can digest protein stomachs that don't have enough acid cannot
digest protein and that's one of the things that's very important in having a
stomach at that's very very acid because if you don't you get a rotting affect of
the protein turns into gas and a lot of people as
they get older they don't have that acid one way that you know you don't have
enough acid is if you have acid reflux or indigestion so you would think you
have too much acid but it's just the opposite and I have a video on that you
can watch that actually I'll put the video link down below because if you have acid
reflux that means you don't have enough acid and then if you eat protein is
going to create more problems all right very important digestibility
non-allergic so if you're consuming protein that you're allergic to egg
whites for example that could be a big problem make sure you consume a protein
that is digestible you're not allergic to that's just kind of common sense has
to be complete the problem with vegetarian sources of
protein it's a lot of times it's not complete so they're consuming like a
rice protein or a bean protein it doesn't have all the amino acids and it
creates problems of deficiencies of other amino acids all right the one that
I like the most if I was going to do a protein powder is the pea protein
non-gmo it's easy to digest it's complete it has what's called branch
amino acids which are good for recovery from exercise it's a really good source
of quality protein I use it in the kale shake I have it in the new kale shake
which actually has the extra protein but it's a great meal replacement and it's
easy it's it tastes good as well some of the protein powders it's like not very
tasty so you can't really mix it with other things so in other words I now you
are enlightened on protein and maybe you can use this information to help
yourself burn a little bit more fat but the point is that protein is one of the
triggers for fat burning in addition to many other things which we'll get into
in some other of seminars or actually videos so I hope this helped and I will
see you in the next video

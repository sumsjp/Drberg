people notice that they say oh you have
you got slimmer you lost weight
and i really haven't lost any weight but
the inches are just coming off
and i'm more vibrant and now i could
walk i used
i'm a walker anyway but now i walk i
walk like 10
15 miles with no problem because i had
knee problems
and now my knees don't hurt anymore so
that just makes me feel great it makes
me feel like i just do
anything that i want now

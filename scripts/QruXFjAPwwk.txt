i'm going to recommend consuming one brazil nut every single day as this part of your routine why
because one brazil nut contains roughly between 68 to 91 micrograms of selenium and i'm going
to talk about the importance of selenium we need it it's essential and many people are deficient
the daily value of selenium that we need is about 55 micrograms so one nut would totally prevent a
deficiency about 500 million to 1 billion people on planet earth are deficient now there's a lot
more that have subclinical deficiencies and selenium is a trace mineral it's in the soils
and the plant is supposed to absorb it if the plant has the necessary microorganisms
in the soil to make it available to the plant and also if there's selenium in the soil because
selenium is not distributed evenly on the earth's crust there's certain pockets it's
more on the coastline and it's more associated with soils that are rich in iodine and so we
know a lot of soils are deficient in iodine chances are they're also deficient in selenium
the other problem with selenium in the soil is that when we fertilize the soil with npk which
is a conventional type fertilizer the phosphorus that's the p will make selenium unavailable as
well so unless you're putting selenium in soil chances are it's not going to be in the soil
for the plant to absorb and then you eat the plant or you eat the animals eat the plants
and you're going to be deficient i'm also going to recommend that you consume a organic brazil nut
because you don't know if they spray these nuts after they harvest them but selenium is a very
powerful antioxidant it can help oxidative damage free radical damage and it is also a building
block to make glutathione which is probably the most powerful antioxidant in the body
selenium also has the ability to decrease something called tpo antibodies by 21 and that has
to do with hashimoto's the autoimmune condition in thyroid problems slow thyroid conditions as in
hypothyroidism this is why selenium is very very important in decreasing those antibodies and also
helping you convert from t4 to t3 so selenium will also help protect against cancer
because it prevents the damage to the dna of cells especially the mitochondria it helps to support
cardiovascular damage it helps the immune system it helps the thyroid conversion like i just
mentioned before it helps build glutathione which i've talked about that's why it's good for the
liver and it also will decrease the toxic effects of mercury lead cadmium and other heavy minerals
so because we live in a toxic environment and most people are deficient in selenium
you might want to consume one brazil nut make sure it's organic every day
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

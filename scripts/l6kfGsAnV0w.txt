let's talk about the three fats that have the potential to reverse a fatty
liver so many people are freaked out about fat
and they have this thing in their mind that if they ate any fat at all
they're gonna get a fatty liver but in reality what causes fatty liver
is more the carbohydrates that are converting to fat but there are three
fats that you can start consuming in larger
amounts that will help reverse a fatty liver and i'm going to
put some links down below for each one number one olive oil olive oil is an
omega-9 fatty acid it's anti-inflammatory and it's highly
beneficial to support a fatty liver don't worry about the calories
from olive oil or trying to have just a little bit
use a good amount of it there's a lot of other benefits to olive oil and i'll put
a link down below but i would recommend organic and extra
virgin olive oil being the best all right number two fish
oils i'm talking about wild caught fish oils you can also do
cod liver oil rich in omega-3 fish oils inhibit
fat from accumulating on the liver and it can actually help reduce the fat in
your liver as well it's highly anti-inflammatory
it's also good for the retina it's good for the heart and it's
definitely good for your brain so make sure that you start consuming
fish at least two to three times a week but make sure
it's the fatty fish as well and it wouldn't hurt to find a high
quality fish oil or a cod liver oil all right last one is the virgin coconut
oil can help reverse a fatty liver
in rat studies now there's not any human studies
but if you have a pet rat that has a fatty liver
start feeding them some coconut oil make sure it's virgin
now there's some other things you can do to reduce fat on the liver and by the
way having a fatty liver is very very common
one way to know that you have it is just to look down
if you have a gut you have a fatty liver but even if you don't have a gut and
you're doing a high carbohydrate diet the fat is around the organs you can't
quite see them sometimes it's definitely going to be crammed up inside the liver
there's some other things you can do purify bile salts
is a really good remedy for a fatty liver you take
one tablet after a meal number two choline excellent fat soluble
nutrient that can help strip fat off the liver
also cutting your carbs down and i'm talking about sugar
and especially fructose because there's nothing that will fatten up a liver
faster than fructose okay number four fasting what happens when you fast
both intermittently and periodic prolonged fasting
is that you give your body a chance to reduce insulin
and the body will then start to go after fat reserves in your liver and
turn that into ketones so it'll start to tap
in to the fat reserve finally because you're not stimulating
insulin and then the amount of fat will get less and less and less
so fasting is essential if you are really serious about
getting rid of that fat in your liver thanks for watching

so i have a very interesting video on chronic inflammation and anemia now check this out one of
the first line of defense against pathogens in our body is the withholding of nutrition or starvation
from other microbes now iron and a few other trace minerals are required for microbes to grow so in
other words both the good bacteria and the bad pathogens need iron or they require iron to be
able to grow that's one of the foods so i want to introduce you to a word called sequestration
this word describes a condition where your body is binding up for locking up
iron and other trace minerals to prevent pathogens from getting that food
so the free iron that you had in the body is rapidly being bound up by certain compounds so
we have this interesting game between your body and pathogens your body sensing an infection and
inflammation and a fever will quickly lock up that iron to prevent the pathogens from growing
the pathogen has counter strategies to break open your cells and get that iron
both the good and bad bacteria are trying to survive but your body if it's healthy will be
able to do its job and prevent the microbe from growing and this is why when certain people have
too much iron they have a certain condition where they can absolutely not get rid of iron and they
just have too much they're very susceptible to getting infections that's why as a side note
the microorganism and lyme disease has developed a strategy to get its food from not iron but from
manganese so it'll it'll just be like okay you can take your iron i'll take manganese and it'll
survive that way now what's normally supposed to happen is you get this infection or you have this
inflammation so you have this thing going on right here and then you overcome the infection
and the inflammation the fever goes away and now this iron is available now for your cells to use
to grow but what happens when you go into a chronic inflammatory condition okay
as an autoimmune problem whether it's rheumatoid arthritis or whatever you can become very
deficient in iron and become anemic and feel weak in your mind you might say well okay well
i'm just going to take some iron here to feed my body and give it more trace minerals well the
problem is you're going to feed the pathogens at the same time a much better strategy would be to
handle the deeper root cause of the inflammation whether it is a subclinical microbial infection or
just your immune system is out of control and it's attacking your own tissues in which case fasting
is the answer to that regular intermittent fasting with periodic prolonged fasting
if you're new to my channel you definitely need to see those videos i put those down below and
in addition to fasting vitamin d in larger amounts minimally 30 000 ius but probably 40 000 or more
would be necessary to help reduce the inflammation and that would allow your body to make these
trace minerals especially iron more available to your own tissue so you can actually use it
and i thought this was interesting especially to those who have chronic inflammatory conditions
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

so i have some interesting information about alzheimer's
and your hormones check this out and this is all based on a
recent book that i got and i'm going to put a link down below but you never
ever ever see alzheimer's in kids or young people it's always an older
people so if we take a look at one big
difference between the young and the old we have a
hormonal shift we have a significant drop in estrogen
between 35 years old and 50 there's a 35 decrease progesterone really takes a
a dive down 75 between ages 35 and 50.
you also have a decrease in dhea which is a stress hormone and also a
decrease in pregnenolone and a decrease in
growth hormone and a decrease in d3 and d3 is considered a hormone
simply because our skin becomes older and you
just can't absorb vitamin d like you used to
but there is a spike in these two hormones luteinizing
hormone and follicle stimulating hormone see this
after menopause so that's interesting the author of this
book talked about the relationship between
luteinizing hormone okay this one right here and by the way
both of these hormones trigger the gonads the ovaries and the
testicles so it increases estrogen progesterone
and testosterone these are spiked because it's trying to stimulate these
and it's not working so the feedback loop keeps elevating these two hormones
so the author found this relationship between increased luteinizing hormone
and alzheimer's now the author also found in another paper that
cigarette smoking and ibuprofen decreases this hormone
and there's some evidence that it does decrease the risk of alzheimer's now
we're not recommending these two things but that's an
interesting connection if we take a look at the drug lupron
lupron normally is used for endometriosis
fibroids decreasing risk of breast cancer
decreasing risk of prostate cancer but there's also some data that it decreases
the risk of alzheimer's and this is interesting
because normally these things would come from
excess amount of estrogen but apparently the effects that
are created from this drug has more to do with
luteinizing hormone than estrogen so one of the big problems
with lupron is the side effects however there are other natural things
that can also lower luteinizing hormone without
side effects so one being melatonin melatonin is the considered the clock
hormone because it helps regulate sleep it's
stimulated by darkness and it helps you get into a deep sleep it also has a
huge effect over your immune system and it's a
powerful antioxidant but it also can decrease luteinizing
hormone which then can help decrease the risk of
alzheimer's now if you're going to read this book
you're going to find that the main effect between melatonin and
decreasing symptoms of alzheimer's is mainly in women
okay however if you increase the dose of melatonin
higher men than you do in women you can see
some good effects of decreasing the risk of alzheimer's so
i want to give you the protocol then you can read the book and get more details
this is what is recommended if you're a female you'd want to take 75 milligrams
of melatonin now realize that when you buy melatonin
it usually comes in three milligrams okay that's that's very very small so
you can imagine how many pills you'd have to take
so what you'd want to do is gradually work up to this
start with three milligrams for one week then double to six for one week
and then double it to 12 another week and gradually go up to
this amount right here to create this effect now if you're a man the
suggestion is that you would take 120 milligrams of melatonin
at night before you go to sleep the next thing that's recommended is pregnenolone
300 milligrams per day and because in alzheimer's
patients there's a diminished capacity to use glucose as
fuel you want to use ketones for fuel one way
to do it is to take mct oil about three teaspoons
per day spread out and of course i'm gonna always recommend you do
keto as well as fasting okay i'll put some links down below if you're
new to my channel but it's very very important to do that because if we can
increase ketones we can actually activate more of
the brain also it's less damaging than glucose
okay exercise has been shown to create some really good effects
in alzheimer's patients so the combination of all these things together
will create a nice dent into this condition right here
now of course check with your doctor before
applying any of this information this is just for your education and to show you
uh some interesting links between what happens with your hormones
and alzheimer's thanks for watching

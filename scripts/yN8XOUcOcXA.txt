so i get this question quite often do i look at
a nut as more of a protein or a fat well it's a combination and i just want to
create a short video to explain a little bit more about that
we have pecans walnuts almonds macadamia nut
and pistachio if you look at the pecan and the relationship between fat 71
grams to 9 grams of protein you can see
that pecan is way more of a fat than a protein right
but it has some protein in it it actually has some carbs
as well but if we deduct the fiber we get four grams net carbs so that's
pretty low but there is some so when you do a
ketogenic diet a lot of times you don't look at the
carbs and nuts but sometimes they do add up especially if you're going to consume
a lot of pistachios okay 20 grams so it's good to sometimes calculate some
of these macros these macronutrients so pecan is pretty high in fat
it has some protein as well and it's low in carb
let's look at the walnut 52 grams of fat versus 12 grams of protein so
it's more of a fat than a protein but it has both
pretty low on net carbs right plus walnuts have ala which is an
omega-3 fatty acid it's a precursor it's not the active
form but it can turn into the active form of epa and then dha
not that much but it does have some omega-3 now let's go to the almond
we have 73 grams of fat okay that's pretty high
with 29 grams of protein so definitely a lot higher
than these others so far with a 14 gram of net carb
the macadamia nut look at this look how much fat
102 grams versus the protein which is 11 grams
with a net carb of seven grams pretty low
so it's a very high fat low carb some protein which these all fit into
the formula for a keto diet for sure but they have a combination of
fat and protein so far nuts are mostly fat if you look at the whole picture
okay then we have the pistachio 52 grams of fat versus
25 grams of protein so this right here has a good amount of
protein and it has less fat but look at the
carbs 20 grams so if you're trying to lose weight and
you're looking at all the different carbs
you may not want to go crazy on this but if you're trying to gain weight
okay and you want to do keto this might be a good one
to focus on if you want to lose weight the macadamia nut would be really good
personally i like pecans and if you see what's
unique about pecans it's very low on carb
and a real good amount of fat and it's also
some protein and it's not very high in oxalates so it's not going to put you at
risk for kidney stones this one right here is higher in oxlets
so if you're prone to kidney stones you'd probably want to avoid
almonds all right so that's my quick video thanks for watching

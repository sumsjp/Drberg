so recently I had a question from someone on my youtube channel that wanted
to know why their urine is smelling like burnt popcorn so let's just briefly talk
about what that is that is a condition where you're making a lot of ketones now
you're not making so many that you're in ketoacidosis but you're making a good
amount and it's concentrated and this usually happens after you're doing
fasting I would say about between 16 to 18 to 20 hours especially when you wake
up in the morning when your urine is more concentrated your urine could smell
like popcorn now this is not a bad thing it just means that you're in some pretty
hardcore ketosis okay so that means it's working and you can even check your
urine or your blood and you'll notice that now it's a couple things you can do
to modify that you can adjust your protein downward a little bit sometimes
when you're consuming too much protein you're gonna notice a stronger smell but
usually if you're gonna do too much protein it's gonna smell more like
ammonia now ammonia could also be in a UTI but
most of time you just need to adjust the amount of protein bring it down a little
bit and that goes away the other thing you can do is just adjust your fluids
consume more fluid to help dilute that concentration if you want to see my
other video related to the urine and how to identify certain problems based on
the color of your urine I put it up right here check it out

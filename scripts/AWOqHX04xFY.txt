so let's talk about all the different things that can cause shortness of breath okay that's
a condition where you just can't breathe well now there's quite a few reasons for that that
people already know like if you have liver disease kidney disease chronic lung disease
asthma things like that but what i want to focus on are all the other reasons where this symptom
would come from other than the obvious ones number one a vitamin b1 deficiency so many people have a
b1 deficiency it's it's literally an epidemic and a major deficiency of vitamin b1 is called
beriberi and there's two types one is a wet beriberi involving the vascular system and
the blood in the heart and there's a dry version which involves the nervous system so you can have
symptoms in the nervous system as well as in your heart but there's something called a subclinical
beriberi which is i think very very common simply because the amount of refined carbohydrates and
sugars that people eat and i i recently did a video on b1 on all the other reasons why
you might be deficient taking an antibiotic drinking too much coffee or tea or alcohol or
sulfates and i'll put that link down below but if you're deficient in b1 you can have edema
and definitely problems breathing because the heart is not able to pump out blood effectively
there's another condition that occurs when you're b1 deficient and that's called lactic acidosis
that's a situation where your body starts to accumulate lactate and then your ph
drops and you become too acidic you're holding on too much of co2
and that's going to majorly affect your ability to get oxygen and you're going to have
hard times breathing now there's several reasons why someone might have lactic acidosis
number one it's a side effect when you take metformin lactic acidosis is a symptom of diabetes
if you're very deficient in biotin you can also have lactic acidosis if you have liver problems
or kidney problems you can develop that condition if you overdo it on exercise you can also develop
lactic acidosis if you also drink a lot of alcohol you can develop lactic acidosis vitamin b1 is the
remedy for lactic acidosis as well as shortness of breath if you have that condition now your ph can
really affect how you breathe if you're too far on the acid side and you have acidosis you could
have labored deep breathing or something called air hunger where you just can't get enough oxygen
and then if you're too alkaline as an alkalosis you can also have breathing problems as well as
well as muscle issues like cramping tetany where you've got these little twitching things in your
muscles muscle cramps in your lower legs because the minerals like calcium can't be mobilized in
the body and high levels of cortisol and stress can cause you to become too alkaline being on a
high carb diet can cause severe alkalosis and a potassium deficiency can also cause
alkalosis as well as consuming too much calcium if you have too much calcium in your blood
your ph is going to become more alkaline because calcium is more alkaline so just
by the symptom of shortness of breath you can't really tell if you're too alkaline or too acid
you're going to have to know the other symptoms that are associated with
either ph problem i did put a video down below if you want more information on that topic now
if you're low in calcium in the blood you can also have difficulty in breathing as well and of course
if you have asthma you have difficulty breathing too and by the way vitamin d is really important
in helping you breathe if you have asthma pneumonia you're going to have problems breathing
zinc is the remedy for that and then copd i did a more extensive video on copd that involves
a chronic lung inflammatory condition vitamin c is vital as well as vitamin e
in reducing inflammation and inhibiting the formation of fibrosis in your lung all right guys
there's my summary on all the potential causes of shortness of breath before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by
to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

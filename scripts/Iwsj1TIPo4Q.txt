so here's a question for you what are the best berries when you're on the ketogenic
diet let's go through this berries are definitely loaded with all sorts of phytonutrients
there's certain pigments one called anthocyanin which give these berries the red purple or blue
color so berries have this urge to survive so they are very attractive they're different colors
they're very delicious they're very sweet and that way animals can eat them and spread their seeds
and the phytonutrient pigments have some really interesting health properties or antioxidants
they help your blood sugars they are high in fiber they also reduce inflammation which buffers the
glycemic index they're also high in vitamin c and other nutrients but let's go through this
strawberries 8.1 grams of net carbs per cup and about 7 grams of sugar then we get blueberries
17.4 grams that's net carbs and 15 grams of sugar pretty high so you want to make sure that you're
consuming only a small amount when you consume them but check this out when you get dried berries
crazy amount of net carbs per cup it's a 132 grams of net carbs with 80 grams of sugar okay so
these are not keto friendly you'd have to do the actual fresh berry or frozen berry then we get to
the blackberry which has only six grams net carbs and seven grams of sugar and then we get raspberry
seven gram of net carb and five gram of sugar so blackberry would be the best berry and then
raspberry if you're going to do blueberries don't do too much and definitely you need to
stay away from those dried blueberries hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

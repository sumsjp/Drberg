in this video I'm going to show you how to target cellulite on your hips and
thighs most people spend hours at the gym doing exercises to try to tone those
areas and without any results it's extremely frustrating and that is
because of this one simple fact it's not the fat that jiggly stuff on your hips
and thighs is actually not fat now it's one of two things number one it's a
lymph situation where there's a lack of lymph drainage the lymph nodes that you
have are it's like an extra circulation to the body that have there's like these
little nodes that accumulate through your neck you've lymph nodes through
here for the immune system you have them through the abdomen you
have them on the thighs are all over the place and they can create a lot of
inflammation and soreness when you press in them so a lot of women that have a
stagnant lymph situation in that area it looks just like cheese it's like a kind
of a jiggly type fluid retentive thing now I study a lot about planting and
growing vegetables and things like that and I ran across this book by this
farmer slash physiologist slash chemist he wrote this book in 1932 and he's
talking about corn growing corn and having corn having a huge problem with
the corns a drainage system or the lymphatic system in the corn stalks and
having all these diseases with the lymphatic system of a plant and
vegetable so I was like wow that's interesting what is it what's causing
that and then he goes on to talk about if there's no potassium in the soil the
the plants drainage system becomes blocked it becomes a problem and like
that's interesting so I took that information and I wonder if it was the
same in our human bodies that if you were to consume more potassium I wonder
if that would push them the fluid out well guess what
sodium and potassium work as a kind of an alternative opposite effect so if you
high in sodium retain fluid right if you're high in potassium you can get rid
of the fluid retention so then I looked at potassium and I want to know how much
potassium our body is needed and I found out the daily recommendation is 4700
milligrams that's crazy that's how a lot of
potassium that's what our bodies need every single day so then I compared what
people consume per day and I found it was something like a real small like
less than a thousand and you might say well I eat bananas right bananas have
300 milligrams of potassium well guess what you need 4700 you'd have to have 12
bananas a day so right there that told me that hardly anyone is getting enough
potassium and if you have lymphedema or swelling or edema or fluid in your lymph
and you're not getting potassium no wonder it's not working so a real big
tip would be to start to spike up your vegetable content to get enough
potassium to push some of this fluid out because it happens in plants why
wouldn't it happen our own body potassium is a real hard mineral to get
to so you would have to consume about 7 up to 9 possibly 10 depending on your
size cups of vegetable to get your potassium so here's what I recommend
take a blender put some kale in there put some spinach in there be tops by the
way have the most potassium out of anything on the planet yeah those little
those little green things off the beet beet tops and you cut those off and you
put those in the blender and you start blending you don't juice it you blend it
put a little bit of berry in there may be blueberry may be strawberry blend it
up with water drink one of those a day like fill it up here and then drink half
and then drink another half the other part of the day maybe add some avocados
so there start increasing more potassium to your diet if that your problem is
lymphatic water retention and then that problem will go right away so that's one
step right there so try that the other cause of cellulite usually
happens when you get in your 40s and your 50s when you get close to menopause
and the reason for that is your adrenal glands which are little glands on top of
the kidney there's stress glands they're the backup organ to the ovaries and so
at age 52 or even before that the ovaries stop working they start stopped
laying or releasing eggs the adrenal gland because they make the same hormones
start having to do more work and they start backing up the ovary if they're
stressed out going into menopause that's when you have a lot of problems with
weight gain after menopause hot flashes and etc but if there's a problem with
adrenal during that period of time one of the symptoms is atrophy atrophy what
is atrophy atrophy is a shrinkage of your own lean body mass at your muscles
your muscles break down your muscles turn into mush they don't get the it's
hard to tone them so you can have either that side light could be a fluid
situation or it can be an atrophy situation where you have loss of muscle
not because you know eating proteins or exercising simply because hormonally
it's very destructive on your protein so what do you do for that situation you
would want to strengthen the adrenals find something that targets and
strengthens these adrenals and improve them and part of that is sleeping and
doing the right exercise and aligning your lifestyle with it with the support
of the adrenal but there but this is what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to
say instead of just trying to burn off this so-called fat on your hips why
don't you just fix the adrenal it's a lot easier okay
so those are the two underlying reasons for cellulite and I want you to you know
apply some of the stuff I just showed you and let me know how it works
okay I hope that helped I'll see you in the next video

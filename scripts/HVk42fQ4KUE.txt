I want to talk about the fasting effects on a diabetic's eye now just to be
transparent this study that I'm basing this on was done on mice so if
you actually do have some pet mice that need better vision because they're
diabetic you could apply this this is what they found there was a protective
effect on the retina and other nerves the retina is nerve tissue it's
basically your brain extending in your eye socket this is what they found this
is actually quite interesting fasting improves the microbiome the microbiome
are your friendly bacteria it causes these microbes to modify change bile
acids or bile salts to this specific compound right here which then gives
protection to your nerves so if you're diabetic you're gonna have problems with
the vascular supply the capillaries to the nerves the nerves are gonna start to
die off slowly and the fingertips and the toes and the eyes and the kidney and
so this compound counters the damage to the nerve not just in the eye but other
nerves as well now that would make sense because what's causing this problem
originally is the high level of sugar that a diabetic is living with okay so
sugar is very corrosive it kind of rusts out the nervous system inside the body
it destroys it so you're basically not eating so you're
gonna eliminate this as well as drop and normalize your insulin levels but what's
even more fascinating about this is that when you fast your microbes actually
improve it's fascinating they start to increase the resistance to
oxidative stress they start to diversify they actually build up their community
they become stronger you would think if you starve them they would die off faster
no they live longer okay because there are certain genes that kick in
that our survival genes and obviously they've been coping with
starvation for a very very long time because they were here before us they
also found that they can tolerate pathogens better so if you want to make
your microbes stronger and get all the benefits from producing certain type of
byproducts that help your blood sugars and improve your insulin resistance to
having the microbes make more vitamins to have more immune protection
definitely include fasting with your healthy keto plan if you're new to my
channel I put a link down below of exactly how to do it thanks for watching

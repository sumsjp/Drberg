today I want to talk about the relationship between potassium and
insulin it's very interesting especially if you are a diabetic or have insulin
resistance so insulin is a hormone that causes you to store fat in the presence
of insulin it's almost impossible to burn fat in this way because insulin
prevents the fat burning so it's all about storing sugar as fat and it's
preventing the oxidation or breakdown of fat insulin also stores glucose so let's
say for example you ate some sugar or some refined carbs now the body is going
to store that as storage sugar insulin turns glucose into glycogen so this is
what glycogen looks like it's a string of glucose molecules held together and
stored sugar and you also have potassium involved as well so a potassium is
necessary in the storage of glycogen so the main purpose of insulin is to lower
your blood sugar and it does that through taking the sugar and putting
into storage as glycogen or as fat and if you're diabetic and you take
medication to lower your blood sugar the question is so where's it going it's
being hidden as fat it's not evaporating so basically these medications are
taking out of the blood and putting it somewhere else
now insulin also helps put the potassium in your cells so that's one of the
purposes when you consume a high glucose diet or a high carb diet you deplete
potassium from the inside of the cell so you lose potassium so if you consume a
lot of carbohydrates at one time you're gonna show potassium deficiency symptoms
like your pulse rate will start going up you'll have a hard time sleeping your
blood pressure might go up you may feel palpitations in your heart or heart
arrhythmia type symptoms taking potassium makes insulin less resistive
as well so it's really good to improve insulin resistance and if you're
diabetic you have insulin resistance and this is
why all diabetics should be making sure they get enough potassium and more to
help their blood Sugar's and improve the normalization of insulin if you're
deficient in potassium that's going to impair glucose and even increase the
risk for instant resistance just by having a deficiency of potassium and
then you're being put on the medication like a diuretic which then can deplete
potassium and cause more high blood pressure and also if you have instant
resistance and you're diabetic you take metformin and one of the problems in the
form and it depletes potassium so my point about this video is if you're a
diabetic make sure you have enough potassium and I created a very important
video on diabetes a long time ago and I put it on this page right here check it out

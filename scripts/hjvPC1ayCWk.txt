so today i want to talk about seven very odd or weird b1 deficiency symptoms
i've done a lot of videos on b1 it's probably one of the most important
vitamins if you're deficient typically you're going to feel anxious you're going to feel
nervous you're going to have stress but there's some real interesting additional symptoms that
you need to be aware of that's connected to b1 thiamine first one is raynaud's phenomena or
syndrome what is raynaud's phenomena that's a situation where your fingertips turn literally
blue when you actually get exposed to cold so what's behind that is a b1 deficiency
if you don't have enough b1 your autonomic nervous system does not work right it doesn't adapt
to stress gravity stress and even temperature stress so the venous blood tends to accumulate
in the ends of your fingertips when you have this condition so it's a b1 deficiency number
two morning sickness that would be the feeling of nauseousness or you want to even vomit that's a b1
deficiency as well now there's a sub symptom of morning sickness which is a hypersensitivity to
certain types of odors so if a woman is pregnant and she just cannot stand to be in a certain room
because of a certain odor because it's like overbearing that is a b1 deficiency as well
next one is increased pulse rate or heart rate that is a b1 deficiency and then you have edema
swelling in the ankles a lot of times people associate that with sodium retention or fluid
retention but it could be a b1 deficiency because when you get a b1 deficiency you have what's
called a subclinical beriberi and there's a wet beriberi which involves a cardiovascular system
in dry beriberi which involves the nervous system this one is under the category of a
wet beriberi which is a cardiovascular problem which you'll get edema number five psychosis
could be a b1 deficiency now this person who is psychotic ha is completely disconnected from
reality they're not saying they're not rational they're not reasonable and i'm sure you've never
run into anyone like that all right next one number six shortness of breath your breathing air
hunger especially at night is a b1 deficiency and last one is you're dizzy from going from a seated
position or when you're lying down to standing up if you stand up and you feel disoriented or dizzy
that's a b1 deficiency because the b1 deficiency has everything to do with the failure to adapting
to stress gravity you name it so if you have any of these odd symptoms you need to be taking

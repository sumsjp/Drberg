let's talk about fibrocystic breast disease what's behind that first of all what is it
it's a hyperplasia it's an excessive amount of tissue that's developing fibrous tissue
in certain parts of the breast it could potentially be a pre-cancerous
this problem is an iodine deficiency because iodine protects the body tissues against excessive
amounts of estrogen especially in the breast iodine mostly concentrates in your thyroid but
30 of your iodine reserves are concentrated in the breast tissue the eyes the stomach the cervix
and the salivary glands now what foods have iodine sea kelp okay seaweed which by the way is sea kelp
but there's other types of seaweed in addition to sea kelp you have salt water fish shellfish
egg yolks have iodine and it just so happens that in japan where they consume a lot of sea kelp and
seaweed they have the lowest breast cancer mortality rates i mean check this out we have 6.6
out of a hundred thousand people versus the u.s which has a breast cancer mortality rate of 27.7
for every 100 000 women so it appears that iodine is very protective against
breast cancer now there's a study that i'm going to put down below that you can check out estrogen
treated mice with an iodine deficiency develop cysts and by supplementing them with iodine there
is a 77.7 percent beneficial effect so if your pet mice develop fibrocystic breast disease make sure
that you feed them iodine because you wouldn't want them to develop a problem with that

so why is it that the country of Saudi Arabia which has so much sun exposure
have such a vitamin D problem there is a meta-analysis between 2008 and 2015 that
demonstrated a 63.5% of the population having a vitamin D deficiency okay
that is crazy high but not only that there was a nineteen point nine percent
of the population had a vitamin D insufficiency which is not a full
deficiency but they had like a subclinical vitamin D deficiency and if
we add those two numbers together we get eighty three point four percent of the
population has a big problem with vitamin D this is epidemic their seventh
in the world for the rate of getting diabetes and I'm talking about type 2
their fourth in the world at the rate of getting type one diabetes which is an
autoimmune disease and by the way 84 percent of type one diabetes in children
showed a vitamin D deficiency there's a huge connection now why are they
deficient vitamin D well the obvious thing is they have traditional clothing
that blocks the Sun and there probably has some other reasons too because once
you get diabetes you're even more deficient and there's
other factors too like obesity and the amount of fat on your body that's gonna
slow things down the amount of pigment in your skin you have age your digestion
so there's many many factors now what you have to realize is that only 10% of
the vitamin D in your body comes from your diet it's almost impossible to get
all of your vitamin D from your diet but just realize that fatty fish cod liver
oil have a lot of vitamin D now when you're deficient in vitamin D you're gonna
have fatigue you can get depressed it increases your risk for getting diabetes
as well as a lot of inflammation especially
in the lower back you get aches and pains bone pain if you press uh near
your sternum okay which is your breastbone and you have pain or your
shin which is in the front part of your lower leg and it hurts that could be
because of the vitamin D deficiency high blood pressure is a vitamin D deficiency
a weakened immune system so there are many problems that occur when you're
deficient in vitamin D so if you live in Saudi Arabia and you're watching this
video I highly recommend you start taking at least 15,000 to 20,000 IU's of
vitamin d3 every single day I would also recommend to go along with that is to
take vitamin k2 and for every 10,000 IU's of d3 you want a hundred micrograms
of k2 and that's the ratio so you can do your own calculations on that but I
think if you start taking vitamin D I think you're going to notice a huge
improvement in these symptoms as well as a major reduction in not only diabetes
type 2 but type 1 as well alright thanks for watching hey we're back with another amazing

now you probably already know this i'm just reminding you but today we're going to talk
about the amazing benefit music's effect on the body it is profound what music can do for
your overall mood for your emotions and if your emotions are higher you can have huge influences
over the entire body in fact music affects you at the cellular level it affects your dna
your rna your expression of your genes whether certain genes are turned on or turned off
so let's go through this it's a major therapy for many things and there's slightly less side effects
than medication and i'm being very sarcastic because there are zero side effects using
music as a therapy so the first thing that i found out about when i was doing research
on this and i'm going to put the links down below is that music stimulates neurogenesis
it means that it stimulates the growth of your neurons your nerve cells and your brain cells
go figure number two it stimulates the release of neurotransmitters now what are neurotransmitters
they're the actual communication or signal between neurons and so you have this increase
in neurotransmitters number three it increases synapse formation now what is a synapse
a synapse is the machine or mechanism that allows the communication to occur to get from one point
to another it would be compared to a phone system or an internet system it's kind of a
space between the two neurons which allow the communication to go from one point to the next
so music actually helps you grow the things that send them communication it improves the
communication itself and the machine that allows the whole communication to occur
which is fascinating so i guess you could say that music increases communication in the body
and anytime you increase communication you increase healing in the body alright number four
music affects the cortisol receptors so it can help counter anxiety stress and worry number five
music greatly influences the endocrine system and this is why when someone goes through a sadness or
a loss or depression music can just uplift them because it can raise the person on the emotional
scale from a lower emotion to a much higher emotion which then starts affecting the physiology
because your emotions are the controlling factor of what happens in your body so anything that
brings you up on the scale without being a chemical or a drug would be very very um
therapeutic and i'm talking about things that are on the aesthetic band like music
art dancing things like that music can greatly increase your energy can increase your exercise
endurance i just did a video on that music is used as a therapy for people that are in chronic
and acute pain as well as people who have a lot of inflammation music is even used in recovery of
having a stroke or even a heart attack in fact they've done studies on helping animals repair
using music so music doesn't just affect us it affects animals as well and lastly music can
greatly improve your personal production it can help you become more creative it can help you
be more motivated to help reach your goals it can help improve your happiness level
overcome problems easier and it can definitely help you think more positive now go ahead and

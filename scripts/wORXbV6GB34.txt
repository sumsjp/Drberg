you know when i was in practice for 30
years
i would say nearly a hundred percent
of every single person who could not
sleep especially the ones that had
chronic sleeping issues always had
gut issues
either they had
irritable bowel syndrome or celiac or
crohn's or diverticulitis or heartburn
or bloating or indigestion something was
going on in the stomach and this is
probably why when people take probiotics
before bed they sleep
better so today i'm going to talk about
the link between your digestion and your
sleeping and give you some tips on how
to improve your sleeping i've done a lot
of videos on sleeping especially
related to
light
and how that affects the circadian
rhythms how it can either stimulate or
inhibit sleep depending on how much
fluorescent light or led light that
you're exposed to so if you haven't seen
that video that would be also very
important i'll put that link down below
but you have this um clock in your brain
the suprachiasmic nuclei or you might
want to pronounce it super chasmic i'm
not even sure how do you pronounce it
exactly but there's a clock in your
brain that regulates uh your sleep
patterns
and that clock uses
as its main hormone something called
melatonin and so the question is how do
you get enough melatonin to make this
clock work correctly should you just
take it as a supplement and i don't
recommend that because anytime you take
a hormone you really are treating the
symptom you're not getting rid of the
cause and i want to know what's really
underneath the deficiency of melatonin
also when you take hormones you
inactivate the gland that makes them so
there's several ways that melatonin is
created melatonin comes from another
hormone called serotonin and ninety
percent of all the serotonin in your
body
is made with help from your friendly
bacteria so these microbes help you in
so many different ways
they actually take
tryptophan which is amino acid
and they convert that to
serotonin
and this is probably why
people take l-tryptophan as a supplement
to help them sleep and the reason it
does help you because it converts to
serotonin which then converts to
melatonin now if you ever take
tryptophan to help you sleep
always take it on an empty stomach
because if you take it with food protein
from that food will block
the absorption of tryptophan so you want
to take it on an empty stomach and yes
it does work pretty good now tryptophan
also works for anxiety as well and
what's fascinating is that it was used
long ago i don't know 20 plus years ago
for um
depression and i mean so many people
were using it and all of a sudden there
was this contamination i think if i'm
not mistaken in china or japan and this
created a scare where
the fda took it off the market
and coincidentally a new remedy the next
week
came into being
for depression and anxiety and that was
prozac i just find that a very
interesting coincidence right but what i
think that's even more of a coincidence
is that
tryptophan came back on the market
if i'm not mistaken it was allowed back
on the market
right when the patents ran out for
prozac i could be wrong but i could be
right on that so we have tryptophan that
turns into serotonin it turns into
melatonin with the help of your microbes
and this is why one of the side effects
from taking an antibiotic produces
insomnia your sleep is disturbed
now to make tryptophan work you also
need vitamin b6
if someone is deficient in b6 the
conversion of tryptophan to serotonin
just won't occur and this is why
people that have a b6 deficiency also
have insomnia so i'm just kind of giving
you the pathway of what can occur
and the great importance
of your microbiome which is collectively
all the friendly bacteria and the
friendly yeast
and friendly other organisms that
help you in fact the microbiome is
considered another organ that you have
you're dependent on it you cannot live
without it you're not going to be able
to sleep without your microbes and so if
you have sleeping problems this is
another
important focus focus on your gut
microbiome and do things to improve in
fact you might want to take a probiotic
you might want to watch my video on
taking kefir before bed or at least
later in the day to help you sleep
because it's a great remedy but you can
also use kimchi or sauerkraut and that
can help you now these microbes also
consume fiber and i also personally find
that
if i don't consume
like a salad my sleep isn't as good so i
do find that fiber from
salad does help me sleep other people
with gut issues might find that fiber
not helpful they would probably sleep
better without it but if you don't have
a gut issue
it might help you because also the
vegetables have the potassium and
magnesium
that does help sleep the other really
important
thing i want to mention
uh in this video is that
if you are doing fasting okay
in the past i'd recommend certain
patterns of fasting let's say you're
going to do
i don't know eighteen and six you're
gonna fast for 18 hours and you're gonna
your eating window is six hours
but the time of when you eat can greatly
affect your sleep as well there's some
new information which i've done a video
on which i will put down below
that basically states that if you
shift your eating window to earlier in
the day which supposes what i've been
recommending but you might want to try
it out so you would eat in the morning
eat your breakfast and then have your
second meal if you do a second meal
no later than three o'clock p.m
you may find that your sleeping is much
better because there are certain food
genes that are normally downgraded so if
you upgrade them with food you're
stimulating certain genes that can
actually make you more awake
so this late night grazing is terrible
for sleeping
eating too late might be not good for
sleeping so you might want to try having
your last meal no later than three
in the afternoon okay and don't worry
about quantity have a good meal if you
do omad just make sure it doesn't go
past 3 p.m and that may greatly help
your sleeping now if you haven't seen my
video on connecting
your sleep cycle to light in darkness
you should check that out i put it up
right here

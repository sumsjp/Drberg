how many of you ever had a tailbone
injury okay let's have you come up this
is a different injury when you fall in
the tailbone the force travels up the
spine and gets stuck in the back of the
neck right here okay in fact when I
landed I was holding my neck and they
thought that I had injured I hit my he
wow it was on a concrete floor gu pulled
a chair
[Music]
out okay so let me just just um let me
just wear these so I can see what I'm
going to do now is your tailbone hurt
does your back hurt my neck your neck
hurts more now today normally everything
hurts but okay this normally will get
rid of back pain from a fall on the
tailbone so what we're going to do is
we're going to release the stress that's
stuck up here between the skull and the
first bone the skull bone is called the
oxy put it's a new word oxy put back of
the skull so you got all these muscles
back here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my thumb and just
stretch stretch the oxop put to the
first bone and again we're going to
we'll do this in the next section but
I'm just going to do it to show you
something so see how I kind of just
stretch I'm like lifting her head up
this one's hard to do on
yourself yeah
now the most important part of this is
making sure that you don't mess up her
hair I was going to say that so I'm
really cautious about
that yeah this
thing Nots like there's no motion it's
like stuck
there so I have to really stretch I'm
taking the head like a bowling ball and
um
bringing it up this
way the right side is fine the left side
is
frozen so I have to kind of these
ligaments here are like Saran Wrap so we
have to stretch it right I was going to
say could you really feel the nuts yeah
yeah you can really feel these
knuts this injury was in 1986
yes so the longer it takes the you
know it might take a couple visits to do
this are you pressing very much with the
hand that's on our neck the back of our
neck are you pressing I'm like I'm like
right underneath the skull and I'm
raising I'm trying to stretch that
thing manipulating it I'm stretching
it okay so now did that that give you
any
relief yes okay now in your skull you
have
joints it's called sutures they're on
the top guess where the force also is
stuck on the suture on the top of the
skull so I'm going to take my
thumb and go forward remember it's going
to hurt on the opposite side of the butt
bone so the top of the head and I'm
going to go forward and I'm just taking
my thumb and inching slowly
forward without messing up her hair this
should be a little tender
too is that Tender Is it a good tender
or is it a bad tender a good tender okay
yeah I can feel there's like a ridge
like a volcano right
here is that why I blow up every now and
then no
oh right
here yeah I'm getting hot just working
on this because it's the Heat's just
coming right off are you calling me a
pad no no
and go all the way to the front and I'm
pressing down on the
suture okay so how does that feel oh my
my head feels lighter awesome thanks for

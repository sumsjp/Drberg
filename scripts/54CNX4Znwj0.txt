I'm back with some real interesting information there's a very common keto
friendly ingredient that could be stopping your weight loss
we know that keto is low carb right we know that you need to cut out the sugars
we know we need to cut out the grains but we're going to talk about green oils
or specifically seed oils and a nice way of saying it would be vegetable oils
which is really not vegetable oil because you're not taking the oil from
the vegetable you're taking it from the seed of the plant okay that's a lot
different what's the problem the problem is omega-6 fats okay highly inflammatory
it triggers insulin resistance just as bad as sugar or refined grains I mean if
you even look at the past from 1970 to present we had an increase of sugar but
we had a much more massive spike of vegetable oils not to mention the soy
oil the cottonseed oil canola oil and corn oil are all GMO so that's a
compounded effect that I don't want to get into at this point but we also have
safflower oil and sunflower oil almond flour and peanut butter are all higher
in omega-6 now I'm not saying you can't have some
of these but you want to balance it out with your omega-3 an average person in
America has 15 times more omega-6 than omega-3 and they're consuming 45 grams
of omega-6 fats every single day that's ten point eight teaspoons of that oil
that is crazy too high here's another problem that goes beyond
the inflammation and insulin resistance the half-life for some of these oils are
between six hundred and six hundred eighty days in other words they're not
used as fuel they get stuck in the body and the cell membranes they clog up the
liver they clog up the brain even some of these foods are not ketogenic
some are these are the top sources omega-6 fats number one chicken and you
realize that chicken has very high levels of omega-6 fatty acids number two
would be grain deserts of course if you're in Quito you're not going to be
doing that but that's very high in omega-6 salad dressings this is one that
you may be doing and not even knowing it's very high in omega-6 and even
though there might not be any sugar in it it's inflammatory and it can cause
and send resistance what about chips potato chips corn chips
they're using these these oils right here right omega 6 fatty acids nuts and
seeds are mainly omega-6 fatty acids now I'm not saying you can't do nuts or
seeds I'm just saying you have to balance this out with the omega-3 fatty
acids pizza of course that's omega-6 breads fries because you're going to be
using one of these oils right here and of course pasta the definition of keto
is low carb it doesn't really emphasize the type of fat that you should be
putting in your body you'll be much healthier if you focus on cooking with
the coconut oil the butter and the especially the olive oil and the avocado
oil if you're plateauing with keto you may be consuming too many of these oils
right here or you're using too much almond flour some people on keto get
inflamed when they consume almond flour that could come from either the oxalates
or the omega-6 they get inflammation when they do too much peanut butter with
these two I just recommend use these in moderation you can even use some of
these but you're gonna have to offset it with more omega-3 fatty acids it's kind
of debatable as far as the exact ratio you need but if you're gonna do maybe a
three to one or even like a 1 to 1 ratio for awhile till you get things balanced
out that might be a good idea so what has more omega-3 fatty acids fish column
oil fed beef and other animal products
walnuts and chia seed and Brussels sprouts and other vegetables to have a
precursor to omega-3 it's a la this is just so the reason why you need to do
the healthy version of keto if you're new to my channel I put a link down
below but definitely do not put these in your body limit these two right here and
possibly reduce these right here if you have a problem with inflammation or
maybe you just plateaued and you want to speed up the weight loss if you haven't
seen my other video on plateau I'm gonna put it up right here check it out

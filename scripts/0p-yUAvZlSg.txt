let's talk about some natural remedies for liver
fibrosis typically what happens in the stage of liver disease is you
first get either inflammation or a fatty liver and then
that inflammation over time becomes chronic
and causes a lot of damage in the liver cells
and then the liver cells start to heal with scar tissue
that's called fibrosis and then over time
that develops in the cirrhosis so cirrhosis is an advanced
form of fibrosis in the liver now that could come from an infection
from a virus and believe it or not the virus is not
actually creating the damage it's your own immune system that's
creating the damage in the attempts to kill off the virus
alcohol will do it drugs medications toxins parasites fructose
sugar junk food refined carbohydrates and too much iron can increase
inflammation and then lead to fibrosis fibrosis comes from chronic inflammation
your body is trying to replace the healthy normal tissue with scar tissue
or collagen your symptoms are going to be
tired weak itchiness you could potentially
have ascites where your liver is leaking fluid into a sac around
the gut that's a very advanced form of cirrhosis
and if you're male you can start to develop excess amounts of breast tissue
because you're not able to get rid of estrogen anymore and then your skin
becomes very very thin you lose body hair and your voice
starts becoming higher also you can develop hypogonadism
because your testosterone is low because the estrogen is high
and portal hypertension here the remedies
that have the potential to help you and i put the links down below
of some quite amazing studies that show significant improvement
by using these natural remedies this one is from china
i'm not going to even begin to pronounce this i'm just going to say it's an
F Z H Y combination of herbs that have been shown to effectively
reduce the side effects from fibrosis and
definitely inflammation now this product right here tud
is actually a type of purified bile salts
but it's actually made synthetically it's been around for a
long time as far as a remedy but it's very very good to allow bile to flow
through the liver and out to the gallbladder and it's been shown to
decrease the progression of cirrhosis and
fibrosis you would want to take this on an empty
stomach maybe once in the mid-morning and then once
in the late afternoon and then you have another one called
golden thread copis this is a natural herb
it's been shown to help the gallbladder in the liver and reduce the rate of the
liver developing cirrhosis curcumin is another powerful
anti-inflammatory to help decrease the risk of getting fibrosis
and of course keto and intermittent fasting very very important
especially allowing your body to do prolonged fasting
to get into a state of autophagy where your body can then start
repairing some of these damaged proteins because
fibrosis is a type of protein it's a type of collagen
matrix that plugs up and causes the liver to become dysfunctional
and if you haven't seen my videos on a fatty liver you want to check those out

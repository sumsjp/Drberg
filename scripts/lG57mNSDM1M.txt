hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about vitamin D deficiency okay
now vitamin D is mainly there to help you absorb calcium in the small intestine the vitamin D
helps absorb calcium by 20 times that's a lot if you didn't have vitamin D you're not going
to absorb calcium that much so it brings it from the intestine up into the blood okay it also helps
lower blood pressure so some people that are deficient have high blood pressure because of
low vitamin D it also affects the immune system so if you have an immune deficiencies or autoimmune
problems vitamin D can actually help that in fact some of the microbes in certain diseases are very
stealth and they block the receptor for vitamin D to cause you now to pull that thing in there to
perpetuate the illness it's really interesting also prevents asthma so if you have if you're
asthmatic and you go out in the Sun and you get all the Sun you will actually reduce your symptoms
greatly so vitamin D deficiencies can set you up for as asthma symptoms if you're taking bottom in
D like 2,000 milligrams is not going to or 2,000 international units isn't going to do anything
you need minimally ten thousand international units now if you notice I'm not saying milligrams
international units are units that are a lot different rating systems so you need a lot more
to equal milligrams so I I probably like if you're out in the Sun for 20 minutes you're going to get
30 to 40 about 30 to 35 thousand international units of vitamin D so I mean the Sun will give you that
so you want to be you don't be concerned about taking too much vitamin D I mean you could take
like a hundred thousand and still be okay but the danger is not counteracting with vitamin
k2 I put some links down below if you don't know about vitamin k2 to get more data but vitamin k2
works with vitamin d3 and together to transport calcium through the body so what happens vitamin
k2 will take that calcium from the blood and push it into the bone so it actually helps it
works with the vitamin D in the transportation of calcium so you don't end up with soft tissue
calcium or calcification the arteries get the mk7 version that's a natural and then without vitamin
d you get bone pain okay and then also vitamin D is really good to prevent depression so those
especially that's why in the winter people kind of get the blues so let's just talk about what
causes vitamin D deficiencies number one gall bladder if you don't have a gall bladder then
you're not going to have the bile to emulsify and pull in the fat soluble vitamin vitamin D or even
k2 so that could be a problem and if you don't have a gall bladder gall bladder problems then
you need to take something some bio extract to help you and then cortisol so in this book frank
neder encyclopedia of endocrinology volume 4 talks about cortisol counteracting vitamin D so that's
interesting so stress can block vitamin D so here you are getting the Sun taking the vitamins but
it still shows low could be cortisol could be high levels of cortisol that's stress that can
block it and that's why adrenal cases have a lot of issues with calcium because they have
a vitamin D deficiency so it also could be like it's in the winter you don't get much Sun that
could be a cause in which case you want to take some extra virgin cod liver oil which is the best
source of vitamin D and then it could be from your diet you don't consume enough foods with vitamin
D so anyway I just wanted to create a little video to give you a little summary of vitamin
D and tell you some of the other connections that you might not be aware of so thanks for watching

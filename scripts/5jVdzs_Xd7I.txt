let's talk about gastritis inflammation of your stomach now the symptoms of gastritis
which should be indigestion vomiting especially a fluid that's yellow and green
which is actually bile i'm going to come back to that another symptom would be nausea low appetite
abdominal pain especially in the upper part burning especially at night and between
meals now normally when you have acidity acid reflux or heartburn
i would recommend taking either betaine hydrochloride which is an acidifier or apple
cider vinegar but not if you have gastritis this is different and with gastritis we have
inflammation of the stomach so if you're going to add more acid you're going to make it worse so one
simple way to determine if you have gastritis is just to take some acid apple cider vinegar retain
hydrochloride and see if you get worse and if you get worse you either have gastritis or an ulcer
if you get better then we know that it was a lack of acid that was causing this in the first place
and usually the ph of the stomach or the concentration of acid will control the closing
of the valve on the top of the stomach so if you don't have enough acid or the ph is too alkaline
the top of the valve doesn't close that well and so the acid can kind of regurgitate
as in acid reflux or gerd but there's this other condition of gastritis that i want to talk about
which is different now normally when you go to the doctor the way they treat gastritis is with
an antacid which treats the symptom but what about the underlying actual cause is that ever addressed
i don't know so here are several things that cause gastritis alcohol aspirin nsaids h pylori can be
associated with gastritis but also there's two other things that i want to focus on one
is cortisol okay and the other is bile let's first talk about cortisol cortisol is activated
by stress so cortisol increases gastric acids even when there's no food in your stomach this cortisol
can then cause gastric erosion because it can decrease the mucosal layer the mucous
lining that protects the stomach so if you start wearing down that
layer you're going to get inflammation and if it's eventually wore out you can get an ulcer
and this is why stress can cause ulcers there are two ulcers i want to talk about one is called
curling ulcers by a certain doctor's name because he discovered it but that's really
another name for a stress ulcer and i think there's two mechanisms going on there's one where
cortisol actually destroys the lining of the stomach and number two cortisol depletes zinc
which then also causes a lack of healing which then also can cause an ulcer i've done a video on
that i'll put that link down below then you have cushing ulcer and i'm almost positive that that
relates to cushing's syndrome which is an excess amount of cortisol and in this type of ulcer you
have an over stimulation of the vagus nerve which then increases gastric acid which can then cause
an ulcer but what you should know is cortisol in general coming from some stress emotional
stress or whatever can create this gastritis and eventually an ulcer cortisol in general is
supposed to be an anti-inflammatory so how could increasing more cortisol cause more inflammation
well i think it's a similar mechanism to insulin when you increase insulin it becomes dysfunctional
you get insulin resistance and then it doesn't work anymore probably the same thing that's
going on with cortisol high levels of cortisol makes cortisol less effective so now instead
of acting as an anti-inflammatory you get more inflammation and this is why if you study a very
high level of cortisol as in cushing's syndrome we have all sorts of inflammatory conditions
listed as well as a condition with low cortisol addison's you see the same thing you have a
lot of inflammation going in the body now cortisol also affects the immune system an
increase of cortisol creates a suppression of white blood cells so if you don't have
white blood cells working you're going to get a lack of immune protection and you're going
to get a lack of repair probably because you don't have the inflammation there to help in the healing
process now let's come back to another cause that i mentioned bile if there's bile regurgitating
up into the stomach as in bile reflux gastritis you're going to get burning in the stomach
bile is a detergent and it can irritate the stomach lining it can irritate the liver so
if there's any type of backup and bile you're going to have inflammation and so this usually
comes from an obstruction in the bile ducts and the simple remedy is to use a bile salt the one
i'm going to recommend is tutca you take some tut cup maybe two in the morning on an empty stomach
two in the afternoon an empty stomach and that will start increasing the flow of bile and
lessening the reflux of bile into the stomach it's very difficult to differentiate between
gerd and this bile reflux where you have bile coming up through the esophagus because if you
expose the esophagus to bile or acid it creates a similar effect but if you take tupca and you feel
better then we know it was an obstruction in the bile the bile is too thick it's creating a
sluggishness and it's kind of clogging everything up and tutka thins the bile all right so what
should we do if we have gas trends number one you need to decrease stress as much as possible okay
that's easier said than done but i'm going to put a link down below of some things you can do
you want to increase more sleep that's going to greatly reduce cortisol taking vitamin
d can help because vitamin d will help lower cortisol zinc carnosine will also help gastritis
do things to support the adrenal like adaptogens lemon balm tea things like that keto
keto helps take people out of the flight or fight mode also fasting will help repair inflammation
probably more than anything else i know and so will vitamin d they're both very powerful
anti-inflammatories and then you may also want to use mastic gum instead of some alkalizers because
it's more natural and that can help decrease the acid as you're fixing the underlying cause but of
course with all this advice check with your doctor before doing any of this thanks for watching

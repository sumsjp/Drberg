i'll show you how to make a homemade
protein bar that's really delicious and
it's very easy to make and you can
actually keep it in the refrigerator or
the freezer
and then take it out when you need it
and have it right after a meal so if you
wanted to learn how to make that you can
fast forward to that section at the end
of this video but i want to spend a
little bit of time on something very
very important that has to do with
reading labels and really identifying if
something is healthy or not now when we
talk about keto friendly all we're
talking about
is is that product less than 50 grams of
carbohydrate it has nothing to do with
the type of
carbohydrates okay as long as you're
below 50 grams of carbs you're good even
if those carbs are sugar if it's less
than 50 grams it's keto friendly but i
want to differentiate healthy keto from
just keto
friendly because i believe that some of
these keto friendly products are
not safe because you should really know
some of these ingredients that they're
sneaking in these different products so
i'm going to show you uh this one right
here um you'll see this lilies no this
is not a protein bar but it's lily's
crispy rice
dark chocolate bar okay so it says here
certified gluten free
it says
stevia sweetened no sugar added boy that
sounds pretty good
less sugar sweet life
but the most important thing to do is to
look at the ingredients underneath
the supplement facts this thing right
here you read that right there and it
says unsweetened chocolate chicory root
which is fine
and then they get into dextrin what is
dextrin that's a synthetic
fiber and then it has erythrotol then we
have cocoa butter organic
crispy brown rice okay what is that well
it's organic brown rice and organic rice
syrup okay
that is not a healthy keto okay so
right there you don't want to consume
this product now unfortunately a lot of
the stevia products like stevia in the
raw for example
has this filler of maltodextrin
maltodextrin as i talked about in a
recent video is probably one of the
worst ingredients that you can
consume because how it's rated on the
glycemic index is like way way higher
than actual sugar it's like between i
think 106 and 136 okay and sugar is like
74. so it will really spike your blood
sugars
now there's a couple other ingredients i
want to bring your attention to
a lot of these new
synthetic fibers
or man-made fibers that are not really
from
food like you would think
are now being promoted as helping your
blood sugars
like the like the soluble corn fiber aka
resistant
maltodextrin so this is really confusing
to people because you have the
maltodextrin which is like the
sugar which by the way is not listed
under sugars it's just classified as a
carbohydrate
now being called a resistant
maltodextrin okay
so basically what they do is they're
changing the chemistry
of the carbohydrate being a
polysaccharide to a fiber there's not a
lot of research that you can find on
this
it's a fairly new thing that was created
and so i don't know about you but i
don't like to jump into this new
ingredient that's synthetic and that's
highly processed with certain chemicals
and solvents and high heats and then
think it's really really safe until all
the safety studies have been done and
maybe a long-term study to really see
is it really safe
i mean we already know the regular
molten dextrin is really bad
this new resistant
maltodextrin
the jury is not out yet because it's a
very new product but the problem is if
you label it as the soluble corn fiber
you don't even know it's resistant
maltodextrin and they also have another
one that's called tapioca starch
or corn starch well that's also
resistant maltodextrin
so they can make maltodextrin on a lot
of things they can make it out of corn
wheat potato
all sorts of things
and so i'm going to highly recommend
that you avoid anything with soluble
corn fiber
tapioca fiber
maltodextrin resistant maltodextrin
as well as dextrin and dextrose
and other sugars
now let's talk about just these these uh
bars that you would buy right they may
be protein bars or just
it might be keto friendly bars let's
start with
ideal protein i don't know if you've
heard about that company but
if you read the label
the first ingredient is soy protein
isolate that's a
a very processed
fractionated protein product
with hexane which is a solvent and it's
just not a natural type of protein that
i would want in my body and they also
use maltodextrin sucralose which is the
type of sugar that they added a chlorine
molecule and there's a lot of
issues with that type of sugar so i'm
not going to recommend that and then
they also use modified cornstarch right
in the so-called weight loss
bar not to mention synthetic vitamins so
the quality of ingredients is so low
it is definitely not considered healthy
keto ideal protein
is a program with packaged foods
you can have snacks so they're not doing
an imminent fasting it is low carb but
the quality of carbs
are not what i consider quality and it's
low fat so you may lose weight for sure
but from my observation you're not going
to look that healthy
and they have like these different
phases phase one two three and four and
phase four is basically a maintenance
where you you can start to
bring back in these carbohydrates so i
really don't even understand the concept
because you're gonna
do this lose the weight and then you're
gonna go back to your old ways well i
mean i think people think if they get
the weight off then they'll just keep it
off right well not if you go back to
what you've been eating
so
if you haven't heard this philosophy yet
i'll say it again it's not lose weight
to get healthy it's get healthy to lose
weight and the way you get healthy is
you
consume healthy ingredients
all right now let's talk about slim fast
now there's two different
types of products that slim fast is
putting out there right now
they're regular weight loss products and
then they have the keto products okay
now of course the regular slim fast
products are just loaded with sugar and
and really poor ingredients but their
keto products also have some ingredients
that i don't like
and i'm going to list them right now iso
malto
oligosaccharides okay
from tapioca that's one of their
ingredients at one time i did recommend
it but i don't recommend it anymore
because it was spiking people's blood
sugars and of course they also use the
soluble corn fiber
and just so you know the reason why they
use it is because it really
helps the texture of that product and
then they add some tapioca starch
or corn starch and then we have the
quest bars okay now in the quest barks
they have the soluble corn fiber again
right which is resistant maltodextrin
and they also use a sweetener called
sucralose which is a sugar that has an
extra chlorine molecule which creates a
lot of other issues which i will have to
do a video on that topic at some point
and then lastly okay the atkins bars
okay the atkins bars wow if you take a
look at those ingredients
you have
polydextrose okay which is a
sugar that's very high in the glycemic
index they put in maltitol as a
sweetener it's the worst sugar alcohol
that you can use it's definitely going
to spike your blood sugar so the next
time you buy a keto friendly bar read
the ingredients okay before you buy it
now this next part is very very
important especially if you haven't seen
my last video on maltodextrin
but in the way maltodextrin is
classified is not
as a sugar it's classified as a total
carbohydrate so
this is a little loophole that certain
companies use when they say that less
than one gram of sugar because the
maltodextrin is not classified as sugar
it's a carbohydrate so you're not going
to find it in the sugar
amounts
so that also goes with corn syrup okay
so you can have corn syrup and lots of
maltodextrin and be less than one gram
of sugar regardless of how much of that
is in the product it'll be under the
carbohydrates but not the sugar that is
why reading this label especially the
sugars right here
it's not as important as reading the
type of carbohydrate or sugar which is
down here in the ingredients
all right let's now dive into how to
make your own protein bars okay so this
is the ingredients okay you're going to
be eating a bowl and you're going to mix
these ingredients together and then
you're going to form these little bars
and then you're going to put them in the
freezer okay in the freezer now you
could also put them in the refrigerator
if the freezer is too solid i like to
keep them in the freezer and i don't
consume these as a snack i consume them
as a dessert after a meal and they're
quite delicious
all right here's the recipe number one
you can use one stick of butter now
i would use kerrygold and if you don't
want to use the butter you can use a
half of a cup of either coconut oil
or coconut butter number two you're
going to use two tablespoons of a really
good sweetener like
xylitol or
erythritol
i want to bring up your awareness on
this one point
when you look at some of the keto
sweeteners
like stevia and the raw for example they
put a lot of maltodextrin
so
because certain sweeteners like monk
fruit and stevia are super concentrated
super sweet way more than sugar a lot of
times they'll add a filler to it and the
filler they usually use is either
you know maltodextrin or dextrin
so again start reading the labels
to make sure that you get the version
that doesn't have these added things in
it
all right now you're going to add some
protein you're going to add
one cup
of either
coconut flour
okay or
whole egg protein powder okay you can
get that online
that would be my best option
or
whey protein powder okay so that's three
ingredients we're gonna go two more
ingredients the fourth one is nuts i
like to use crushed pecans but you can
use crushed walnuts
peanuts almonds whatever nut you want to
use i usually put a cup in a baggie and
i'll take like a rolling pin and i'll
just kind of crush the nuts or i'll take
a little hammer and pound them so it
crushes the nuts and then i'll take that
and put it in the bowl all right last
ingredient would be one cup of chocolate
chips now again you're going to have to
read
the ingredients of the chocolate chips
there's a couple really good brands that
i would recommend
the keto factory brand chocolate chips
are good because they don't have any
hidden maltodextrin you have a people's
keto company brand
you have lily's bran chocolate chips
those are the semi-sweet baking chips
and then you have netivo which i really
like their chips because
it's just unsweetened chocolate with
allulose okay which is not a sugar
alcohol but it's a
type of sugar that is very low on the
glycemic index
okay so those are the five main
ingredients but we're going to also add
some minor ingredients i'm not going to
count those as major ingredients you're
going to put a pinch of sea salt into
this and then also one teaspoon of
vanilla extract okay
you're going to mix this really well
okay and then you're going to get a
cookie sheet with some wax paper and
then start forming these little bars
and then you're going to put it right in
the freezer okay within about probably
three or four or five minutes it's going
to be pretty hard and then you can
actually take it out if you don't put in
the freezer or the refrigerator it's
going to melt on you because of the
butter or the coconut oil i've learned
from my own mistakes
i keep them in the freezer and then i
take it out i don't know maybe five
minutes before i'm going to eat it and
then i will eat it right after a meal
all right so now that you have know how
to make your own protein bar i think a
really good video for you to watch would
be the one on maltodextrin i just
mentioned which is titled the worst
ingredient in the world check it out
right here

so what is it about a carbohydrate that depletes your vitamin b1 well vitamin b1 is necessary for
the metabolism or breakdown of carbohydrates they call it carbohydrate catabolism okay so catabolism
means the breakdown of something so the more carbs someone consumes the more b1 is necessary now this
also goes for alcohol dextrose ids let's say you're in the hospital and they're feeding you
dextrose which is a synthetic sugar you will eventually be depleted of vitamin b1 stress can
also deplete you of b1 and also being a diabetic because you have this high amount of sugar that's
flowing through your your blood vessels and b1 is critical for biochemical pathways a lot of your
brain chemistry neurotransmitters like gaba that makes you calm dopamine related to pleasure all
require vitamin b1 nucleic acids that's your genetics fatty acids and even steroids like
steroid hormones need vitamin b1 also b1 defends against oxidative stress this is why when you're
on a high carb diet you become a pre-diabetic and a diabetic you become division of b1 and then you
start getting peripheral neuropathies or neuritis which is nerve pain using your fingertips or your
toes or the bottom of your feet and just as a side note if you have peripheral neuropathy in your
diabetic the simple remedy is to take benthotamine okay binfotamine is a special type of b1 it's a
fat soluble b1 so it penetrates the nerves and it's very effective against diabetic neuropathy
now the two most sensitive tissues to a vitamin b1 deficiency are number one your nerves slash
brain and number two your heart if the nerves are involved you're going to get neuritis neuropathy
anxiety you're going to feel very agitated you're going to have a lot of nervous energy built up and
it's going to be very hard to relax if you have a severe b1 deficiency it can cause that uh dementia
and confusion and even nightmares and so if your kids are having nightmares or you're
having nightmares be one it'll handle it now if the heart is affected with a b1 deficiency
your pulse rate will start going up you'll start developing edema in your lower legs
and you could even experience heart failure but other than that you're going to be totally fine
and of course the best source of b1 is a natural source i recommend nutritional yeast i put a link

hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about what happens when the gallbladder is
removed I get a lot of questions and I want to answer it so this is what happens first of all
your liver makes bile okay bile is stored in the gallbladder bile is like a detergent that
helps you break down the grease it's a fluid that helps dissolve dissolved fats alright and
the gallbladder concentrates the bile by 20 times so when you have bile in the liver if you compare
it to the gallbladder it's super concentrated and you need that concentration to release when you
eat to be able to dissolve the fats because if it's not that concentrated you're going to get
incomplete digestion of fats the stool is going to start to float you're going to have incomplete
digestion so the purpose of bile is to help you break down fats and help you absorb fat soluble
vitamins vitamin A to prevent night blindness skin problems vitamin E for the heart vitamin
D for bone bone pain vitamin k2 to to prevent calcium from building up in the arteries so all
those fats settle vitamins are very important to be able to absorb and digest and also when you
don't have a new file you have problems with them just essential fatty acid deficiencies now and if
you ever heard of like omega-3 fats or omega-6 fats or DHA these are all really healthy fats
that you need for anti-inflammatory effects for the heart for cellular membranes for the brain for
a brain repair for cellular repair so basically when you have your gallbladder out chances are
you're going to be deficient in bile that is the side effect might not show up right away but
down the road it might show up so you know liver concentrate the bile you get incomplete digestion
of fat you become deficient if I settle vitamins you get some bloating because without vile you'll
tend to bloat and you'll get right shoulder pains sometimes because there's an herb it comes right
through here and goes right up to the neck because what happens when if you're not releasing the bile
there's possibly some scar tissue from the removal of the gallbladder or some irritation there
because they never really corrected why you needed a gallbladder out in the first place if you had
stones the question is why did you get stones they didn't correct that well because your decision to
buy on the first place because you're going to develop stones when you don't have enough file
so incomplete toxin elimination so one purpose of bile is to eliminate toxins so you can't
release sin so now we get a buildup of toxins and I also forgot one other function the gall bladder
is essential for helping the conversion of t4 to t3 to help your thyroid work better so without a
gallbladder you might start having hypothyroid symptoms and lastly constipation because vile
helps lubricate the colon all right so now what do you do if you don't have a gallbladder and you
have these symptoms you need to be taking purified bile salts now I put a link down
below of something that I recommend called gall bladder formula because it not only has purify by
ourselves but it has a lot of other stuff it has enzymes for the pancreas it has acidifies for the
stomach it has stone root to help dissolve stones it has a lot of other things just to improve that
whole function alright so thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video

so today i'm going to give you a couple tips on what to do
if your child is a picky eater does your child only consume savory
snacks sugar cereals french fries mac and
cheese cheese sticks frozen waffles and
packaged foods and is he or she unwilling to
consume these things called vegetables or fish or shellfish
or meats usually what's behind this is a nutritional deficiency
ideally the best situation is to start these kids out from birth
with the right foods making sure that there's no nutritional deficiencies
that's the ideal situation but a lot of times when they get to a certain age
it's very very difficult to get your child to consume the right types of
foods but let's talk about what nutritional
deficiency we're dealing with the main one is a zinc deficiency you
see zinc affects smell and taste
and the other problem is if you're consuming these foods you're going to
create a zinc deficiency and if you're consuming refined
carbohydrates or sugar you're going to create a zinc
deficiency so this is number one okay you want to put the zinc back in
two msg there are so many of these types of foods
that have either msg monosodium glutamate
or modified food starch because this ingredient causes that
savory sensation it dilates the taste buds it
makes the food taste better than it really
is and also it will retain water and it will increase appetite
and it increases insulin it's not good and you want to make sure that you read
the labels and make sure your children do not consume
anything with msg or modified food starch and also a lot
of this is in fast food restaurants okay now
if the child is lacking dha in the diet which they usually are
that can affect the mood especially anger
as in trying to get your child to eat correctly right
dhea can help that greatly and then we have
vitamin b1 if the child is deficient in b1
that also severely affects the behavior as well
so if a child has enough b1 they're going to be calm
they're not going to be restless they're going to have more self
control what creates a deficiency here these foods right here refined carbs
what creates a deficiency here all the omega-6 fatty acids in these
foods right here if you're unfamiliar with omega-6 i put
a link down below but an average diet is very heavy in
omega-6 and very low in omega-3 fatty acids what
can you do in addition to giving them some zinc avoiding msg as
much as possible adding dha and b1 well there's a couple
things to make the transition from here to
healthier foods i would start looking at a substitute
food and there's a lot of keto substitute
foods that will replace junk foods and i'm going to put some
links down below of some great recipes from pizza
ice cream cookies breads you want to find a substitute that you can replace
versus telling the child you can't do it you just say eat
this instead of that and slowly start to buy
these foods and eliminate these foods right here next thing is to
get your child to start making the recipes with you that's the
ideal situation i know my wife has done this with my
children for for many years and it works great
they love to cook they start making these recipes you
start educating on them and then they start eating it especially
if they main it next thing is that if you can't do this all at once
and it's going to take some time to transition and you're still going to
have to feed them some of these foods get to
agreement that they have to at least supplement with zinc dha and b1
if they're going to consume this so at least their body chemistry will start to
come more in balance it'll make it easier
to come off these foods check out the links down below
and start making the shift
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder absolutely
you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe
and make it yourself it's just so easy to be keto

making it as much as we are enjoying eating it

now in many other videos i've talked about the importance of vitamin b1
because if you're deficient this is what's going
to happen the first symptom you're going to get is
a type of anxiety or a nervous like restless feeling
which is really going to affect your ability to tolerate stress so you're
going to be a bit edgy so restlessness even restless leg
syndrome is a b1 deficiency if it becomes very severe you start
developing panic attacks the fastest way to get rid
of a panic attack is to take some b1 also you have lack of stamina
and fatigue and even an excess amount of sweating
i don't know if you've ever seen someone that just breaks out in the sweat for no
reason or they're always sweating that's a b1
deficiency now what is the best source of b1 that's what i want to talk about
in this video right here nutritional yeast because
it's a natural source especially if you get
it unfortified without the synthetic vitamins they
usually add in there now if you're doing short-term synthetic
vitamins it should be okay but a long-term maintenance dose of
synthetic b1 not a good idea but these are the foods
that have the most b1 number one is pork now of course a
lot of people don't eat pork it's totally fine
you can get b1 from many other sources but i'm just going to mention the foods
that have the most b1 so 6 ounces of pork will give you 1.1
milligrams of b1 which will give you 96
of your rdas now normally an adult needs between
1.0 and 1.2 milligrams of b1 okay number two salmon has a good amount
of b1 in six ounces you're getting 0.6
milligrams which will give you 48 of your rdas
okay one ounce will give you a half of a milligram
point five milligrams which is 39 of your rdas then we get the sunflower
seeds one ounce is 0.4 milligrams will give
you 35 of the rdas green peas 1 cup will give
you 0.4 milligrams 35
macadamia nuts 1 ounce 0.3 milligrams will give you 30 acorn squash one cup
will give you 0.3 milligrams which is 30 of your
requirements for b1 it's not just the consumption of
foods that have b1 it's certain foods that you're eating or
certain things that are depleting b1 consuming refined sugars and
carbohydrates severely deplete b1
chronic stress will deplete b1 taking diuretics depletes b1
metformin if you're taking that medication for diabetes
that depletes b1 if you're a diabetic or a pre-diabetic and you have high blood
sugars that alone can create a b1 deficiency
if you haven't seen my other videos on b1 i put them up right here

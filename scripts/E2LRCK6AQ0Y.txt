i wanted to do a quick video and share a tip on what to do for irritable bowel syndrome
as well as ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease and any type of inflammatory problem you have in
your bowels and it's using turmeric now this was demonstrated both in animal and human studies
using about two grams per day and the active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin okay that's a
special plant compound that is probably one of the most potent anti-inflammatory remedies
found in nature so you definitely want to use it if you have any type of bowel inflammation
it tends to inhibit two very powerful enzymes involved with inflammation it will help decrease
pain and inflammation similar to what aspirin and ibuprofen will do and the mechanism is very
similar to vitamin d so you might even also want to add vitamin d if you have this but turmeric
is a very good thing because it's very effective and it has virtually no side effects you can also
increase the absorption two different ways you take one tablespoon of curcumin powder
and you mix it in with one to two eggs okay and one teaspoon of coconut oil and then you
basically lightly fry this and you consume that because it'll actually emulsify within the protein
you can also take one tablespoon of curcumin powder in one quart of boiling water and
boil it for 10 minutes okay and then let it cool off and drink it within four hours and
it'll actually uh dissolve into a solution that's very easy to digest in your body all right check
it out and thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

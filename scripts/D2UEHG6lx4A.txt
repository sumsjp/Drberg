we're going to talk about magnesium's effect on calcium but let's first talk
about what magnesium does it's involved in over 350 biochemical reactions it's a
coenzyme and that means it's a helper mineral involved in enzyme reactions
which are like the protein machines in the body that do all the work
magnesium is also a key electrolyte and electrolytes conduct electricity within
the fluid of your body magnesium affects the relaxation of
muscle nerve transmission fluid balance pH ATP production which is the energy
currency of the body magnesium is also involved in mood making serotonin it's
also involved in making melatonin which actually can help you sleep as well it's
an anti stress mineral involved in the adrenal hormones it's involved in
bone physiology heart physiology and supporting insulin so you can see it's
very very important now up to 60% of the entire population has a subclinical
magnesium deficiency and subclinical meaning that it doesn't show up in a
blood test but you're deficient because the actual deficiency is inside the cell
ninety-eight percent of all the magnesium is inside the cell not outside
the cell so when you get a blood test and you find that your magnesium levels
are normal in your blood it doesn't really mean anything because most of the
magnesium is inside the cell the RDAs for magnesium in men are 420 milligrams
and for women they're 320 the best sources of magnesium are in pumpkin
seeds and then spinach and then Swiss chard and sunflower seeds leafy greens
and salmon chlorophyll which is the blood the plant has a very similar
chemistry to our own blood and the difference is that we have iron which is
red in the center of our blood molecule and the plant has magnesium which is a
slight green color in its chlorophyll one of the really important things about
magnesium is keeping calcium outside the cell if there's enough magnesium inside
the cell it can prevent calcium from going inside the cell
creating damage in fact the ratio of magnesium to calcium inside the cell is
ten thousand to one when there's low magnesium and the calcium gets out of
control you start getting calcification but if
you think about how many medical conditions involve calcification
calcification in the arteries calcification in your kidneys
calcification in your eyes on the nerves and the brain there are many many
conditions that involve excessive amounts of calcium buildup and yes we
need vitamin k2 to actually help mobilize the calcium out of the soft
tissue magnesium is just as important when we have too much calcium and too
little magnesium you get a hyperexcitability of the nervous system
so you start getting little twitches you know in different parts of your body
maybe the left eyelid or another part of the body you also have problems with
insulin insulin starts going up so having the right ratios of magnesium to
calcium can keep your insulin in check also having enough magnesium can prevent
calcium from causing stiffness and sticky blood which can lead to excess
clotting also having enough magnesium actually prevents the liver from
producing too much glucose and lastly I already mentioned this having enough
magnesium can prevent the formation of kidney stones so I recently created
several really interesting videos about magnesium one was the relationship
between magnesium in your sleep cycles and the other is the best foods that are
magnesium rich and keto friendly I put them right on the screen and also down

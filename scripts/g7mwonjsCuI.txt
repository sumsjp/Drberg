so i want to talk about a very common problem with most people and it involves uh tight muscles tight
traps specifically on the right side up here so many people when they go to massage therapists
they get their shoulders massaged and it's always tight on the right side because it is so easy to
fix it's completely unnecessary and the problem is not what you think so let's take a look at
what's going on so we have the vertebra on the back okay there's seven uh vertebra in your neck
called cervical vertebra and then you have the scapula okay scapula is on the back part of your
shoulder it's a bone and there's a muscle that raises the scapula and the muscle is attached to
the corner of the scapula and it and it attaches to the cervical spine one through four okay then
you have also one on the left as well but we're going to focus on on the one on the right and
i'll tell you why in a second and so the purpose of this muscle is to raise the shoulder blade
okay it's called the levator scapula muscle it elevates the scapula now there's a superficial
muscle or a muscle on top of that called the trap okay and that attaches to the back of
your skull called the occiput on the spine of the scapula which is an extra little bone right there
and then it comes down and attaches to your your thoracic spine through here so it's a very broad
diamond shaped muscle that is on top of this levator scapulae muscle so when people complain of
right trap pain it's not their trap it's the levator scapulae muscle but it's not even that
there's another root cause underneath that that is tightening up that muscle
and it's called the phrenic nerve and the phrenic nerve goes from the diaphragm and you have one on
the left one on the right so it primarily controls the diaphragm which is the muscle so it also has
sensory nerves so it has both the sensation and motor control which basically controls the muscle
it goes from the diaphragm all the way up to the third through the fifth vertebra okay so that's
where it connects to so basically what happens is when your gallbladder or liver is inflamed
congested swollen it's going to put pressure on that nerve and send signals up to the neck which
is going to cause a guarding or a protective mechanism on the levator scapulae muscle
which is a tightness that's what that tightness is so you can massage it till the cows come home
i had this problem probably my whole life i didn't know what it was until my late 20s but it's really
coming from the gallbladder usually the people who have pain right up here also have a full sensation
underneath the right diaphragm what's happening is there's a blockage in the drainage of the little
ducts they're called bile ducts and then bile is backing up into the liver and bile is a detergent
and that is irritating and creating inflammation in the liver as well as in the bile ducts and
that is what the problem is and it's such an easy problem to fix all you have to do
is lower your carbohydrates that's called healthy keto decrease the omega-6 fatty
acids that's all the vegetable oils very important i put a video down below for those
people who have not been to my channel you need to know about that because that's going to be
huge take some purified bile salts okay put more information about that what that will do
is it will open up the ducts it allows drainage and the inflammation will go down to basically
zero in your liver and you'll start getting a lot of relief do a moderate amount of fats okay don't
go crazy with too much until you build up your own bile reserve and this is the big one number four
cut out snacking that is the killer this grazing all day the snacking never gives your gallbladder
a chance to reset and heal it becomes overwhelmed it backs up and you need to cut out the snacking
and do what's called intermittent fasting and then number five is increase your fasting so
if you don't eat the whole digestive system has a chance to reset this is so simple and that's
why i'm emphasizing it because it's unnecessary to have this pain over and over again and you're
gonna get a lot of relief from this so try it out and comment down below before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on
keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by
to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

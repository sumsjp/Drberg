now how the heck could someone gain three pounds from just eating one
tiny little small meal someone had a question about that so i wanted
to create this quick video just to explain exactly why this can occur
all right take a look at this you have glucose molecules okay all strung together
is glycogen so glycogen is stored glucose for every gram of glycogen stored in the body
there's three to four grams of water that is stored with glycogen so take a look at this
how much water that a person is accumulating when they consume glycogen sugar or carbohydrate
so i will guarantee that this one small meal was either something sweet or some carbohydrate
if you consume one pound of carbohydrate okay with sugar you're going to now accumulate and hold
and retain three to four pounds of fluid water and that is where the weight's coming from it's
coming from the fluid if you stop eating the carbs and consume more potassium for example this fluid
will go away but i think it's really important to really get this concept when you consume
sugar you retain fluid big time all right if you're new to my channel and you're not sure what
to eat i put a link down below check it out before you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you

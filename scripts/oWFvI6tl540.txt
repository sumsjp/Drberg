so today we're going to talk about macros and i'm going to give you an easy way to calculate
the quantity of macros on keto i have a picture of a plate here and it's divided in half on the left
side we have the carbs on the right side we have fat and protein and so the difficulty of really
showing you this is that most foods are not a pure fat carbohydrate or protein they're a combination
of things so the way i did this should be pretty simple so let's start with carbohydrates you want
the majority of carbohydrates to be vegetables at least seven cups or servings okay now how
much is that how could you visualize that well if you know about cups you could just
take a cup or just take a fist full of salad so you need a minimum of seven cups now problem is
that quantity is not going to fit on the half of your plate so i recommend getting an additional
bowl to put your salad in now if you're going to do other types of vegetables not leafy greens
like broccoli cauliflower bell pepper carrots etc then the quantity goes down to about three and a
half cups or servings which is about three fistfuls of those dense types of vegetables
and those would definitely fit on half of your plate one cup or serving equals 250 milliliters
now if we're going to add berries in there strawberries blueberries and raspberries and
there's other barriers as well you can measure that by just having like a cupped hand full of
berries on your plate all right now other carbs well there's carbs and avocados there's carbs in
hummus there's some carbs and olives but those three have a combination of carbs and fats so
i put them right in the kind of the center there and so if you're going to do olives roughly that
would be like a half of a cup and you can pretty much judge that if you know what a cup looks like
hummus same thing half of a cup avocado we're just talking about a half of an avocado or a lot
of times i'll just do a whole avocado so roughly between a half to a whole now let's shift to the
fat and protein normally that's combined and i recommend that you try to consume the fattiest
protein that you can consume so don't cut off the fat don't take off the skin leave that on try to
consume like fish for example that has more fat like salmon would be the ideal situation
so if you're going to do meat or fish the size of that quantity if you're male should be the size of
the palm if you're male you would do one to two of those okay if you're female you would do one
so that's the size of how much your meat or fish should be i realize this is a generalization so
if you're a large young person with a fast metabolism maybe it's a little bit more okay
so you really have to judge and figure out what's right for you okay so that would be your protein
or let's say you get your protein from eggs that would be between two and four eggs
for that meal now when we get to nuts nut is a combination between a small amount of carb
some is a little bit more than others and protein and fat now a lot of times i'll actually add nuts
to the meat or the eggs to give me a little bit more fat and so that would be like a cupped
handful of nuts i like to do pecans sometimes i do walnuts now let's talk about the quantity of
cheese that would be roughly about the size of two of your thumbs of course my thumb is huge so
of course that would be a lot of cheese all right and then peanut butter would be also the size of
two of your thumbs it could be a little bit more could be a little bit less a lot of times i like
to do celery with peanut butter after a meal just because i'm trying to get more fat now as
far as butter goes now i don't recommend adding a bunch of butter to just eat with your meal but
let's say you're putting it over your vegetables or you're cooking with it i really don't want you
to measure it at this point but if you wanted to measure it let's say two tablespoons of butter
and then we have olive oil which you can put over your salad or even cook with it
and i prefer you not to measure that one because you want to consume a good amount of olive oil and
make sure your olive oil is extra virgin and it's the real olive oil with not extra things so
also want to make sure it's authentic it's the extra virgin olive oil it's not the fake olive oil
coconut oil the same thing don't worry about measuring it just put some in the pan
and cook with it now if you're doing mct oil that could be between one and two tablespoons so
i just wanted to create this video to give a rough idea of your macros and what they might
look like hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what
about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing this course will show
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better
by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below

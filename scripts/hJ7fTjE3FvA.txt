let's talk about getting a second opinion whether it's for some type of medical condition
or whatever an effective treatment solution to a medical problem should not give you
another health problem there are always risks involved or side effects so you
really want to make sure you're getting the correct solution to your problem so getting
a second or third or fourth opinion is really just expanding the amount of data that you have
so you can evaluate more effectively now there's two things i want to mention
when you evaluate you have to have good data you can't have false data you also have to have all
the data to evaluate you can't have missing data and i want to relate this to a recent
situation that i ran into with a friend who had this condition called spondylolisthesis which is a
a fracture in the lower back a lot of people actually have this condition
where the vertebra like the lumbar vertebra should be aligned but what's happening it's
shifted forward because the back part is fractured so then the spinal cord can pinch in the
back part it's called spondylolisthesis and so um he got it from a an old injury he fell on
his tailbone and apparently created a fracture didn't know it then later in life he had back
pain he didn't know what it was he had an x-ray and sure enough he had this condition um you
have to realize that there's a lot of ligaments and tendons and muscles that hold that in place
and so there are certain levels or grades of having this condition from from grade one to three
or four when it gets really really severe and so anyway he had this condition he went to the doctor
and uh he wanted a second opinion from me i looked at his x-rays it was a grade one
it was not majorly severe and he had some mild symptoms and he was going to physical therapy
and the doctor said you better get the surgery or you're going to be a cripple he said the surgery
is totally safe and the physical therapy is not really long lasting so that was the data
he had to evaluate and so when you evaluate you need to have all the information available and
the problem is with you doing research you might google it but you might not find it in the first
five pages you have to dig deep because sometimes this data is buried but here
are some of the missing data that i told him number one um just from experience working with
you know tens of thousands of people i've ran into quite a few people with this condition and there
are certain exercises that can majorly help this condition which by the way i will do a separate
video on and these exercises can stabilize that condition to the point where the person could
literally be without pain now it is true that the complications from surgery is rare however
there are other things that could definitely increase the risk of getting these complications
number one if you're a smoker well guess what he's a chain smoker number two if you have arthritis
well guess what he has massive arthritis through this entire spine so the risk of some of these
complications are definitely higher now the other piece of information that i gave him so he can
correctly evaluate what the doctor told him as far as success level well in my book doesn't
seem to be that successful or effective but when you actually look at the studies
it was 73% successful so what does that mean you have a 73 percent of having a successful surgery
what about the other percentage what happens with that is there permanent damage
what type of side effects is it really going to be safe enough not to give you another problem
could there be any accident where the person is permanently
paralyzed that was the question i want to know and that potentially could happen too so a 73
success rate especially when he's getting therapy and he's almost pain-free just does not make
sense i also told him this anytime a doctor is using fear to motivate you that's not a good
motivating factor you should just give that patient all the data so they can truly evaluate
based on true information and having all of the data there now i want to mention one more
point when you evaluate something sometimes the patient is invalidated or made wrong for looking
at another viewpoint or another opinion i think that's definitely not okay as well so let's say
they want to look at alternative care or nutrition or different diet that is sometimes invalidated as
something that's quackery or it has no scientific basis or the science is settled and you shouldn't
look at that or even consider that and i say that because when you start to really look at
research and how much corruption there is i mean it's incredible the problem is most people
cannot comprehend the research and so they're always getting second hand information by getting
some interpretation or an opinion from the actual research because i mean when i even read certain
research on keto for example and you find out the research was an observational study based on a
questionnaire or that the so-called ketogenic diet really wasn't a ketogenic diet it was actually a
high carb diet with high fat so you really have to have all the data make sure it's factual
make sure that there's nothing missing in order to make the best decision all right thanks for

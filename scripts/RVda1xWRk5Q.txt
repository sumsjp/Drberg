so today i want to talk about what does gall stones and kidney stones
have in common okay first of all a gallstone is a cholesterol stone
a kidney stone is more of a calcium stem so that's definitely what they don't
have in common okay what happens with gallstones is you get
this super saturated uh cholesterol particle that builds up
because you are lacking bile bile normally is supposed to break up things
and keep your cholesterol from binding and forming stones if you have a
gallstone we know you have low bile and there's even tests
that can be done to measure the ratio of your cholesterol to your bile so your
cholesterol bile ratio just to see what that's at so the lower
the bile the more concentrated the cholesterol
the more the gall stem now the kidney stone there's several
different kinds this is the most common one right here calcium oxalates and it
binds and it has these really jagged edges
that can create a lot of pain and discomfort and bleeding in your
kidney and also the pressure that builds up because it's obstructing
the urine flow this is what they both have in common
if you look at the condition crohn's which is a malabsorption
problem of your intestines you nearly always have low amounts of bile
production now that's probably because the last
part of your small intestine is damaged and that's where you're
supposed to absorb and recycle bile 95 percent
of all your bile gets absorbed at the last part of the small intestine before
it goes into large intestine and gets sucked back and recycled if
your intestine is damaged you're not going to recycle that so
you're going to be deficient in bile and what's interesting about crohn's and
different types of malabsorption problems is that
there is a high risk of not just gallstones
but kidney stones as well and here's some extra data that you need to know
bile binds with calcium and oxalates so if you have enough bile
it can help you decrease the risk of building up this calcium oxalates in the
kidneys because it will decrease the amount of
calcium and oxalates that's present in your urine and so
there's a bile connection a bile deficiency
in both gallstones and kidney stones if we take it one step
further we look at fiber fiber also can decrease the risk
of kidney stones because it binds with calcium
and oxalates so one thing you need to know is that a good amount of vegetable
in your diet will help you also vegetables contain magnesium which
will also decrease the risk of kidney stones and
they're a good source of potassium which also can help reduce the risk
of kidney stones and another point about kidney stones is that if you're at risk
it's very very vital that you consume over 2.5 liters
of fluid every single day that will keep things diluted enough where
these calcium oxalates can't form now your microbiome bacteria
make bile salts as well so your liver makes the primary bile salts
they come down and your microbes take those primary bio salts
strip off a few things little proteins and things like that and then turn them
into secondary bile salts so the microbes are involved if there's
a problem with microbes let's say you had an
antibiotic for example or a series of antibiotics
and you don't have enough microbiome you could also become deficient in bile
thereby increasing your risk kidney stones
and gall stones so it's not a really simple thing you have to understand
the whole picture you have to make sure you have some fiber
fluids your microbiome you want to make sure that you take care of your
your intestines and if you're developing a gallstone or kidney stone
it wouldn't hurt to start taking purified bile salts
to help to start binding these calcium and oxalates
as well as to break up some of this cholesterol all right
thanks for watching

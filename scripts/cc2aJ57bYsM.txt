so I had a question from someone that wanted to know why would you use MCT oil
in your coffee well let's talk about that there is something called
bulletproof coffee where you're combining one cup of coffee could be
between eight and twelve ounces with one to two tablespoons of butter and one to
two tablespoons of MCT oil then you would blend it up and drink it and
there's many benefits to doing this especially when you start out doing keto
especially intermittent fasting because it allows you to fast longer when we
talk about MCT oil we're talking about medium chain triglycerides these are
special fats usually made from coconut oil that turn into ketones pretty fast
so you're able to generate ketones as fuel without really changing your diet
and a lot of times people add turmeric or cinnamon or unflavored chocolate
powder or even sea salt to spike it sometimes even chili powder as well
that'll actually give it a kick but let's talk about the benefits of doing
this number one you're gonna have physical energy why because ketones are
their preferred fuel of the brain in the heart so you're gonna have more energy
right away and especially if you're working out it's gonna help you get more
endurance all right next one is mental clarity if there's any type of problem
with your focus or memory what that means is that your neurons are starving
of glucose if you give it another fuel source
ketones it will prefer that it will like it and your memory and your clarity in
your focus will improve and then the other thing is reduce appetite so if you
want to fast longer and not be hungry MCT oil is one option there now also
ketones give you more oxygen less co2 so compared to glucose it's just way better
and also I already mentioned this will increase your time of fasting so it's
really important especially in the beginning of your program to do this so
you can fast longer because fasting is going to be so important in anything
that can speed that up is going to be very beneficial
also it's going to help in the transitional phase so when you're coming
off carbs and you're transitioning to burning fat it's helpful to jumpstart
the system to get some ketones in your body right away now there's a couple
points I want to mention about MCT oil and I do have my own brand MCT oil and I
want to just give you some insights about this pretty much all of the MCT
oil out there gets their product from the same source and what you should know
is that we don't grow coconuts in the US all MCT oil comes from non-US sources so
when someone says it's made in the US well it's just packaged in the US it's grown
in other countries my product is from Indonesia but just realize that this
right here is kind of a marketing gimmick they don't manufacture the coconuts in
the US that is done overseas and then they export it now the other thing about
MCT oil is I really think it's just way way overpriced
this is a 16 ounce bottle if you compare this with other brands out there they're
charging about twenty five thirty five forty five dollars for a 16 ounce bottle
that is just way too expensive what I charge for this is $12.95 and
it's pretty much the same product as you see pretty much everywhere and if you
start on keto or doing intermittent fasting and you want to try this I put a
link down below check it out I think it could help you

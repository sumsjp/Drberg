so i keep getting this question over and over and over and over again so i'm going
to do another video on this topic people want to know is it healthy to alkalize my body okay
the truth is it's better to acidify your body than to alkalize your body let me explain first
of all we have this scale of ph and at seven we have neutral okay anything higher like in 8 9
10 11 12 you get a ph that's more alkaline okay so the numbers that go higher are more
alkaline the numbers that go lower like six five four are more acid and for every whole number
you're going lower from seven to six you're getting a compound effect by the factor of 10.
so for example if you have a ph of 5 that is 10 times more acid than a ph of 6. okay
all right so that's what ph is you have a lot of different parts of the body that have a lot of
different phs the one that's really significant is the stomach the stomach should be extremely acid
like between one and three now if we compare this to the different fluids of the body the
stomach is the most out of range ph okay in the entire body and so you have the stomach which is
kind of like the main organ that is at the very beginning of the digestive cycle or the chain of
events and so if that stomach doesn't work right or you have a problem with it from that point on
nothing else can work right and the reason i'm bringing up the stomach is because you have
various enzymes that are activated by your ph in other words enzymes those things that help you
with digestion those magical little proteins that allow all the biochemistry to work are controlled
by an optimum ph for example pepsin which is in the stomach which helps you digest protein
works and is activated between the range of 1.5 and 1.6 i mean that's a very narrow range
and that's extremely acid so pepsin will not work in an alkaline stomach okay that means
you're not going to be able to digest protein and if you're not digesting protein that can end up in
the small intestine is undigested protein and it can start creating purification and create
all sorts of problems throughout this entire chain of events because you have like at least 30
feet of intestines right so you can imagine if you have undigested protein at the very beginning part
what happens at the very end part then we have lipase which is an enzyme that helps you digest
lipids or proteins that works in the pancreas and in an alkaline ph now there's another lip base in
the stomach that works in an acidic ph at four to five but the lipase in the pancreas works in an
alkaline state so you have different enzymes in different parts that create different effects
and then you have amylase which helps you digest starches right and that works in a slightly acidic
to a neutral ph atp the energy currency of the body in the mitochondria works at a ph of 9.
that's very alkaline and then arginase which is another enzyme to help you break down arginine
works in a ph of 10 extremely alkaline so what you need to know is that these magical enzymes
that do their work cannot work unless they're at their optimum ph okay so why is that significant
because if you start to alkalize your body whether you're using baking soda
calcium carbonate and acids you're going to create dysfunction throughout the entire digestive
system it's going to create a cascade of effects that's not going to be good if you alkalize your
body why because the stomach is the main first digestive organ it's in the beginning part okay
and also the acid in your stomach triggers the bile release which is alkaline and the
pancreatic enzymes it's like bicarbonates from the pancreas that helps neutralize the
acid both of those things are triggered by the acid stomach so in other words if you were to
instead acidify the stomach you start to activate enzymes that help you break down
proteins and now we're going to have a more complete digestive chain of events
and incidentally 22 percent of the population has low stomach acids that's called hypochlorhydria
okay i'm going to list out the symptoms of low stomach acid heartburn gas bloating food allergies
mineral deficiencies gerd which is treated with antacids by the way and because you're
having acid reflux gut infections because the acid is supposed to kill off the microbes
malabsorption because the acid stomach is supposed to help you absorb certain minerals you're not
going to be able to absorb b12 that well and also you're at risk for cancer in the stomach if
you don't have enough acid in your stomach but the other point i want to bring up is to have a strong
acid stomach it's not always necessary to take an acid okay because to make hydrochloric acid a lot
of times you just need the raw materials you need chloride for example that comes from salt which
i would highly recommend consuming sea salt so if you're low on chloride you can't make hydrochloric
acid you also need sodium potassium zinc and even iodine to make hydrochloric acid however a lot of
people see improvement by drinking just regular apple cider vinegar and retain hydrochloride which
actually can help you acidify the stomach as well here's the point you're going to be much healthier
if you attempt to acidify the body than to alkalize the body simply because the
stomach is the first huge significant organ of digestion and it's very very acid and so when
you start to alkalize the stomach now we create a problem through the entire rest of the digestive
tract all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content
i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

let's talk about lupin flour is it keto friendly now lupin flour comes from the
lupin bean which is a legume very similar to a peanut it's gmo free it has a neutral taste to a
very slight bitter taste it has great texture it's very similar to other flours it's been consumed
for a very long time in certain parts of the world loaded with antioxidants especially carotenoids
and it's very low on the glycemic index let's take a look at the carbohydrates so in one fourth of a
cup and for dennis who's watching it's 31.25 grams okay that's 12 carbs now check this out
guess how many fibers it has 11 grams which gives us only one gram net carb so that's pretty low in
a fourth of a cup and what's very unique about this is that it's void of starch so you could
use it in making pasta bread keto friendly cookies things like that now put some recipes down below
it has 2 grams of fat it has 12 grams of protein so it's pretty high in protein it has b1 magnesium
potassium phosphorus iron zinc calcium now it does have some lectins in phytic acid for those people
that are sensitive um you may have an issue but for most people it should be totally okay so to
answer the question is lupin flour keto friendly well absolutely because it only has one carb

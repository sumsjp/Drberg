hi guys it's me again in this video I
want to share what to do if you've ever
had a nose injury okay now why am I
talking about this because over the last
27 years I've had many many people come
in with all sorts of fatigue in the head
tiredness in the eyes and it all happen
after an injury to the nose Okay I'm
going to show you what to do with that
whether you get punched in the nose or
you get car accident where your head hit
the windshield or the steering column or
some impact where there was an impact to
the Gomes okay so I'm going to show you
a technique you're going to you could
probably do it on yourself but you
probably need someone to do this on you
but I have a person I'm going to show
you I'm going to demonstrate on okay so
you had an injury to your head right but
not the nose okay so I'm going to show
you how to fix an injury to the head
first and then I'll show you what to do
to the nose so your head hit the the
steering column yeah okay did did
someone hit you or you hit someone else
I hit a car the impulse yeah and your
head just went bam right and so once you
create an impact like that and you get
surgery or stitches a lot of times you
can then um get fatigue and like in your
head and just be tired I think you
mentioned you do have that right and you
have some fatigue right now okay so um
is the fatigue in the
head yeah yeah okay 10 being extremely
energetic one being completely tired
what would you rate it right now now
seven a
seven okay so it's not
terrible but there's some fatigue there
right yeah okay so what you're going to
do is and I can see that was the impact
right here or up here it was down here
okay so it's right at the top so what
you want to do is you want to press into
the injury okay so I'm going to press
down on her forehead down into the
injury right like this I'm just going to
apply pressure into the injury not on
the injury down into the
injury I'm gonna hold this for about an
hour no I'm just
kidding now the reason I'm not pressing
up into the injury is because what am I
going to press her eyeballs so I can
press down into the injury
there without messing up her hair which
is the most important
thing Okay now what's that seven right
now was it a seven what is is it
now oh your energy went down no my energ
went up okay so 10 was a lot of energy
zero was no problem with with no energy
you said it was a seven before 10 being
most mostly energetic what would you how
would you rate it now
10 so the energy went up to a 10 it's
that simple so you would do this several
times because what happens that injury
creates kind of a standing wave of a
stuck energy that can just stay there
for years now so we just kind of popped
up the energy because we got some
circulation going on but now let's
pretend that she uh injured her nose
okay again you can press into it but
You' want to take the bone right next to
the nose and press into the bone not
hitting the nose but on the bone next to
the nose and you want to press this
Force now I'm not flipping you off I'm
just using my my middle finger
here I'm pressing into it I'm going to
hold that
okay right up into that little point
where that bridge between the bone and
the nose
starts okay and then I'm going to do it
on the other
side so you're pressing into the nose
and then you want to press down into the
nose we've already did this but I'm just
going to show you a little bit closer
to you'd want to go closer into it just
like
that so you press here here and
down do you feel any different yeah it's
going to actually improve your vision
sometimes and open up your space because
that injury tends to to kind of get
stuck there so again this is so simple
if you had an injury to that nose go
ahead and try this and put your comments
below thanks for watching

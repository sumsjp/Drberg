so you have two scenarios you have one scenario where someone will go on keto and drop four
pounds in one day and they are so excited and they think it's fat loss and then a couple days later
completely shuts down they get discouraged and they quit they think it's not working anymore the
other scenario is when someone goes off keto and they gain four pounds in one day and they're very
depressed and they think oh there's no way i can stay consistent with this it's not going to work
in both scenarios what you have to realize is that rapid weight gain is merely fluid it's not fat
okay so there's no way you can gain that much fat or lose that much fat in such a little time
what is normal if you're lucky one to two pounds okay so that's per week not per day and if you're
going on and off keto back and forth every time you go off keto now you have to kind of
reset and it takes like could take three days before you actually get into a good amount of
ketosis to start getting in there so if you're kind of going off the program every third day
you're going to be very frustrating now one gram of glucose will retain three grams of water so
when your body stores glucose as glycogen you're really like a fluid-filled sponge okay you're just
holding water not just that but high-carb diets cause you to retain sodium and the extra sodium
causes a lot more retention of water in the extracellular area which you're going to see in
your ankles in your feet so if you see people with a lot of fluid retention their ankles or their
feet you know their carbs are just too high and so the best indicator to know that it's working
it's normal and you just have to give it more time is your cravings going away are you less
hungry between meals the hunger is one of the best indicators to know that you're on the right
plan if you're hungry too much and you can't go for a period of time without eating then
chances are you're not doing it correctly and you need to find out how to do it correctly and i'll
put some links down below and the other indicator that's really good is if is your stomach shrinking
okay forget about weight loss is your stomach shrinking as you get healthy to lose weight
all sorts of things happen you may start to gain more muscle mass because you're getting more of
a pair of proteins and that might not show up in weight loss right away a ketone really does act
as a diuretic it gets rid of fluid there's other things you can take like dandelion greens you can
put in your salad you can take it as a supplement yuva yurc is another herb and horsetail is a herb
that you can take to help get rid of fluid celery will really help you get rid of fluid and high
potassium foods as well as potassium supplements will all push the fluid out but these won't work
unless your carbs are low hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

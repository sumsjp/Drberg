let's talk about the seven things that can pull you out of a depression now there's a
link between something called bdnf that stands for brain derived neurotrophic factor and depression
they found that there's no chemical in your body or blood test or whatever
that can diagnose depression okay there's no way to diagnose that but they actually found that
people that are depressed have low levels of this bdnf so i'm going to talk about in this video
and talk about how you can enhance it because all the clinical trials that they try to inject
this bdnf into the central nervous system have failed the question is how can we enhance it
i'm going to show you seven different ways but let's first talk about what is the bdnf
it is basically fertilizer for the brain okay it helps nerve growth it helps nerve differentiation
so it helps to differentiate what these uh stem cells or like pre-nerve cells turn into
also bdnf helps support the maintenance of the synapses between the nerves and so bdnf
actually works in the synapse which is kind of like the space between the two nerves
so as they communicate they have a space to actually go back and forth so the bdnf a message
is sent and it gets received so the other part of the nerve can then receive that communication and
do what it's supposed to so bdnf really helps the brain in many different ways it helps
improve your learning it helps your memory it helps higher thinking it helps you
think more clearly it helps you become more mentally alert it decreases inflammation in the
brain and it also helps the absorption of neural transmitters like dopamine serotonin things that
have a direct effect on your mood alright so let's talk about the seven things that you can
do to increase this bdnf number one deep sleep okay researchers found that sleep deprivation
reduces bdnf so you need at least seven hours of sleep and more importantly you need
quality sleep recently i'm doing an experiment on myself getting more sleep to see how i feel
so i'm trying to get nine hours of sleep which is really really hard so i think i'm close to it
but man does that create an interesting effect on my body i feel so much better when i get more
sleep so i literally have to force myself to be in bed because usually at 4:30 i'm like ready to go
so i have to kind of just wait for a while and then i fall back into sleep going through a rem
sleep i wake up i go back into a rem sleep and i do that like maybe three more times after 4:30. so
sleep is very very important number two exercise exercise is the fastest and most effective way
to increase brain derived neurotrophic factor all right next thing sunlight okay
not just vitamin d but getting more sun very very therapeutic in increasing bdnf
all right number four intermittent fasting as well as regular fasting like periodic prolonged fasting
very very important they found that the alternative day fasting where you're doing
600 calories every other day can increase the bdnf by 400 percent i think if you do every day fasting
about 18 hours i think you're going to see a huge change in increasing bdnf all right next thing
is low carb keto okay that can increase bdnf and of course number six really is keto avoiding sugar
but the action of avoiding sugar directly can help you lose weight and as someone loses weight their
bdnf increases and the last thing you can do to increase your bdnf is start taking magnesium or
eat foods that are high in magnesium like large amounts of vegetables big salads because magnesium
is a natural antidepressant and magnesium is not just in greens it's in pumpkin seeds too it's
pretty high in pumpkin seeds so you might want to add those to your diet as well all right thanks
for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of

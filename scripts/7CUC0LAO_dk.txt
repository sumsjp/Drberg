so i had someone recently ask me a question what's worse
bread or potato so this video is going to talk about each one
let's start with potato now instant potatoes
really spike your blood sugars fast because you're
heating and processing this potato down to this tiny little wafer-like
particle so when you boil it or cook it you're
getting a very fast spike in blood sugars
so that starch is completely broken down so 97. now glucose is a hundred
so you're you're dealing with a product that's very very close to pure
glucose then we get baked potato that's 84. it's pretty high then we get
boiled potato which is 82. the more you cook the potato the worst
effect it has on your blood sugars if you consume a raw potato you're going
to be pretty much good to go in fact i'm going to tell you right now
you can eat as many raw potatoes as you want
okay but of course who's going to eat raw potato it tastes
terrible but the point you need to know is like
the cooking cooking starts breaking down the starch into something that's higher
and higher on the glycemic index now what about a sweet potato
see this word sweet right here there's three times as much sugar
so if you have a choice definitely don't do the sweet potato because it's
pretty sweet all right now if we switch over here to
bread people think that whole wheat bread is so much better
it's virtually the same on the glycemic index 74.
but look at that this is actually lower than potato
so right there this would be worse but bread many times especially white
bread has bleach in there which destroys your vitamin e it
depletes your b vitamins especially vitamin b1
and also if you do whole wheat you're going to have phytates in the brain
phytates or phytic acid will block zinc creating a zinc deficiency and then you
have the gluten the protein in wheat which will tear up your gut create a lot
of inflammation and you may not find that the blood
sugars spike immediately but you may find after
two hours they start going a little bit higher even three
hours they start going even higher when you're consuming
pasta you'll see a delayed spike in blood sugars
so just because you don't see a quick spike in blood sugars doesn't mean it's
not a problem it's kind of delayed you'll see it a
post maybe i don't know two or three hours but when
you get into potato you're going to see an
instant spike what's interesting is that an average american consumes
53 pounds of bread every single year now the question is what is worse well
they're both kind of on the same level because
this creates more of a blood sugar issue but this will create
other issues like zinc deficiency gut inflammation
vitamin e deficiencies and also a vitamin b deficiency but other than that
i think it's perfectly healthy and i'm being sarcastic
thanks for watching

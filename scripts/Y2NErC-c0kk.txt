hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about plant-based proteins now I typically
recommend between 20 and 25 grams of protein per meal and the idea is to have low amounts
of sugary foods in higher protein if you're a vegan lentils 1 tablespoon 1.1 grams okay and I
did leave off some other ones like spirulina and things like that but I'll actually put that in a
chart you can download below tofu make sure you do it organic so it's non GMO 1/2 cup 10 grams
that's pretty good quinoa 1/2 cup 8 grams not too bad it's a bit higher in carbs though hemp
4 tablespoons 12 grams that's pretty good then we have sunflower seeds 1/2 a cup 6 grams that's
pretty high pumpkin seeds 1/2 a cup 6 grams chia seed 1 ounce is 5 grams that's incredible nuts
half a cup 14 grams that's a pretty high protein source almond butter 1 tablespoon is 3.4 it's not
too bad either and then we have tempeh which is a half a cup that's 15 grams that's the highest
protein that's a fermented soy product make sure it's organic non-gmo and humus 1 tablespoon is
1.2 grams so you can kind of calculate it out and I'll give you some ideas on what you're
going to have to eat to maintain this 20 to 25 grams of protein per meal but I go I go ahead
and download the chart below and check it out I'll see in the next video hey guys thank you

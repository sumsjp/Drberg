the pancreas regulates blood glucose levels by secreting insulin this hormone is produced
in the regions of the pancreas known as islets of langerhans populated mostly with beta cells
once released from the beta cells insulin assists glucose entry into different cells
such as the skeletal muscle cells their membranes contain insulin receptors which help the
cells absorb glucose for energy an increase in carbohydrate intake over time results in excess
levels of insulin in the blood a condition known as hyperinsulinemia as a protective
mechanism from this excess cells will then start resisting insulin binding to their receptors this
will inhibit the delivery of glucose in the cell a condition known as insulin resistance to deal with
the high glucose levels insulin will turn glucose into fat which leads to obesity this leads to even
higher levels of insulin over time the beta cells get exhausted and reduces the output of insulin
this imbalance between the high blood glucose resistance of insulin and lower insulin output
leads to a variety of health issues over time the number and volume of eyelids get reduced
less insulin is released and blood sugars now rise too much this becomes type 2 diabetes

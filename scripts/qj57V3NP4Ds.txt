so you always want to fast during an infection as much as possible
it's going to really help you we're going to talk about why fasting is
amazing it delays aging it can extend your life span it does the
same thing with insects and animals and when we get sick
we tend to lose our appetite the reason why is because
fasting creates a profound effect on your immune system
there's all sorts of genetic survival mechanisms that occur
when we stop eating when you stop eating your body starts to
burn your fat you start making ketones ketones have anti-infective properties
so they can act as a antimicrobial to some degree also when you fast you
increase the survival of your t cells and your b cells okay
now the t cells are the ones that run the immune
system kill microbes help put the fire out help
reduce inflammation b cells have to do with making
antibodies so you have a memory of the infection so
you can fight the infection off the next time that microbe comes around
fasting increases from the survival of both of these
but initially when you fast you get a drop in the white blood cells the
lymphocytes decrease in the blood now where are they
going they're going into the bone marrow and
they're going into the gut and they're recharging and they're
eating now we get an increase in memory cells which help
destroy pathogens much faster there's also specific spike
in the t helper cells this is the cell
that coordinates all the other immune actions so it's like the general of the
army and it just so happens as a side note
the aids virus goes after this right here so it
goes after the controller it has some intelligence
that it knows that if it takes this guy out
it takes the entire army out well fasting will
increase the tea helper cells you also get autophagy if you fast long enough
autophagy is a special condition where your body starts to
clean up old damaged white blood cells and things that are not needed and
recycles them also there's other things that autophagy
can stimulate too helping control viral infections
decreasing inflammation and also presenting antigens now what does that
mean presenting energies well certain t cells need to be guided
so they need certain pathogens that are tagged like a
little exon the virus is back saying kill me
and this is what this is all about but you can look at antigens as a little
piece of a microbe like if you were to take um
i don't know if you had a uh i don't know like maybe a dog that's trying to
sniff out drugs and you let the dog smell a certain drug
and he would actually go look for it because now he
has a scent of it and he can find it the same thing with your
immune cells this is like the scent or a piece or a particle
of that pathogen so it knows what to go after
and other cells do the dirty work by killing the pathogens
this is interesting in a three-day fast you can have profound
effects over your immune system you will trigger the stem cells that
regenerate the immune cell you may think it's going to be very
difficult but as soon as you start fasting
it's going to get easier and easier and easier i would take your nutrients when
you're fasting but the point is you can greatly
strengthen your immune system there's two ways that this infection can
affect you one is directly from the pathogen itself
and two is from the collateral damage from your own immune system
especially like rheumatoid arthritis or even autoimmune diseases the damage
is not coming from the pathogen even those pathogens involved it's
coming from your own immune system that's creating all this
collateral damage so when you fast you dramatically reduce
inflammation i would also recommend during an infection to take vitamin d i
would also recommend taking oregano oil which is great for bacterial infections
also in viral garlic is a very powerful and definitely
olive leaf extract for viral infections so
you take these in an empty stomach plus fasting
now you have a really good program and if you haven't taken my immune course
yet it's a free course 21 lessons i put a link down below definitely sign

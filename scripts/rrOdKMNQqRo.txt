you know i love cheese now probably because i'm from wisconsin and i'm
also an american so of course i should love american cheese it sounds healthy
well in reality american cheese is not even cheese it is cold on the back of the label
pasteurized cheese product okay because apparently to be actual cheese
you need at least 51 of the product to be real cheese so what is in this american cheese
anyway well you have a lot of unfermented dairy okay so you have milk milk products
from organic cows right no not from organic cows it's from commercial feedlot cows grain fed high
in omega-6 fatty acids which is pro-inflammatory then you have emulsifiers like sodium phosphate
which is also used in drugs which then have this little warning sign could cause kidney damage then
we have tartrate which if you have too much of it you can get diarrhea they add a lot of salt
to it not sea salt just sodium chloride and of course we need to color it with some artificial
coloring so it can look like cheese then we have to add some whey in there which by the way way
out of all the products is an item that is highest on the insulin index okay so it will
trigger insulin more than any other foods because it's super high in protein and super low in fat so
of course we need to make it taste good right so we had some modified food starch aka also known as
monosodium glutamate okay and then let's add a mold inhibitor to this mix netamycin
which whole food just banned from their ingredient list and we're going to add a little soy and
canola oil to this mixture and then we'll put some synthetic vitamins in there and don't forget
try sodium phosphate now trisodium phosphate is used as a cleaner and a stain remover so
this american cheese sounds so wholesome but behind the scenes i wouldn't say it's
the healthiest thing that you can eat now regular grass-fed organic raw milk cheese or goat cheese
has really good calcium it's loaded with vitamin k2 which keeps your arteries nice and clean it's
a good source of protein without the sugar because it's very low in lactose which is milk sugar it is
a fermented product so it helps your digestion so make sure you choose your cheese wisely so

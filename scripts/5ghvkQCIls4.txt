hey guys hey listen in this video I want to share three important low carb high fat ketogenic tweeks
okay or tips whatever you want to call it number one the ketogenic diet basically says that you
can do 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates okay a lot of times people don't differentiate what
carbohydrates they're using we do potatoes fruit a doughnut a bagel and they get confused with
vegetables and I want to talk about that first because if you take one cup of spinach 20 grams
of carbohydrate is only two and a half cups okay if you do 50 grams is six point to five cups so
in your mind if you're including the vegetable family and you're doing 20 carbs you're doing
like only two cups of spinach that's not going to give you the nutrients that you need to keep
you healthy and the vitamins one cup of kale 20 grams is one cup 50 grams is one and a half cups
imagine just having that just small amount that's not enough one cup of bell pepper one cup is 20
grams two cups is 50 grams 1 cup of spring greens like a salad mixture to two and a half cups would
be 20 grams six point two five cups of these 50 grams so in other words you want to consume 7 to
10 cups of vegetables that's tweak number one and don't let this gram dosage restrict your vegetable
intake you want to keep this high because if you do ketogenic diet without the vegetables you tend
to end up with the fatty liver ok number two we want to add intermittent fasting to the ketogenic
diet the ketogenic diet doesn't normally have intermittent fasting they allow snacks okay so
why do you want to do that simply because the principal or the physiological fact that every
time you eat right whether it's fat or protein you stimulate insulin to some degree and if we
want to handle in some resistance pre-diabetes we have to include intermittent fasting as part of
this eating plan okay number three nutrient-dense fats when you look up a traditional ketogenic diet
it doesn't differentiate the types of fats that you need you could mistakenly just consume all of
your fats to MCT oil which by the way doesn't have a lot of fat soluble vitamins in it or
like heavy cream they don't differentiate hormone core moans in that milk product or
not or vegetable oils they don't differentiate if it's soy or corn oil or some other other oil
that could be harmful because it's GMO here are some healthy fats like the fat that's normally
in proteins that you eat like in different meats like grass-fed beef something like that
or grass-fed dairy the normal fats in there those are actually good for you coconut oil
grass-fed butter olive oil olives avocados nuts nut butters fish while caught those are
the types of fats that you want to make sure that you have in this eating plan and those
are the three tweaks that I would recommend thanks for watching hey you probably already

so I wanted to do a quick video just to answer this question that keeps coming
up as well is lemon juice acid or alkaline okay
because some people will say it alkalizes the body some people say it
will acidify the body well citric acid is an acid it's a very
strong acid in lemons as a pH between 2 and 3 now what does that actually mean
what's the significance of that pH well it's basically ten thousand to a hundred
thousand times more acidic than water okay so lemon juice is acidic very
acidic but as soon as you consume it and it goes in the body gets burned up and
it turns alkaline okay so it does alkalis not your blood or the body but
mainly the urine okay and so the benefit of doing that for certain people that
have gout is beneficial so it can reduce the risk of gout crystals coming out of
solution going into your big toe it can also reduce both uric acid stones and
the kidney as well as calcium oxalate stones because the citric acid will help
bind with the oxalates and prevent the calcium from accumulating also the other
benefit of lemon juice is vitamin C only if it's raw if you buy it out of a
bottle it's pasteurized it's heated and it destroys most of the vitamin C so
lemon juice is acid but it does turn into an alkaline compound after about
one hour of consuming it alright thanks for

so if you have seizures i highly recommend you not only do the keto diet but also add mct oil to your
plan we're going to talk about why so keto has been around for quite a few years and they use it
for children when they had something called drug resistant epilepsy so if you're treating epilepsy
with drugs and the drugs don't work then they would go to the keto diet now why wouldn't they
go to the keto diet first well because there's not a lot of profit in the keto
diet but the ketogenic diet lowers the carb increases ketones and what's unique about that
is ketones can supply energy to damaged neurons so if there's some type of short circuiting going
on in the brain where there's a epileptic seizure there's obviously damaged neurons so
apparently if the nerve cell is damaged glucose is not the right fuel ketones are but mct oil
which is usually from coconut oil turns into ketones pretty fast there's a six-month
randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial done on dogs it was shown to that mct oil
is very effective for seizures now there's also some interesting studies on doing fasting for
epileptic seizures as well i mean i don't know why you wouldn't want to combine
fasting with the ketogenic diet and mct oil i would do that if i had seizures now
there's something else i want to explain to you that's very important your brain prefers ketones
as fuel if given the choice between glucose or ketones your brain will always use ketones as a
priority fuel because it's just a more efficient fuel it's better for the brain it doesn't create
inflammation it's neuroprotective it can increase something called bdnf brain derived neurotrophic
factor which basically helps to restore damaged neurons also it can reduce nerve hyperactivity
which is exactly what's happening in a seizure but also you can use ketones whether in mct oil
whether you're fasting or on the keto diet for adhd because ketones calm down hyperactivity in
the brain all right go ahead and try this if you have seizures and give me some feedback down below
before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to
know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

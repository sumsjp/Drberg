so today we're going to talk about black elderberry an amazing berry
for your immune system especially for viruses i mean it's been used for thousands of years it's
been used by native americans ancient egyptians so it stood the test of time so people use it for
a lot of things for decreasing pain inflammation swelling it's a diuretic so it increases urination
it can help you with your digestive problems especially if you have gas
it can act as a an expectrin to pull mucus out helps your blood sugars it's even been
known to decrease damage from uv radiation and can lower your uric acid but black elderberry
is mainly known for its ability to help with your immune system specifically to act as an antiviral
in a study that i'm going to put down below which is quite amazing it's been demonstrated
to compare ineffectiveness with two of the top anti-viral medications for influenza
and it even increases a very specific cytokine tnf alpha by 44.9 now what does that mean it
means that it activates your immune system it gets your immune system engaged now one thing
about elderberry you never want to consume it raw because it has some cyanide in it and that
can create some serious digestive problems but when it's processed and made into a supplement
all that goes away there is absolutely zero cyanide so you don't have to worry about that
black elderberry is high in a very specific phytonutrient called anthocyanins now because
part of that word is cyanines people think that it's cyanide nothing to do with it but when you
process and dry out and even heat black elderberry you actually increase anthocyanins so you get the
benefit of that phytonutrient without the cyanide which is a really good thing anyway it's a great
um natural remedy that's been used for a very long time especially for viral infections

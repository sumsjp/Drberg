well guys i hate to break this to you but spinach is the absolute worst source of iron
and i know you've been watching popeye the sailor man and all this canned spinach is going to make
you really really strong because of the iron when in fact it's not going to do that there's
two sources of iron there is heme iron and there is non-heme iron non-heme iron
is in plants it has a low bioavailability in other words it doesn't absorb that well so if
you have a certain amount of iron and spinach if you're lucky you're going to only absorb 1.4
of that amount of iron so you're going to need to eat 10 times more spinach to get the same amount
of iron you would get if you consumed something that gave you heme iron which is from animal
products the bio availability with heme iron is 20 but the problem is even if you were to consume a
lot more there's some other reasons why your body is not going to be able to use that iron spinach
and by the way swiss chard have extremely high amounts of oxalates okay oxalates bind with
the iron as well as calcium making iron almost entirely unavailable to you so not only do we have
a non-heme source of iron which is very poor with the absorption rate but we also have this oxalate
right here don't worry it gets worse also plants including spinach are very high in polyphenols
which also block the absorption of iron now you might say well i'm going to get my iron from beans
or legumes or seeds or nuts or grains right well the problem with that is they contain phytates
which block iron zinc calcium and other minerals so i have nothing against spinach or swiss chard
i think they're great vegetables as long as you're not pre-exposed to
kidney stones or you have a sensitivity to oxalates and you can even steam it to reduce
the oxalates and sometimes someone might say that well the spinach also has a lot of vitamin c it's
going to help me absorb the iron well if you steam it to lower the amount of oxalates you
also kill off a great majority of the vitamin c thereby not allowing you to get the benefits of
that extra absorption but spinach and swiss chard have additional health benefits for sure but not
in the area of iron so what does have the best source of heme iron number one clams then liver
kidney and other organ meats oysters octopus mussels red meat fish especially fatty fish
and eggs and as a last point if you consume plants with these animal products
that have heme iron that alone will increase the absorption of iron in the spinach or plants
all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or
you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

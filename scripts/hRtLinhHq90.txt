hey everyone welcome back i have a a guest that i'm gonna interview today special guest
actually she works for me and christie is here hi christy hi hey listen the reason i'm bringing
you up is because um you had or you may still have uh diabetes type one and i wanna know a
little bit about your story so tell us about your story okay uh so i have was i led a normal life
most of my life you know up until my second child my daughter uh during that pregnancy
i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and um i was immediately put on insulin because managing it
was very difficult with diet it was unmanageable with diet so they put me on insulin very quickly
and then they gave me the typical you know reduce your carbs but i was still
recommended to eat like 20 to 30 grams of carbs a meal um so that really wasn't
working i was using a lot of insulin and then i had my daughter teagan and they just
assumed i went back to normal and of course like i wanted to go back to normal so i just
said okay i'm normal and i went back to doing everything that i was doing before
i stopped the medication and stuff and then um about a year after i had her i started to notice
symptoms like i was losing a lot of weight i wasn't really like watching my diet either so that
didn't really make sense for me and i was very tired i was urinating frequently so i just decided
one day to check my blood sugars because i had the stuff from when i was pregnant and uh when i
checked i was like 450 or something like crazy oh my god so um i immediately knew i was a diabetic
and i just assumed that i was a type 2 because i didn't know anything about diabetes so when
i went to the doctor they also assumed that because my mom and my dad and in my family
so um that's what they diagnosed me with with type 2 diabetes and they gave me metformin and told me
to lower my diet which um i did i was very strict low carb the way i thought i should be doing it um
and nothing was you know i was still high and then you know fast forward a couple months we go
off the grid so we're traveling in our rv it's very hard to keep fresh fruits and vegetables
so um i kind of just started not caring i i was like well my mom and my grandma are still alive so
who cares you know i didn't i didn't really think so i just stopped managing it basically i would
every once in a while check my blood sugars and i was high and i would treat it with some insulin
it was just a very dangerous you know thing that i was doing and then um we settled down in missouri
and i started noticing like the frequent urination the um i was always tired i was also starting to
not be able to feel my feet and my hand my tongue i was having spots in my eyes so
i realized it was really important to get serious about it and i started doing some research
and um i found keto as a way to reverse the type 2. so i thought about it but i didn't do it you
know and then i went to the doctor they said your a1c is 10 and a half you need to start using
insulin and that's when i left that appointment i was like i knew insulin makes you gain weight and
that's always been something i've been concerned about so at that point i said i'm going to
do something different and i found like so you your a1c was 10 10 point something okay
yeah okay because normal edge should be like five point five yeah okay right right it was very very
high and uh that's when they were like we've got to do meal time insulin and all of this and i was
like no no you know i'm too young i don't want to do that so i started to do the healthy keto and
doing more research i found doctors like dr you dr berg and then dr fung on the type 2 and how
if you change what you're eating and intermittent fast you can reduce that so i was super excited
i was ready to do it my husband got on board with me and um then i stopped doing the insulin
because i thought i checked with my doctor they said you are definitely a type 2 so go ahead and
give it a try so i did that and um then i also cheated a little bit so i got really
into ketosis and then i did i went and saw some friends in st louis and started to
i for that one meal i just went overboard so i was like in the 500s after that meal and i never came
back down and i ended up going into dka because i was in st louis without my insulin and dka
oh is diabetic ketoacidosis yeah so that's a situation where you have this very very high
blood sugar and very low insulin because you're not taking it and your ph becomes very acidic it
can be very dangerous and that never occurs unless you're you have type one or you have
it's just not you're not controlling your blood sugars but go ahead right and my i did end up um
i went to the emergency room because i went a few days thinking i had the flu and then i got to the
point where i was unable to breathe and and that's when i went to the emergency room and they uh
in the hospital they put me in the icu and in the hospital they were trying to give me insulin and
i was like no i don't want that stuff like i don't need it i'm a type 2. and they were like
looking at me i'm 91 pounds and they're like no like your blood sugars are way too high for you
being in a fasting state you need insulin and they came and they told me you're a type 1 diabetic
we're going to do all the tests to confirm that but that's our belief so that was like
a really hard thing to process um and then when i i left the hospital i still knew
i was going to do low carb because i didn't want to be doing a lot of insulin and um so that's just
what i've been doing so within it within six months my a1c went from 10 and a half to 6.3
and then uh by the year i was at 5.5 and i think when i go i'm gonna go in february again
i'll probably be a little higher because like some things have happened stress i did like fall
off a little bit and i allow things in you know sometimes when i shouldn't so i do think my a1c
is probably closer to six now um but i'm jumping back in i you know things have settled down with
the stress actually just a you know the stress is my my mom uh she's a type two uh but we think
maybe she might be a type one but we you know but she's a type two and not managing her blood sugar
so she actually was found unconscious in a coma and she was in that state for quite some time
so that really like at that moment stressed me out and i did some cheating but now it's kind
of really like seeing her recovery how slow it is she's needing a lot of assistance a lot of therapy
and she needs people to care for her she's been stuck in the hospital where they're not managing
her diabetes well at all which is making it worse and it just reminded me like why i'm
doing what i'm doing i don't want to do that to my family i don't want to do that to myself
so when i'm doing low carb i get to use such little amounts of insulin that
concern is really not present you know if i do go low it's very easily corrected so um that's you
know that's kind of my story and why i'm doing it i started an instagram page and then just finding
this job because you know nobody wants to hear you talk about keto but i get to do it all day long
you know so i just feel so blessed because you did that's the other part my kidneys were failing and
they wanted to put me on medication and i knew based on like the videos i'd watched from you
you know making sure i have plenty of potassium in my diet that i would be able to protect my
kidneys and reverse it and i and now my kidney function is completely normal wow i'm happy with
this and i don't have anything that is so awesome so uh what christy does uh she's actually one of
my keto consultants so she helps people on the phone she answer questions and you have a lot of
personal experience so that is so valuable question i have a couple questions number one
when you are pregnant did you just have regular carbo meals what did you eat while you're pregnant
with the trigger of this whole in the beginning i just
yeah in the beginning i was just eating normal what was that like carbo food i mean fast food
i wasn't a big cooker i and i was very tired with that pregnancy so and i think that might have been
because also i got diagnosed during that pregnancy with hypothyroidism or the hashimoto's so um i was
really tired and then i got really sick too so i was very lazy i you know it was frozen pizzas
taco bell you know fast food it was not healthy at all but then when they told me about the diabetes
i did try very hard but i was doing things like toast and peanut butter thinking that was good for
me and it wasn't wow this this is what so so i'm so interested in creating more videos on what to
eat while you're pregnant because so many women they don't think it's a big deal but oh my gosh
it can be a huge deal um not just for yourself but you know you're carrying a baby um so so presently
right now um you still have to take insulin but you're not taking as much to control things
oh my gosh it's so little yes i mean i do and when i'm really getting into it and i'm adding workouts
i get down to i mean total and this is long lasting and meal time insulin i'm doing like
at max six units a day so um that's like so little yeah and when you think about all the money that
you're saving you know and the you're also saving yourself from further health complications because
you know industrial size doses of insulin are not good for our bodies whether you're a type one
or not you know we we may need it but we don't need that much though right and so
this is another good point i want to mention is the um the complications of high blood glucose
are kind of similar to the complications of high levels of insulin so and the more carbs you have
the more insulin you have to take so why even go that direction because the high insulin is going
to create some problems too and and also where is the carbs going when you take insulin are they
just evaporating now they're actually being shoved in different places in your body and converted to
different things um what what would you say that a normal type 1 diabetic how much insulin are they
taking per day do you have any idea so i would um yeah because i follow some people on instagram and
i i mean and just going from what i was taking before i changed my diet and then even currently
if i do have a pizza pizza um you know i have to take 20 units of mealtime insulin and that still
doesn't cover it or it it's too much and then i have a low that's scary you know so um i would
say like they would be doing 50 plus units a day and it probably just increases over time because
uh you know the insulin resistance is taking place you know and then it's funny because my
doc one of my the nutritionist uh at my doctor's office when i went i was like well my a1c is 5.5
because she was trying to you know fix my diet and i was like i got it you know i know what to eat
and i was like my a1c is 5.5 and she was like oh well that will probably creep up over time because
your pancreas is gonna stop working even more and i'm like no it's pretty much done working you know
like this is this is if it goes up it's because of my diet and i know i'm ready for it i'm gonna
be disappointed in myself but i know it's gone up a little bit because of that period of time
and i just want to add the reason not cheating is is so important it's not just that like okay
yes in a moment my blood sugar was 300. it was hard to undo that cheat you know i i did it in one
moment thinking oh i'm just gonna eat whatever i want right now because i'm so stressed and then i
wanted to do it the next day and then i wanted to do it the next day and it's so hard to break that
so it's like once you get that momentum i was at 5.5 like i i don't think i'll go back again
regardless of my stress because it's not worth it like it just takes so long and like you said the
sugar doesn't just evaporate it gets put places and it takes me like a week to see that completely
out of my body even when i'm eating healthy my blood sugars are higher because i'm getting rid of
all the other the sugar that i ate you know that it stuffed in my liver and so yeah you know that's
why i always i always tell people it's actually good to go off the program just just to experience
this because that way you know you can actually have judgment so no one's like telling you you
have to do this but you you know how your body works you know if i actually go off
the program it's not going to be off for a couple hours you're talking about days yeah just a little
bit and this is also for the average person that's trying to lose weight so i think for
me i was a junk food junkie in my 20s i'm 30 now so that good that's good so what happened is um i
uh i was so bad but it took me it took me years to change my ways because i had to keep experiencing
this painful side effects and consequences to finally says okay that's it i'm going to actually
have discipline now but i think some some people you know they have to learn on their own and
then they have this shift of like you know what okay i'm going to do it now for real so and you
can't really tell people that you can encourage them but they have to kind of go through this
thing i'm like okay go off the program see how you do and then exactly why is it taking so long to
get back on the track well yeah it's an addiction it really is an addiction and and it like pops in
your head you know like you have it one day and the next day now you're like oh i want that again
and i want to win you know and it really is it's a addiction so i'm i think like just
seeing everything that's going on with my mom like firsthand i've heard you know i've heard people
experience that but dealing with it myself and seeing how frustrating it is right when i was in
dka i had the ability to tell them what i wanted but she can't you know she's unable to communicate
how to manage her diabetes not that she was doing it great you know obviously right but um you know
now that i'm involved i'm gonna try to help her and i just feel like i got there too late
but this is where we are and it really hasn't opened my eyes to say okay the cheats are not
good anymore like i'm done i don't want to do it anymore i don't and and i've been feeling
great so i'm gonna i'm seeing the course so i'm curious um when i broke my elbow demolished it
shattered it i had to go to the hospital to get surgery so uh so i get in there and
then i'm like wait a second i didn't bring my food with me and of course they i wake up and
they have crackers jello pudding and i'm asking for some protein or something and they're like
looking at me strange now i'm curious if you're a diabetic and you're in the hospital
um is there any any shift of anything other than the same thing it's so bad dr berg okay because
for the diabetic diet right they knew i was a diabetic they brought me biscuits and gravy
and i was i said to the guy when he was handing it to me i said this is not low carb and i was
like i just want eggs with cheese and bacon like that's all i want i don't want the biscuits in the
gravy and he's like oh well the biscuits see and they're only three grams of carb i was like what
world are you living in right now you know like no just i don't know who typed this sticker up
but no i'm going to tell you right now doctor like this is not three grams of carbs this is like 50
or 60 grams of carbs and it's gonna spike me i'm not eating it and um i had to tell them but still
with my mom she was unconscious they were just giving her this feeding tube which you know that
stuff is terrible and then when she did start eating they were giving her pancakes spaghetti
toast bagels and no matter what i said to them on the phone they just kept doing it and she ended up
with serious lows in the hospital going low with in the hospital's hair how is that even possible
and i know and they're also dosing her after her meal so they're chasing the high which is
very dangerous because the blood sugar will lower on its own you know after it raises so
it's just a very d it seems so contradictory you're supposed to be there and they're supposed
to care for you and you can't trust that anymore you have to be able to advocate for yourself
incredible so um anyway i wanted to say one last thing um and for those of you that are watching
you definitely need to um we can actually give you the right eating plan so i'll put a link
down below and um so this is what i wanted to tell you i stumbled on your blog which is a
fascinating blog it's actually off it's called off the grid what off the grid street and uh
so you basically you have you do videos of like you guys are living i guess it's a farm isn't it
well we're trying to start it you know we're trying it's very slow going again this job has
been such a blessing for our family because i don't have to leave the home to do my job so
that's helping a lot with the progress so right now we're focusing on building our tiny house
um we will get some more chickens and we do want our own farm we want to be able to make our own
food and um be self-sustainable that's our goal so it's been slow going sometimes it gets a little
you know defeating so but we're still pushing forward and i'm so excited that you saw our video
that's so cool oh yeah i was watching all sorts of videos so for those of you watching i want you
to go to that her blog right now put a link down below and subscribe because it's actually pretty
cool very very cool thank you awesome well thanks so much for uh spending the time and
i think you probably have to get back to work right why i got the phone call okay great awesome

i want to talk about the absolute most unhealthy diet in the world hospital foods
i remember i broke my left shoulder i had to get surgery in the hospital and they served me jello
orange juice was 100% orange juice uh yogurt which is sweetened and these little crackers okay
and literally when i woke up from the surgery i was starving so i ate that
and man did that put me in a low blood sugar situation about i don't know half hour later i
my head was hurting i felt sick and i was extremely hungry and craving for sweets hospitals
are a place you go to heal right and recover well it's actually the worst place to go to recover
let's talk about their meals the meals are constructed with
dietary concerns in mind the problem is whoever came up with these dietary concerns needs to be
majorly updated they're because they're operating off of completely false information okay now they
contract out these meals with companies who specialize in preparing institutional foods
okay what are institutional foods well foods that you would maybe serve in prisons maybe the
school system governmental agencies things like that these foods are designed for high volume
low cost they're usually pre-packaged pre-cooked and you just reheat them right the macros
on these foods are typically with the proteins 10 to 35 percent carbs are between 45 and 60 percent
of all the calories being carbohydrates well that's pretty much the same as the sad diet um
the food pyramid 65 of your calories carbohydrates not the best recovery foods in the world that
should be less than 30 percent but you have to make sure that the saturated fats are less than 10
so you know they're using the unsaturated fats soy corn canola oil highly inflammatory so here's some
of the description of the foods uh no trans fats which is good right low sodium that's the common
theme for some reason they have this thing in their mind that sodium is the worst thing
you can possibly consume well guess what when you're healing when your adrenals are stress
when you have high cortisol you're losing sodium and you need more salt salt is very
very important 100 fruit juice right well that's good um it's 100 one percent or
no fat dairy okay the lower the fat that you go with dairy the higher the insulin spike fyi
they use milk substitutes like soy yogurt they recommend less than 30 grams of sugar per 8 ounce
now 30 grams of sugar that's like uh what seven and a half teaspoons of sugar in just that little
bit of yogurt that's crazy amounts of sugar okay we have low sodium cheese whole wheat whole grain
type foods dinner rolls muffins bagels tortilla must contain less than 290 milligrams of sodium
again they're focused on lowering sodium but what about all the carbohydrates terrible
cereal again recommend less than 215 grams of sodium dried cranberries raisins which are
loaded with sugar are not included in the sugar content the canned beef and the canned vegetables
should have low sodium the frozen french toast should have less than 480 milligrams of sodium wow
snacks should be added to help curb hunger what they're missing is that the snacks are
going to spike insulin and you're going to have more inflammation and it's going to make
the person very very hungry and fat and they recommend at least five servings of vegetables
per week not per day per week so this is definitely not recovery food it's inflammatory
foods i highly recommend you do either one of two things you fast when you're in the hospital
or number two you bring your own food so go ahead and comment down below and tell me your experience
uh in the hospital if you've been there recently before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

let's talk about the benefits of fulvic acid now what is fulvic acid
well fulvic acid is actually a byproduct from
microorganisms in the soil it's been used for over 3000 years
in ayurvedic medicine but it's really a catalyst
or a helper compound to allow things to work
number one it helps chelate heavy metals okay so it helps pull out excess amounts
of iron aluminum because they found aluminum
deposits in the plaquing in alzheimer's patients also it's really
good for an autistic child as well because there's
usually higher amounts of aluminum in the brain okay it can help remove
copper now we need copper but if there's excess amounts of copper
it can help to regulate that number two it increases absorption
of other minerals like the good minerals in your body
number three it creates an immune modulation effect so that means it helps
regulate the immune system if there's too much immune system where there's too
much inflammation or not enough it can help bring it to a
normal level number four it can act as a diuretic
which pulls fluid out five it can help regulate
blood pressure number six it's really good for the
microbiome to help with gut health number seven it can decrease the
toxicity of heavy metals as well as country and western that was
a very bad joke but it does pull out these toxic
minerals especially if they're in higher amounts
i mean it's important to get the lead out right and number eight it's a really
good anti-inflammatory so if you wanted some additional data on
the studies done in fulvic acid i put some links down below

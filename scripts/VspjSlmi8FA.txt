all right i have another question for you
does diet regulate your sleep or does sleep regulate your diet let's first take a look at diet
okay there is a very interesting study i'll put the link down below that compares going on a high
carb low fat diet versus going on a low carb high fat diet that's called the ketogenic diet and this
is what they found the group that was on a low carb high fat diet had a significant increase
in n rem sleep what does n rem mean that is non-rem sleep that is the deep
delta wave sleep that's the type of sleep where you burn most of your fat it's a type of sleep
that you wake up and you feel rejuvenated physically now with a high carb low fat diet
you're going to be more deficient in zinc and if you haven't seen my recent video on zinc and sleep
i put that down below very interesting because zinc can greatly influence certain parts of
the brain that control sleep and so if you have a sleeping problem taking zinc before you go to bed
very very very good idea and so with a low carb high fat diet you're not going
to be as deficient in zinc and that's going to help you sleep as well as decrease your
hunger but with a high carb low fat diet you're going to be hungry all the time all right so now
let's ship down to sleep if you have poor sleep both in quality and quantity you will
definitely notice an increase in the desire to eat that means if you don't sleep you're going
to be hungrier so repeat after me poor sleep equals more hunger there's also one study on
poor rem sleep that usually happens in the second half of the night where there's superficial sleep
what happens when you have poor rem sleep is you increase the absorption of glucose which is
going to spike your blood sugars which is going to affect your insulin and that's going to make you
hungry too and not to mention when you're not sleeping well your cortisol is going to go up
and cortisol will release more glucose it'll increase your blood sugars increase insulin
and you're going to have a greater appetite and with higher levels of insulin they're
going to have a heck of a time trying to lose weight you know i was in practice for 30 years
and it was a very very good experience working one-on-one with close to 40 000 different people
over the 30 years and with that experience you see every possible scenario especially with people
struggling with weight when they were focusing on exercising and trying to eat less calories it
wasn't until they got the high quality sleep that helped them lose weight but when you put people
on the ketogenic diet that right there calms the sympathetic nervous system down it helps
lower cortisol it helps increases their sleep it helps them lose more weight they're more satisfied
so it's much easier to lose weight if you're on the ketogenic diet if you're new to my channel
i put the link down below of exactly how to do that so if you're struggling with weight
don't forget about getting better sleep and also i have several recent videos that talk about sleep
check them out i put the links down below hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

so I want to talk about grazing and snacking the two deadly health
destroyers what's the difference between grazing and snacking they're very
similar with snacking you have maybe a certain time you're
gonna snack like between lunch and dinner or you get a snack before you go
to bed so with grazing you pretty much there's
no limit on how much what you eat or when you eat you just constantly eating
and you can see this at like some social activity where they have food around the
house and maybe you're going to the nuts and you're eating this and it's people
are bringing food and you just keep grazing and grazing and grazing if
anyone ever gives you the advice that you should snack to prevent overeating
realize that is the worst advice you can ever give anyone let's just talk about
some of the trouble that someone can get into when they start grazing and
snacking so they start eating the blood Sugar's go up regardless of what they
eat the insulin then goes up after that to push the blood sugar down now they
end up with lower blood sugar now they're hungry so what you have to
realize is that eating causes hunger about one and a half hours later
especially if you're consuming carbohydrates then take a snack
blood Sugar's go up insulin goes up to push the blood sugars down now we have
low blood sugars it's time to eat again and this goes on and on and on problem
is once this becomes chronic now the person starts developing a higher and
higher insulin level and then insulin resistance and all the symptoms that go
with it you have to get up several times a night to urinate tired after eating
craving all the time especially for sweets you have belly fat your blood
sugar goes up your vision starts to go you know brain fog you start getting
inflammation and the list goes on and on and on some people also eat when they're
depressed okay the problem is they might feel better temporarily but then they
become more depressed because as soon as you start raising insulin insulin has a
side effect of causing a lowered emotion depression some people eat to get energy
the problem is the more you do that the more tired you're gonna be because one
of the side effects of high insulin is fatigue some people eat when they're
bored or a stress the problem is the more they do this the more they actually
increase cortisol and the more stressed out they will be and then the very
temporary pleasure that someone gets from eating carbs creates a spike in
dopamine and then they start developing dopamine resistance and then some people
eat carbs for pleasure they spike the dopamine which gives them that nice
sensation which lasts remains and then it goes away so they need more and the
more they do that the more they develop dopamine resistance and then they need
more and more carbohydrate to achieve that effect to the point now where it
doesn't work anymore the more carbs they eat not only are they no longer getting
pleasure from that they're getting pain and inflammation and of course some
people eat just because the food is there it doesn't have to be a reason so
you can see this is definitely a trap I think there's a lot of people don't
realize that when they do fasting and do it correctly what can happen is you can
put your body in a condition where there is absolutely no more hunger and no more
craving in fact you'll feel like you just had a meal because you're eating
you're fat you're eating you're fat all day long and eating your fat generates
ketones and it's a clean fuel you'll feel good you won't have any of this
rollercoaster over here you'll have improved cognitive function focus memory
and you will also have an enhanced mood you won't have that anxiety or
depression you'll feel uplifted if you're new to
fasting this can be achieved if you do it correctly number one and most
importantly do not eat breakfast I was the guy who told people to eat a
breakfast the problem is that I was missing some day
and the data was this when you eat anything it doesn't matter what you ate
if it's protein or fat especially carbs you will stimulate insulin to some
degree the insulin will then drop the blood sugars and it causes more hunger
okay so all night long you're sleeping you're not eating
so you're fasting and then you wake up and you eat and then you start the cycle
over again if you did need consistently what's gonna happen is you'll be able to
tap into your fat fuel and run on that vs. if you eat you won't when you eat
and you stimulate insulin you're gonna inhibit or block your
ability to burn fat and I think a lot of people don't understand that one point
so at the very minimum do not eat a breakfast many people are not hungry yet
they still eat a breakfast that's a big mistake
if you are hungry for breakfast all that means is the day before you ate too many
carbs what you want to do is you want to avoid carbs when you eat which is gonna
then make it easier to do fasting versus consuming a carbohydrate with a meal and
trying to do fasting because of this carbohydrates trigger insulin which then
makes you hungry and eating stimulates insulin which then makes you hungry both
of those actions number two eating causes hunger about one and a half hours
after you eat number three this is for people that are addicted to grazing and
snacking you must not buy any more junk food get the junk out of the trunk
because if it's available you're gonna eat it you just don't bring it in the
house you have to talk to your family and get them not to buy it as well make
it difficult to get and just make it so it's not available
number four stay as active as you possibly can do a lot of exercise get
out of the house do other things and number five I already talked about this
avoid carbs when you eat if you haven't seen my video on the technique to avoid
eating bread you might want to check that out I
put it up right here

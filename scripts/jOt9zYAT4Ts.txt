let's talk about what foods you need to avoid if you have herpes type 1 and type 2. so let's say
you have a cold sore around your mouth or inside your mouth or you have genital herpes same foods
to avoid what you're trying to avoid are foods high in arginine which is an amino acid and you
want to eat foods that are high in l-lysine when you have arginine that blocks l-lysine
l-lysine can put this virus into emission now this virus can be triggered by too much stress
too much sun and a low immune system but what's fascinating about this virus is that 95% of the
adult population has this virus so you can go in remission out of remission depending on various
factors so these are the top foods that you need to avoid all nuts all seeds all berries grains
beans tofu gelatin and eggs these are the foods that you can eat fish seafood chicken
beef lamb cheese veggies and sprouts now let's say for example you're in a situation where you
need to have nuts seeds berries etc then just make sure you take l-lysine at the same time
because that will actually greatly help you it's an amino acid you can get it i would recommend
3000 milligrams if it's intense and you want to get rid of it fairly a to b
but as a preventative you can take a lot smaller amounts whatever's indicated or directed on the
supplement that you buy hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof
your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you

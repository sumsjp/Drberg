so I got this question the other day will consuming coconut oil raise my
cholesterol so let's just talk about it the answer is yes it might but who cares
there is absolutely no research anywhere that shows any negative aspects of
consuming coconut oil on your heart there's no data that shows that even if
your cholesterol goes up from coconut oil that you're going to have a heart
attack or any risk factor at all for having a heart problem now if you happen
to see a study make sure you read it because it'll be on mice and they will
also have something else in the diet which is usually glucose or sucrose
which is sugar but if you're actually just talking about coconut oil
you're not going to increase the risk for heart problems at all okay so here's
the thing when you consume coconut oil there's fat in there okay it may
temporarily increase your cholesterol but here's a key point it's not about
the total cholesterol it's usually about the LDL okay low-density lipoprotein
they call this the bad cholesterol well here's the thing there is two types of
LDL one is the small dense particles and the other version is the large buoyant
particles which are they float and what determines if you have the small dense
particles which can invade the wall of the artery and create a lot of
inflammation and problem has to do not with your coconut oil or cholesterol or
fat it has to do with your carbs if your carbs are high the LDL type you'll have
is a small dense okay if you don't have these refined carbs so you go low-carb
you may have high LDL but it'll be the large buoyant type LDL a simple test to
do would be to get an advanced lipid profile test and determine what type of
LDL you have then you'll know for sure but because coconut oil has certain fats
that are called medium chain triglycerides okay typically what
happens is your triglycerides will go down your good cholesterol your HDL will
go up and the most important thing is your insulin will come down you'll
improve that condition called insulin resistance
you'll make insulin more sensitive so it can work better and because of that
you're going to not end up with small dense low-density lipoproteins okay it's
not going to affect the heart what's really behind the damaging effect of the
heart is the insulin and that comes from carbs not fat I hope I explained that
very simply but when you really understand that there's two different
types of LDL then it makes a lot of sense alright thanks for watching so I
just spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how to
bulletproof your immune system and there's 21 different lessons and I want
to give you this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is
sometimes people don't value it as much but I want to get it out there so I'm
just going to give it to you free and I want to let you know that it's extremely
extremely valuable right now we're in a situation of uncertainty they're talking
about a second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that
maybe say who knows it's all unknown so what is the big elephant in the room no
one is talking about the immune system they're not emphasizing the most
important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and
bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I'm going
to teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you
can do to strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements
number one I want you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands
of people had this information to protect themselves but not only that
getting rid of the fear factor which I believe is worse than the virus I mean
when you think about it it's very similar to someone being bullied in
school as soon as they learn self-defense they're gonna be less
adversely affected by these bullies so why not give you the
information on your immune system so you know what to do to protect yourself you
see a lot of people that are scared I see them on exercise like in in the park
they're wearing a mask while they're exercising or walking by themselves or
in a car they're wearing a mask and a shield so please share this course with
everyone you know if you want to help someone this is the best way to help
them to give them the knowledge of how to strengthen your immune system we want
this to go viral in a healthy way all right number two be active on your
course and actually complete the course okay take your time really learn the
information there's questions that you're gonna have to answer but stick
with it but number three Semmy your success when you complete the course and
sometimes when I talk to people they end the conversation with be safe and I
thought to myself what does that mean be safe well wear the mask and also avoid
getting too close to people right well that's cool but what about strengthening
the immune system that way you could be not just safe but you could be very very
smart because the missing link is a strong immune system that gives you the
ultimate protection I really believe that the best thing that we can do both
you and I to help people is to spread this out and get everyone to know this
information and here's what I came up with for the top three people that share
this course with the most people I'm gonna give them a one-hour one-on-one
video consult with dr. Berg myself and we can talk about anything or your
health or whatever and then for the top 100 people that share this course I'm
gonna give this group video accidents to a very special webinar that's going to
be live on a topic that I can't necessarily do in a YouTube video
because it'll be taken down but just realize it's going to be some very
powerful information that you're gonna learn that's going to really help you
and people around you sorry to give you that mystery but unfortunately social
media is filtering out certain topics right now
and the top 100 will also get access to my virtual keto summit at the end of
August last point do you get access to this information you have to have
messenger now some of you don't use messenger and unfortunately everything
is set up a messenger so I would recommend signing up a messenger and if
you don't want to continue use it after the course just opt-out I think you're
really going to enjoy this course I put a lot of time into it the information is
down below and spread the word

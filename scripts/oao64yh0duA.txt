now if you have the correct pattern of intermittent fasting you can actually tap into
your visceral fat that's the fat around the organs it's the fat that spills off from your liver
because when the liver gets fatty it starts to dump fat around the organs and you develop
belly fat now there was a study recently done on mice that indicated that when you do intermittent
fasting it actually can slow down your weight loss and creates a resistance trying to lose weight
so basically they indicated that intermittent fasting slows your ability to lose belly fat okay
now this was in the news it was put out there to discourage people from doing intermittent fasting
now this conflicts with other studies that shows that doing intermittent fasting does work
uh one i'll put down below which shows that you can reduce your visceral fat the stuff around
your belly by four to seven percent by doing one meal a day so when we have conflicting information
you have two facts that oppose each other and obviously one can't be a fact based on evidence
one has to be false right all right so when you start digging into the first study i mentioned
um they did what's called every other day fasting where you would fast one day go back to your
regular eating plan the next day and then fast the next day to me that really is going on and
off keto okay and yes you are fasting every other day but you're omitting the keto diet you're just
eating your regular foods every other day so this is a lot different than doing the recommended
intermittent fasting that i talk about where you're fast for a period of hours then you
go on keto and then you fast for a period of hours and you keep going back and forth
the key is staying on keto so there's two types of fasting that i think would really slow your
weight loss down one is the every other day fasting and the other is the five and two
so five days let's say monday through friday you what you want and then for two days you're fasting
but you're really not fasting you're eating 500 calories who knows if it's keto or not but the
point is that you're not actually combining keto with fasting you're combining your regular diet
with fasting and what's going to happen is this the more you go on and off keto where
you're adding carbs and you're taking them away it's going to cause the body to adapt and protect
its fuel source which is stored as body fat so it's very similar to what happens when you
go on and off a diet you start creating insulin resistance and your metabolism starts slowing down
more and more and more so if you really want to correct your metabolism and really target visceral
fat the absolute best way to do it is to do it with the combination of intermittent fasting and
keto at the same time if you're new to my channel i put a link down below of exactly how to do this

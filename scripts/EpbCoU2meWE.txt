hey guys had a question could you be in ketosis with negative ketones on urine tough so you do
the keto stick or the keto strip and it comes out negative the question is could you still be
in ketosis we'll talk about that first you need to know there are 3 different types of ketones
acetate acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate okay but the one to keep this specific ketone
that's tested only on urine test is acetoacetate okay so it doesn't really check these other ones
right here so the problem is not the problem but what happens over time as you key to adapt and you
convert more from sugar burning to fat burning you convert this one to this one right here
beta-hydroxybutyrate so you're converting more of this less of this so it may not show up on a
urine test all right because your body's more efficient because when you're measuring ketones
you're just measuring the excess of ketones from the urine okay it doesn't really tell you what's
happening in the blood or other places this is the excess that's spilling over but when you're using
those in fuel and adapt it's not going to show up necessarily alright that's one thing so if you
wanted to check this you could get a blood test the problem is it's a bit expensive so yes you can
actually show negative nothing shows up like zero ketones but doesn't necessarily mean you're not
in ketosis look for other factors are you losing weight inches lost are you feeling good okay and
if your carbohydrates are 20 grams per day net carbs or less you're going to be in ketosis okay
but anyway I want to do a video not just to clear up the confusion so let me know what you think put
your comments down below hey guys the quick survey question I want to know what topic you would like
me to do a video on so each week I'm coming up with different types of videos but I would
rather have you tell me what you're interested in so I put a link down below please fill it out

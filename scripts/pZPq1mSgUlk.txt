so let's talk about the first sign or symptom
that usually occurs if you're low in vitamin d
it is low back ache but i really want to emphasize this because this is
so powerful if you have low back pain and you're getting all these treatments
when you're deficient and you're not taking enough vitamin d
you're going to be in a long program before you get any relief
so let's talk about the relationship between vitamin d and your lower back
vitamin d is necessary for your immune system
it's necessary to help regulate blood pressure to keep
keep it on the low side it's also important sleep
and your mood but it's vitally important as an anti-inflammatory and to help you
get rid of pain one of the first signs of low vitamin d
is the achiness in your lumbar spine especially
at night so really good demonstration to see if
you fit in this category is simply to squat down and
get up from a squatted position or even from a seated position and stand up and
rate your difficulty then you would take 40 000 ius of
vitamin d3 and wait about an hour and then re-rate
your difficulty from a squatted position or
see the position standing up and you should see a significant improvement if
this is your problem now most people if they're very
deficient will notice a change within about an hour
but if some people are are so deficient it could take
a day or two before they see the results so sometimes you might want to wait a
little bit longer to really know that it's working
so low back pain or achiness especially at night hard time getting
out from a seated position or from a squatted position what happens
is that from the lower back it kind of spreads to the pelvis
kind of all over stiff achy pain then it goes into the hip
joints okay and then it goes into the upper
legs the thigh muscles uh usually symmetrical both of them at
the same time it then can go into the upper arms as
well it usually affects the proximal muscles
which are the muscles that are closest to the
midline or the trunk it can also cause bone pain of the ribs especially when
you press on either your shin the front part of your
lower leg or your breastbone right through and here that could be one
indication that you're deficient also vitamin d affects the muscle tone
so you may find that your gait you're waddling back and forth
if you ever see people like kind of rocking back and forth as they're
walking just go up to them and recommend vitamin
d vitamin d is in cod liver oil
fatty fish eggs and dairy but it's almost impossible for you
to get your vitamin d from your diet you need to get it from the sun and if
you can't get it from the sun take it as a supplement i'm going to
recommend if you have these symptoms 40 000 iu's
vitamin d3 it might be good to take it with a meal

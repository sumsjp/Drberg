had someone ask me a question is it safe for an older person to do fasting and the answer is no
if you get over 50 it's absolutely not safe in fact it's very very dangerous if you fast over the
age of 50. and i'm being very very sarcastic it's not only safe it is vital it is essential that the
older you get the more you should focus on doing fasting and intermittent fasting why because it
will extend your life a lot of research has been done on animal studies even insects even bacteria
if you restrict the frequent eating they live longer and because of all the massive benefits
of fasting it can definitely extend your life as well it activates anti-aging genes it can help rid
so many health problems that occur when you get older obesity inflammation high blood pressure
dementia and the biggest thing that fasting can do for someone that's older is repair dna repair
mitochondria repair through what's called autophagy autophagy is a condition in your
body it's a natural condition that occurs when you fast and what occurs is your body recycles
old damaged proteins and microbes and from even the standpoint of cancer cancer comes
from damaged mitochondria and the more you can get rid of and recycle damaged mitochondria the
less risk you have for cancer and autophagy does just that it will actually get rid of damaged
tissue that your body doesn't need and cancer is on the top 10 list of things that kill people
and so is heart disease so fasting is great for the heart because it will increase ketones
and your heart and your brain love ketones way more than glucose fuel and so fasting helps
repair heart tissue and brain tissue when you fast you stimulate something called bdnf brain derived
neurotrophic factor which is kind of like miracle growth for the brain so you regenerate neurons in
certain parts of your brain and the other thing that fasting does is it increases your antioxidant
network your body starts making massive quantities of antioxidants which you need to reduce free
radical damage to your dna and also to repair the lining of the vessels in the heart and so
there is no good reason to eat frequently there is no good reason to not fast especially as you age

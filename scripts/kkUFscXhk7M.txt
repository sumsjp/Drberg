you don't have to suffer anymore no sir
you can eat junk food made by me and
that rhymed
uh-huh okay let's start
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
again so uh we're still working on the
mug cake theme and I like it because
it's a small recipe recie perfectly
proportioned for just a small number of
bites of or a small person or a really
small person so um this one is the
cinnamon roll and
um it's good let's let's let's taste
it surprisingly good it's good and it
reminds me of actually a
Cinnabon of a Cinnabon but it actually
kind of reminds me of a of a panc
pancake it does it tastes like a pancake
um so you could get creative with these
I guess they're good but the the great
thing about him is it's a a treat you
just pop in your mouth and be done with
it and you're not committed to an entire
piece of cake which is
always more than someone should be
eating and even the mug cake recipe I
mean all eight of these were one mug
cake you know do you want to eat an
entire mug of cake well maybe you do but
anyway this this is a great way to
perfect bite size Papa snack yeah you
have to make this recipe so let's just
show you how to make it I might have
them for breakfast too

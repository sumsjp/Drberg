do a quick video on the best foods for keto flu now keto flu is not an actual flu it's not an
actual infection but you might feel like you have the flu lethargy weak achy brain fog nauseousness
and headaches alright so what are the best foods anything salty make sure you use sea salt
bone broth is really good make sure you dump a lot of salt in there and number three
foods that are high in potassium so in reality keto flu is a deficiency of either sodium
or potassium or other electrolytes so this is why when you start keto and you're doing intermittent
fasting one or two of your meals should include a large salad but add a lot of sea salt to your
salad that way you have the potassium and the greens and you have the sea salt to counter the
deficiency of sodium that might occur when you start to go into ketosis and that is because when
you go from a high carb to a low carb you're going to release a lot of fluids and with that comes a
loss of electrolytes not just potassium magnesium things like that but sodium and chloride now the
other thing that i try to include in my diet is more avocados avocados are loaded with potassium
and i always add a good amount of sea salt to get the full spectrum of those electrolytes
all right that's your quick video on keto flu hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

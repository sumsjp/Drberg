so I know you've heard that high-fat diets are bad for you they're very
dangerous but in reality high-fat diets are only dangerous if you are combining
them with sugar okay there's a term I want to introduce you to it's called
glycation okay what is glycation what's happening
is you're bonding sugar to a fat or protein so when you consume sugar with
protein or sugar with fat you create this glycation as in deep-fried french
fries barbecue ribs doughnuts so you're combining a carbohydrate with
sugar meat with sugar you know pure carbohydrate with fat and you cook it
you create AGEs advanced glycation end-products now what is that that is a
compound that gives you very sticky proteins okay they stiffen things they
make the arteries stiffer they clog things up they create inflammation they
age the body they're involved in many degenerative diseases as in diabetes
liver disease Alzheimer's heart disease kidney disease now the two things I can
create this effect are the combination of sugar with either protein of fat when
it's cooked when you consume it or if you're consuming these separately at the
same time the body heat will create that situation so if you avoid sugar you have
nothing to worry about hey if you're liking this content please

so what is coq10 good for i'm talking about coenzyme q10 now what is a coenzyme it's something
that helps an enzyme and there's a lot of different enzymes in the body that go way beyond
just digestion there are enzymes that help perform many different functions there are proteins
that are involved in all the biochemical pathways in the body for making energy to making hormones
to helping you detoxify poisonous chemicals now coq10 is found in every single cell in your body
it's an extremely powerful antioxidant but its main job is to stabilize membranes membranes
are outer coverings of certain things like your cell membranes have this outer fat layer very
very important in holding the um the voltage of the cell because it sells like a battery without
that membrane you would be able to hold the voltage so it's it's a very key part of all cells
also the membrane around the mitochondria which is energy factory needs coq10 to help transport
electrons through this process into atp which is the energy currency of the body
all the lipoprotein membranes need coenzyme q10 as in hdl ldl and these are just proteins that
carry cholesterol through the body and then back from the body back to the liver so coq10 helps
stabilize membranes especially in areas of your body which you're generating a lot of energy okay
as in the heart the brain the kidney the liver and your muscles so we need coenzyme q10 because if
you're generating a lot of energy you're also generating a lot of free radical damage and
oxidation so coq10 helps to counter that now here's the thing when someone takes a statin
they completely block coq10 and if you're going to block this enzyme you're going to create a lot of
side effects especially muscle damage okay so if you're on a statin you need to be taking coq10
also if you have any nutritional deficiencies you're going to be deficient in coq10 because that
sets you up for not creating coq10 in the first place if you have inflammatory conditions and
there's many different kinds autoimmune it's like ms diabetes you're going to need coq10 so coq10
can help any type of heart condition it's good for athletes that generate a lot of oxidation it's
good for people that have migraines and headaches it's good for anyone that has chronic inflammation
if you're taking a lot of medication it's good to take and also it's good to prevent cancer because
cancer results from a lot of damage to your dna and so if you're taking coq10 you can actually
help prevent some of that damage hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to

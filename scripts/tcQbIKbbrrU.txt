let's talk about why you should actually
sweat more often
did you realize that we spend over 75
billion dollars a year just to block
sweat for some reason people don't like
to sweat they don't like the smell
and above all don't let anyone know that
you actually sweat now sweat itself
doesn't have a bad odor it's the
bacteria that
ferment certain things in the sweat that
produce various types of odor and a lot
of times when you're using certain
deodorants that plug up your pores
that sweat material gets blocked and it
ferments more and it can create a worse
odor but there are two types of sweat
glands you have
certain glands that produce an oil that
is connected with a hair follicle like
underneath your armpit and then you have
other sweat glands that produce more of
a
salty uh fluid but the overall purpose
of sweat is your body's strategy to
control
temperature to dump heat so you can keep
moving and you prevent heat stroke
it's a survival strategy and we can lose
a lot of sweat in fact we can lose
between two and four liters of sweat
every single hour that's an incredible
amount of fluid coming out of our body
and when people are in fear
or under major stress when they're
sweating it has a completely different
odor now if we look at the consistency
of sweat what's in it
you have
0.9 grams it's like almost 1 gram per
liter of sodium so there's a lot of
sodium and if we look at potassium it's
only 0.2 grams per liters and then if we
look at calcium it's even less
0.015 grams per liter and then magnesium
is 0.013 grams per liter then there's a
lot of other things in sweat you have
chloride you have fatty acids you have
even glucose proteins so sweat is really
the same chemistry as the
fluid that you have in your blood minus
the red blood cells
and the fluid that is in between your
cells and the capillaries okay so it's a
salty fluid
and in your sweat glands you even
actually recycle some of these minerals
as well but this is what you need to
know an average person
consumes
about 3 300 milligrams of sodium every
single day okay
and they consume about 2600 milligrams
of potassium every day now if we compare
this to what our bodies really need okay
let's just take sodium for example so an
average person actually needs
less than what they're getting they need
about 2300 milligrams okay
and they're getting 3 300 milligrams so
they're basically getting an extra 1000
milligrams of sodium every single day
now potassium
they need 4700 which is a lot more than
what they actually get so an average
person is in the negative with potassium
by
2100 milligrams and only five percent of
the population even gets 4 700
milligrams of potassium every single day
so the ratios are just way more
important than these individual numbers
so for example if you're not getting
enough potassium well just make sure you
don't consume a lot of sodium but if you
consume more sodium make sure that
you're getting a lot more potassium at
least twice as much or even three times
as much potassium as the sodium now
there's all sorts of studies on this and
i will put those links down below but
especially for the cardiovascular
system you need these ratios to be
correct and this is the exact reason i
came up with my electrolyte powder very
heavy in the potassium
low on the sodium to help correct this
imbalance
now here's some benefits of sweating
okay number one you're going to balance
out your sodium to potassium ratios
because an average person like i said is
heavy on the sodium and the low on the
potassium so when they're sweating
they're going to be losing much more
sodium than potassium so just by
sweating you can correct this in balance
right here and support a healthy
cardiovascular system all right number
two you can release certain toxins the
ones that are in your blood just realize
that you're going to be also losing
the good stuff as well but you will
release some toxins if they're in your
blood number three you're going to sleep
better people notice when they sweat
especially when they exercise
they sleep better that night now it
could be the exercise that helps them
sleep but just the fact that you're
balancing these ratios right here are
going to help the cardiovascular system
you'll breathe better you'll have better
circulation and you will sleep better
all right number four more energy
now this really depends because
if you get more sleep you're gonna have
more energy right if you have an
imbalance of sodium and potassium okay
and you balance that out you're gonna
have more energy but if you're losing
too many electrolytes especially
sodium okay
you're going to feel fatigued so when
you sweat and you don't replace the
sodium you may have more fatigue however
this all depends on the quantity of
exercise and if you're replacing your
electrolytes at the same time number
five it can actually increase your
circulation and prevent overheating now
just think about this as you're sweating
you're pushing out
certain fluids right it's very very good
for your skin it's good for circulation
because we're pushing things out and
hopefully you're taking things back in
versus inactivity no sweating when your
fluids are not circulating through the
body they're stagnant and you're going
to get less circulation all right number
six sweating creates a harmonic effect
what does that mean it means that it
creates a certain stress that causes
your body to adapt and actually become
stronger especially for the neurons in
your brain and there's one study that i
found that i'll put the link down below
that shows that sweating actually helps
to maintain your brain cells which is
pretty interesting and number seven okay
the support of your adrenal glands
your adrenal glands have a huge control
over sodium and potassium and if you
have an imbalance and you sweat you can
put these two minerals back into balance
and support the adrenals now of course
this is also a conditional because if
you're losing too much sodium or even
losing too much potassium that can
negatively affect your adrenals but
usually the fact that when someone
sweats they're usually exercising and
exercise does support the adrenals as
long as you recover but yesterday i cut
the lawn and it was hot outside and i
sweat like a pig and the sweat was just
coming out of my body it was getting in
my eyes it was salty and i came inside i
took a shower and boy did i feel better
the rest of the day and i slept great
that night now i think the best next
video for you to watch would be the one
on exercise the unique benefits of
exercise check it out i put it right
here
you

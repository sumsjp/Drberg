i wanted to talk about all the problems with chronic inflammation and there's quite a few
let's start with the artery okay the inside of the artery has this little lining of
cells called the endothelial cells and when you expose that layer of the inside of your artery
to things that cause inflammation or oxidation or free radical damage like sugar having a high
sugar level or omega-6 oils especially or other things like tobacco smoke or alcohol whatever
you create irritation you create chronic inflammation and from that condition you
can get a clot because the proteins start to get become sticky you can then get a stroke or heart
attack and this also makes the artery thicker and more rigid leading to high blood pressure
also the inflammation on the inside of the artery causes a healing effect where the
body comes in with a band-aid with cholesterol with calcium and scar tissue okay so then you
get an atherosclerotic plaque that can build up in the artery and also cause a heart attack
one really really good thing to prevent and reverse this is get on the healthy ketogenic diet
and do intermittent fasting okay and also take something called tocotrienols which is a type of
vitamin e that's very powerful to help heal and protect the inside of the artery from becoming
damaged and inflamed also omega-3 fatty acids like cod liver oil or fish oils are very very important
now let's go to asthma which is a condition where your lungs are involved there's inflammation
vitamin d3 is the best antidote for that this is why kids with asthma if they're on the sun
find great relief with breathing if they have asthma now arthritis there's two major types i
want to talk about number one is the degenerative joint disease where you just have wear and tear on
the in the joints and the inflammation that can develop from that is just from irritation in the
joints because you lost collagen cartilage connective tissue one of the best remedies
for that that i found is stinging nettle root and it seems to work really good for that condition
shifting gears an autoimmune condition there's quite a few where your body is attacking itself
creating inflammation this usually starts in the gut there's also usually stress involved
i found personally there's a link between a major loss which shocks the adrenal system
and the immune system and allows this condition to progress one of the best remedies for this would
be getting on a low carb diet the healthy keto diet and regular intermittent fasting and a lot
of vitamin d for this condition many times you need to do higher amounts of vitamin d
starting with like 30 or 40,000 IUs of vitamin d on a regular basis and this seems to
greatly improve this condition because vitamin d3 is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories
all right next point is stress that activates cortisol to the point where you either have a
cortisol resistant situation where even though there's a lot of cortisol going through your
body which normally is anti-inflammatory it doesn't work because the receptors are downgraded
so it's ineffective or it's a situation where you have a low amount of cortisol because the
adrenals are burnt out as in addison's disease in this situation one of the best remedies is
to support the adrenal directly as well as take vitamin d3 vitamin d3 is not really even a vitamin
it is a hormone and it acts like cortisol but without the side effects so cortisol really is
an anti-inflammatory but if it's not working you get inflammation just think about any condition
any medical condition involving inflammation whether it's just from having an autoimmune
disease or some skin problem or pain in your back what do they use prednisone what's prednisone
it's a synthetic version of cortisol all right so shifting gears now we have diabetes which is
a state of high blood sugars which creates a lot of inflammation in the body and this is because
high levels of sugar in the blood act like steel wool or sandpaper to the inside of the arteries
the inside of the kidneys on the nerves in the eyes and it creates inflammation
what is the best antidote well reducing the carbohydrates and reducing the sugar in the diet
and doing intermittent fasting all right next point is just
junk food in general okay refined foods what's lacking refined foods is the antioxidants
okay and the nutrients that act like antioxidants that then allow more oxidation and free radicals
to create more damage in your dna and the tissues and so you just need to avoid refined foods and
eat foods high in nutrients and naturally high in antioxidants all right next point would be
infections let's say you had some bacterial infection that you have a tooth infection
that can create inflammation in different places in your body even in your heart
which is actually quite fascinating and in your joints there are people that have arthritis
that's all stemming from a tooth infection okay i've done a video on this and you can check it
out people that have chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia usually have some type of
infection in their body it could be either virus like an epstein-barr virus or it could be lyme
or it can be some other virus that is going in remission in outer emission triggered by stress
or age or whatever the best remedy for this is to reduce your stress as much as possible and take
things that are anti-microbial like garlic oregano thyme and herbs that actually can
put these viruses back into remission i've done videos on that i'll put a link down
below now let's talk about cancer which is an interesting topic in relationship to inflammation
cancer tends to follow inflammation it tends to go into areas of your body that are inflamed this
is why cancer tends to show up in areas of old injury which is very interesting i've done a video
on this and so there's definitely associations between inflammation and cancer increased risk
of getting cancer with high levels of inflammation probably because it's connected with higher levels
of maybe viruses or carcinogens or damage in the body does inflammation directly cause cancer
we're not sure it could but we don't know yet but we do know there are carcinogens
and there's also anti-cancer foods there are certain things in foods especially phytonutrients
for example that have powerful anti-cancer effects that can help you prevent cancer
and then if you have cancer it can actually help you kill cancer too
i've done videos on this the other very important thing to do if you have cancer is fasting
fasting probably has the most potent effect over cancer of anything because when you fast
you turn on all sorts of anti-cancer genes and you can even put a cancer gene that's active
into an inactive state when you do fasting and fasting directly has a potent effect
over chronic inflammation if you're new to my channel and you want more information about that
check out the video down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why
here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system
i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today you

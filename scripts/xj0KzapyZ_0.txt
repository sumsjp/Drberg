hi guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to share with you the real cause of
gallstones now a lot of times when you go to the doctor if you have gallstones
they're going to just remove the gallbladder without explaining what
caused them in the first place right well gallstones are really cholesterol
stones and it's not caused by consuming too much cholesterol it's caused because
you don't have enough bile to break down the cholesterol stones so what is bile
bile is made by the liver it's stored in the gallbladder that is just the sack to
help you dissolve fats in your diet okay so I'm going to I'm going to demonstrate
this so here we have a little container of fat okay this is oil this is like you
just ate some fatty foods right and here we have detergent this is the bile so if
we mix the detergent with the oil don't try this at home
okay and this is what the gallbladder does okay you just shake a little bit
well look at that so basically the detergent dissolved the oil into small
particles that's called a multiplication okay so the bile dissolves the fat and
then the pancreas over here underneath your left ribcage sends another thing in
there called lipase that's an enzyme for fats that takes it one step further and
dissolves it into real small particles so you can start absorbing it to the
intestines or the liver okay but basically the gallbladder breaks down
fats and so we need bile but really a low bile problem is a is the symptom of
something else so it could be either a symptom of excess estrogen and that's
why women they go through pregnancy or they have high levels of estrogen can
get gall stones as well or if they're taking birth control pills or if they're
taking hormone replacement therapy right excessive cortisol can also cause gall
stones that's stress excessive insulin can cause gall stones as well
because it depletes the bile reserve and that's why a lot of diabetics get golf
stones right well it's an estrogen I'm sorry it's an insulin problem too much
insulin depletes the bile low fatty diets can also cause about efficiency
why because the thing that triggers the release of bile is saturated fats so if
you don't eat enough fats especially saturated fats your body is just not
going to make the bile and then you're going to have a less amount and you
could get gallstones from that constipation could also be another cause
because it backs up the whole thing but then also it could go low bile can cause
constipation because by lubricates the colon so it could be a little bit of a
you know the chicken of the egg we don't know which one it is so those are some
simple solutions so how do we dissolve the stones well you take you increase
your bile you figure out which one this is you correct the diet if it's too much
sugar too much stress too much estrogen you correct that in the meantime you can
dissolve the stone by taking the bile salt
it's a concentrate the one that I use is called gall bladder formula and it not
only has purified bile salts but it has stone root which is an herb that
dissolves stones plus I added in there a bunch of enzymes and acidify errs to
really help the stomach release your own bile so you can actually produce more
okay so if you're interested check the link below okay in summary you want to
know the cause of your gall stones so you can actually prevent a problem down
the road so even if they remove the gall bladder
the cause is still there it can create liver stones in fact so you may not have
a gallstone but now you get a liver stone alright well thanks for watching

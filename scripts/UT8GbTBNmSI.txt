i recently did a video on a very amazing gene the nrf2 which is like a gene that protects you
against disease and especially cancer i found some additional interesting data on this that
i want to share with you but if you haven't seen the first video watch that first i'm going to put
a link down below of exactly what it does but this gene is like the the master gene that activates
hundreds of other genes that protect your cells and these other genes are related to antioxidants
because your body has networks of antioxidants so antioxidants don't just come from external sources
from your food your body makes them so they come from within and the term for that is endogenous
so this gene regulates endogenous antioxidants as well as the detoxification genes which helps
break down things that cause cancer like chemicals in the environment we call those
carcinogens so this gene protects against trauma emotional stress pollution toxins
uv radiation and also the free radical damage that comes from having nutritional deficiencies so it's
a very very important gene in the other video i talked about people having an over expression of
this gene and these are the type of people that pretty much can eat what they want
smoke every day drink and live to be 99 years old right yet everyone else has a normal expression
of this gene which makes them prone to develop diseases and cancer so the question is what
can you do about it there's something called epigenetics which means above genetics so what i
want to talk about is some of the things that you can do on an epigenetic level to get an advantage
of having more expression of this gene now again this gene acts as a switch that tells the cell
that oxidative damage is occurring and then it turns on the body's defense mechanisms
by activating genes that help the cell produce protective antioxidant molecules so here are
the pro nrf2 compounds number one curcumin from turmeric number two sulfurophane from cruciferous
vegetables of course number three kercetin from onions green tea and there's quite a few other
vegetables that have this compound present as well and number four a phytonutrient called fisetin
which is in strawberries onions cucumbers and there are two other things that are not going
to be a big surprise but regular mild to moderate exercise will enhance the expression of this gene
and this is definitely no surprise but fasting can increase the expression of this gene by 1.5
to 5 times the normal expression so i think out of all the things you can really do man fasting hands
down is the probably the most important thing to focus on so if you're new to my channel and you
want more information click the link down below and start doing intermittent fasting on a regular
basis hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content i would
love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

now if you have a thyroid problem this video is going to be very very important to you
the first thing you need to know is that most thyroid conditions both hyper and hypo involved
auto immune thyroid disease in other words ninety percent of hypothyroid conditions
are an autoimmune condition called hashimoto's and seventy percent of the hyperthyroid conditions
are graves disease which is another autoimmune disease and so now let's talk about the
relationship between gluten and the thyroid because gluten creates celiac which is an
inflammatory condition which destroys a little villi the little roots of the intestine which
then allow the proteins to invade the lymphatic system and the immune system and now you have
these antibodies that attack this protein and so gluten is a protein it's the protein of certain
grains especially wheat rye barley and others but gluten in the digestive system turns into
gliadin and the protein gliadin looks very very similar if not certain parts of it identical
to something in your thyroid which is an enzyme called transglutaminase so if you have antibodies
that are attacking this protein in wheat anytime you consume grains these antibodies are going to
not just attack that protein it's going to attack the thyroid as well simply because of
this molecular mimicry situation and there's a lot of other autoimmune conditions that have a
similar type principle where you have this mimicry of either a virus or a food that mimics
a body tissue but in the case of the thyroid whether you have a hyper or hypo
you definitely need to remove gluten from the diet 100% because every time you consume it your body's
going to look at that as a foreign invader and it's going to actually attack that with
its antibodies as well as certain parts of your thyroid creating this inflammatory state all right
there are five things that i'm going to recommend number one you have to be completely gluten free
number two you want to get on keto the healthy version of keto and intermittent fasting why
because it's going to lower your inflammation next thing you want to take is selenium
selenium is essential for autoimmune conditions especially with the thyroid whether you have a
hyper or a hypothyroid condition the big thing you need to be aware of with a hyper thyroid condition
graves is that you want to avoid taking iodine because your thyroid is already producing too
many thyroid hormones and those thyroid hormones are made from iodine the other thing you want
to avoid is bile salts because bile salts will increase the conversion from the inactive form
t4 to the active form t3 but if you have a hypo thyroid condition you definitely want to take
purified bowel salts and that would be oxbile or any of the bile supplements that are out there
so selenium is good for hyper and hypo next thing you want to do is take vitamin d3 minimally 10,000
ius why because vitamin d can help you with your inflammation it's one of the best natural
anti-inflammatory vitamins out there and the last thing to take is probiotics simply because
most autoimmune conditions start in the gut because you want to start building up that weak
link in your gut alright thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my

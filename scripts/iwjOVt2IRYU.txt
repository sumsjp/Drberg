so i wanted to cover some interesting things about fasting one is that fasting will increase
your motivation exercise i'm going to cover that but i also want to talk about something very
very important and it basically has to do with hunger waves okay you want to ignore hunger waves
now what is a hunger wave well it's a wave of hunger that if you ignore it it will go away
what's causing the hunger is a hormone and it's called ghrelin okay ghrelin is the hunger hormone
and it sends signals to the brain telling you it's time to eat and let's say for example it's
lunchtime and you're getting hungry and you just ignore it you get busy whatever within two hours
you're gonna find it's gone you're not hungry anymore okay then at dinner time it might come
up again if you ignore it push through it it goes away so over time when you fast you have these
waves of ghrelin up and down up and down but over time they go further and further
downward to the point where it becomes easier and easier to fast where you don't have that sensation
of hunger anymore so you have two things you have one is the sensation of hunger and number two you
have wow my blood sugars have dropped i'm really hungry i'm feeling irritable i'm getting weak i'm
getting dizzy well that means that you need to eat but that's a lot different than a temporary
wave of hunger caused by ghrelin fasting over a period of time will make you less and less
hungry it's very counter-intuitive you would think that not eating will make you hungry it doesn't
and eating especially repetitive eating makes you more hungry every time you eat you spike insulin
and two hours later now you're hungry and you need a little snack so related to that information
try to ignore the hunger signals right now and fast longer now i want to switch gears
to something else very interesting and this was based on a study involving mice okay not humans
but i find it to be true in humans there was an increased urge to exercise when fasting and they
isolated that down to the same hormone ghrelin so ghrelin can actually make you want to exercise
what i want to know is if you've been fasting for a period of time go ahead and put down in the
comments section down below if you find that when you fast you do have this increased motivation
exercise so if you get this spike in ghrelin and you're hungry ignore those signals but don't
ignore the signals to exercise hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

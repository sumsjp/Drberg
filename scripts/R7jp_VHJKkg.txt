so let's talk about the best food to pevent pops okay what is a polyp well
it's an abnormal tissue and I'm going to teach you a new word pedunculated
okay pedunculated means that it has a little bit of a stem growing off of
something like in your colon you have these little stems or stalks that can
grow that's what a polyp is go ahead and say it with me a pedunculated so now
you can tell your friends and family that a polyp is a pedunculated tissue in
your colon certain polyps have a higher risk of colon cancer hands down the best
type of food to help prevent the growth of polyps would be sauerkraut or pickled
vegetables why because they contain lactic acid bacteria and lactobacillus
is one type of lactic acid bacteria it's a specific bacteria that is l plus okay
so sauerkraut has this version and these properties it inhibits pathogens it's an
antioxidant it's an anti-inflammatory because when you have inflammation your
colon that by itself can stimulate tumor growth also this bacteria helps to tight
junctions in your colon so it can prevent leaky gut also this friendly
bacteria binds to carcinogens which are things that cause cancer it will also
decrease mutations and decrease pre cancer growth the benefits of sauerkraut
or pickled vegetables is that you not only have the probiotic you have the
prebiotic the fiber which then feeds the microbe it makes short chain fatty acids
one being butyrate which then can reduce the stimulation of tumors polyps and
decrease inflammation now you don't need a tremendous amount
but through the week I would definitely include either sauerkraut or pickled
vegetables and your diet thanks for watching

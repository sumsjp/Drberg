hi guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about nose trauma or
injury sometimes people actually get hit in the nose like they're playing
basketball and they get hit in the nose or they get punched in the nose or they
might have a surgery from some type of nasal defect from their septum or
surgery from the sinus or some other trauma to the nose this technique I'm
going to show you is quite amazing because it actually helps relieve any
type of trauma that occurs after nose injury sometimes when you have the
trauma somehow in the face either the person now has a stuffy nose or they
have a heaviness in the head or they're tired in the head and this technique
kind of gets rid of that and it helps increase energy and just more
circulation because when you injure yourself you lose communication in that
area okay so check it out okay so the question is have you ever injured your
nose yes I used to cheer in high school and we were doing a stunt and
unfortunately I fell down and I'll and it's like straight on my face
ouch now what about do you ever have fatigue in your head yes okay so what
we're going to do is I'm going to show you how to fix this injury because the
trauma goes right to the nose the the force travels to the next bone over so
the force is stuck in the little joints next to the nose and then on the top
right here so we're going to do is we're going to press into the nose this way
but not on the nose so we're gonna take this bone right here and press into it
right there and this should be a little bit tender
is that tender mm-hm yeah so we're pressing into it right underneath the
eye don't poke the eye out I'm not giving you the middle finger so we're
just kind of pressing right into it this way
and my pressure is like tractioning of the bone you could probably even do this
to yourself press into the area right here okay and
then we'll do the other side so I'm gonna come into the nose this way
pressing and holding for about an hour no I'm just kidding
what this is doing releasing the old tension around the nose
I mean trauma gets stuck in the tissues it's like a force that gets stuck as a
standing wave and you can do this to any injury but the nose is a common one for
people that had surgery to the nose broken nose I got punched in the nose
okay now there's a suture in the top part so we want to come down this way
right into the nose
okay good so tell me um if your head feels any different feels like maybe a
little looser hmm like not as tense feels like I just got a face massage
yeah yeah it's interesting because it'll actually give you more space it opens up
the the stuck flows and your face will just feel lighter and you'll have it's
really good for people that have chronic sinus stuff that's related to an injury
you wouldn't think that's connected but sometimes it is so any type of trauma
just helps even the clarity of vision especially because a trauma you lose
communication so to that degree you lose function of that tissue to some degree
so that's pretty much how you do the procedure and thank you for being a

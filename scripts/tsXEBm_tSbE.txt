so this is going to be a very quick video someone wanted to know
how do i increase my production of ketones i want to get deeper into ketosis so what i'm going to do
is i'm just going to create this short video to talk about the six ways to trigger ketones okay
number one fasting most people know this the more you fast the longer you fast the more
ketones you're going to make number two a low carb diet the lower the carbohydrate in your
diet the more ketones you're going to make this is directly related to the hormone insulin the
lower the insulin level the more ketones your body is going to make number three prolonged intense
exercise okay that's going to also trigger ketones you're going to burn up your stored sugar and then
you're going to start burning ketones number four alcoholism the more alcohol you drink
the more damage to the liver the more ketones you're going to produce number five uncontrolled
type 1 diabetes the big difference between type 1 and type 2 is type 1 is a situation where you're
not making enough insulin so remember we talked about low insulin high ketones if your body is not
making insulin you're then making more ketones the problem with this one is that it's a disease state
and now without insulin your blood sugars start going higher and higher and higher if you're not
taking insulin so this is why i said uncontrolled type 1 diabetes if someone has a damaged pancreas
and they're not making insulin and they're not taking insulin they're going to get a situation
where their body is going to make way too many ketones and that is going to lead to something
called ketoacidosis a very dangerous state all right number six mct oil when you consume mct oil
you actually generate more ketones and of course number four number five is not how you want to
get your ketones focus on number one two and number six and regarding number three prolong
intense exercise i would recommend doing a shorter version of intense exercise as in high intensity
interval training and anytime you're doing exercise prolonged i would keep your intensity
on the low side all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by

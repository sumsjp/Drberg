i want to talk about why harmless
bacteria
can turn bad so there's all sorts of
different relationships
that we have with bacteria you have good
bacteria that
exchange with us we provide a home for
them to live in
they give us vitamins immune protection
then you have another relationship with
bacteria which is commensal
in which one organism benefits with
another
without hurting them or necessarily
helping them so
in this relationship they're just living
there they're just neutral
they're not causing us any harm and then
sometimes they will flip
in the relationship with us and turn
pathogenic
which they can cause disease and there's
a handful these bacteria that can do
this a certain types of strep bacteria
e coli candida that basically is
harmless
and then something happens and they flip
and they start
creating harm in fact some of these
bacteria
in a 30-day cycle can go through 500
generations
and morph into something very harmful
to our bodies they can go from harmless
to actually
killing us now the key factor that
changes this relationship
is the environment that they live in
it's the environmental
pressures so when this environment
changes in ph
oxygen levels oxidative stress
temperature chemicals and this can all
occur
with what you put in your body what you
expose your body to
in a mainly talking diet based on what
you feed your body the environment can
change from
one spectrum to the other people that
live on
junk food end up having a lot more
pathogens
people that eat healthier have less
pathogens
and of course this also relates to
plants if a plant is given enough
nutrients they have less pests they have
less pathogens
they have less disease and so the
nutrients
build up our own defenses so in other
words the good bacteria can actually
defend us
and protect us against the pathogens so
um one big factor that changes the
environment really fast
is antibiotics because for some reason
bacteria don't like to be killed so when
you try to
kill them they resist being killed
because they want to survive
and so they start to become super bugs
resistant to that antibiotic
and they flip their relationship and
they start to harm us
an example that would be this infection
called mrsa
and you usually see this in hospitals
and mrs a very highly resistant strand
of bacteria
that is very difficult to kill with
anything
including antibiotics another example
would be c
diff and there's another adaptation that
occurs too with bacteria when they're
stressed
because of environmental pressures is
they start developing
these little igloos to live in that's
called biofilms
so they start to develop colonies and
protect themselves against
anything that can try to kill them and
now we have a situation because these
biofilms
are very very difficult to get rid of
and they're linked to a lot of disease
and pathologies now the other thing i
want to point out
is this when our bodies are under stress
our immune system becomes weakened in
other words
all the white blood cells become
suppressed
so stress increases cortisol
that shuts down our immune system
and this makes us very susceptible to
developing
additional infections and susceptible to
pathologies
and pathogens so out of all the things
that can harm us from an infection
i would say stress hands down is the
single
biggest factor now the next thing i want
to bring up is an interesting
strategy that bacteria do when they're
under stress
it's called horizontal gene transfer
so when these bacteria are under stress
they will literally grab the dna
from other dead bacteria pull them into
themselves
and start to manipulate that dna to
become
more of a pathogen it's kind of like dna
sex where you're mixing this
other dna from a bacteria or
a virus i mean that's just wild
so there are some things you can do
about this to prevent these pathogens
from existing
number one make sure that the
environment that your microbes live in
is
very very friendly make sure you only
take an antibiotic if you absolutely
positively need it
and also if you are taking an antibiotic
also at the same time
take a probiotic the other thing is do
whatever you can
to minimize your stress level watch my
videos on that
make sure your diet is very very good
because especially if you're on a high
carb diet you're eating a lot of sugar
that's going to feed the unfriendly
yeast and candida
and make them grow because they live on
glucose
but the other thing that you can do
that's very very important start doing
intermittent fasting
fasting strengthens your immune system
fasting strengthens the diversity of
your good bacteria
and so fasting is a necessity not only
as a preventative thing
but also if you actually have pathogens
in your body
hey before you go if you're benefiting
from

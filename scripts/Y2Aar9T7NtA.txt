hey guys I wanted to do a video for those people who can't do Keto and
intermittent fasting a hundred percent okay they can sort of do it but they're
having a hard time staying consistent okay well here's the thing if something
is better than nothing okay so do what you can work towards the ideal scene
okay but there's relative importance --is you have things that are moderately
bad and you have things that are really really bad to avoid and I want to just
kind of make the distinction between the two in this list
these are the things you really want to stay away from okay if you cheat or go
off the program and that would be soda because it's just pure sugar and juice
pure sugar especially if the juice in the soda is made with high fructose corn
syrup so that's really really really bad to cheat with or to go off the program
with candy which is usually made from high-fructose corn syrup or or our
dextrose they never use you know actual cane sugar anymore but still candy wood
is concentrated sugar a doughnut which is completely refined carbohydrate and
fat and sugar on top of that you want to avoid that diet soda so not good
long-term so if you're a chronic diet soda drinker it could create a lot of
health problems down the road not right away but down the road so I would
recommend to avoid this one canned fruit with syrup I've heard is corn syrup
really bad okay so avoid that like the plague and
then also the combination of meat with sugar okay so if you were to go to a
Chinese restaurant or a fast food restaurant and they serve this sweet
sauce around the meat really bad barbecue sauce
really bad the combination is really bad because it it increases something that
makes your blood really really sticky and it's real thick and it can create
problems with your heart okay and even plaquing meatloaf is the combination of
their bread with meat if you have a hamburger with ketchup which is high
fructose corn syrup with the bun really bad then when you add starch to
that on top of that with this meal so you're
doing some greasy fries okay so that's not good this combination is not going
to be good for your insulin levels at all so then you have the combination of
fat and sugar like an ice cream traditional ice cream you have all this
high fat with a ton of sugar not a good combination so any combination with
protein or sugar or fat and sugar is not good all right now the occasional list
right here let's say you do a sweet potato a yam just potato rice okay so
have it occasionally it's definitely better than these things right here okay
alcohol make sure if you're doing alcohol occasionally small amounts
you're doing something more dry and not so sweet fruit well it's definitely
better than these if you have some occasional fruit or beans or unsweetened
yogurt these are things that I would kind of if you're going to cheat that do
these right here and not these right here let's say you go off track and you
want to repair the damage there's a couple things I'm gonna recommend
electrolyte powder this puts the potassium back in you'll feel better
quick if you do it you can take a drink of it and you'll feel a lot better
and then the wheatgrass juice powder this is like putting the nutrients back
in simply because a lot of these foods deplete vitamins and minerals so we want
to put them back in and have you get right back on track now if there's a
holiday a birthday party a social event go off the program get right back on the
program the way that I would recommend looking at this is if you were to just
take a sheet of paper and divide it down the center and just look at it from the
standpoint of in a given day how many things do you do to create your health
okay are you exercising are you sleeping good are you doing
things to lower your stress are you eating healthy and then all the things
are you doing to counter create your health okay you know whatever that is
and you want to make sure you keep creating your health every single day
that's how you get healthy thanks for watching

hey guys it's me again I want to share some of the biggest mistakes and most
embarrassing things and kind of crazy things that I have done to try to get
healthy all right I'm going to I'm going to tell you tell you what I've done I
was very very very very sick when I was 28 a couple years ago I'm just kidding
I'm 50 right now but I was very sick and I hit bottom and I was searching for
everything my house was a warehouse of vitamins I would take massive I would
take close to a hundred vitamins a day I mean it's crazy I had a warehouse and every
every place we go we drive another time I went hey honey let's let's go over
there there's a there's a health house over there maybe they can help me and we
go in there and get all these vitamins and try this and I kept going to the
vitamin store just trying to get help and I didn't know what to do so here's some of
the things that I've done number one twelve ounces of daikon radish juice
okay now radishes have incredible properties and I'm not even saying this
is necessarily a bad thing it was just the amount of juice that was consuming
because I those daikon radishes are very spicy and they're hot and they're very
long and they're white and I juiced this huge container and and what I did is I
just plugged my nose and drank the whole thing really fast well that was a big
mistake because it burned a hole right through my body all the way down and it
opened the gates of hell in my digestive system and that was like I did it
because it's supposed to clean you out it definitely will clean you out that is
very very painful okay so that's that's the first thing I've done number two
ear candles now some people might really like these and they probably a
lot of benefit honestly I don't think they do what they say you're going to do
you're basically laying down and you're sticking this candle this hollow candle
in your ear to pull out the wax out of your ear and you can see all these
little things come out but I don't think they're really coming out I think it's
the wax on the inside that are building up of course I was really excited about
I have my parents doing it my relatives my wife's parents
I got everyone doing this and I don't think it really ever did anything he's
kind of dangerous could kind of burn some things so that was that's number
two number three is called a colema now what is a coema is a
combination between a colonic and an enema on steroids you basically take
a five gallon bucket of water and you put some clay in there and you take
a tube with an enema tube and you lay on this board on your toilet and you
basically flush you put five gallons of water in your body you flush out all
this waste and you do that morning and night for seven days okay and you're
taking all these vitamins to flush you out and I think it was a roto-rooter on
steroids I made it cleaned me out but that was really really really really a
massive detox that kind of depleted me of all my electrolytes if I would have
done it again knowing better I probably would have put some electrolytes because
you're putting you're flushing a lot of things out of your body and that could
be dangerous as far as your heart because you're not understanding how to
do it correctly of course with me I didn't even read the directions I just
oh I know how to do this and I did it incorrectly so that was called a colema
so number four I did the olive oil gallbladder cleanse now what is olive
olive oil gallbladder cleanse this is where you take 12 ounces of olive oil 2
ounces of epsom salts and you mix it together and you take a handful of
concentrated beet tablets down that and you drink
12 ounces of olive oil right and then you lay on your right side all night
long and it's supposed to pull out all these stones and then of course when you
look in the toilet these these round green things that is not stones those
are floaters that is all your bile and basically all I did is depleted all
my bile reserve and I just crave things like crazy the next few days so
and it almost killed me because the mistake I made
was you don't use olive oil like water like you're flushing these pills down
because the oil combined with the epson salts like a chemical that combined with
the beats to make it solid right in my esophagus right down here and it
actually got stuck in there and I couldn't breathe I just barely survived
that and that was a nightmare so that was the olive oil gallbladder cleanse
number five heavy-duty probiotic now probiotic is a friendly
bacterium and there's different gradients or amounts of bacteria I use
the one that was so strong so powerful in that I mean it detoxed that heck out of
me and the problem with it is that I ended up the next day with Lyme disease
don't ask me how I was I didn't have a tick I just actually reactivated
something in my body had rashes and everything I went get gotten tested
because I started having inflammation I'm like what is going on so it dumped
everything and anything out of my body and what happened was it kept getting
worse so I actually did the natural remedies that you're supposed to do but
it didn't quite work so I had to basically I had to go get a pro
antibiotic unfortunately it was called bactrim I think bactrim and that was
like I felt like my body was a washing board because it was it just
killed everything in my body so I had to heal from that just triggered from this
I mean it was like a chain reaction that just really wiped me out for several
weeks so eventually I got my immune system strong where I'm I don't have a
problem anymore but that was that's number five number six
called the rusty nail experiment or whatever a situation so I have a
backyard and I have a little compost pile and one summer I'm working on there
and I stepped on a nail okay I stepped in a nail so I go inside the house and I
tell my wife and she says well you better get a tetanus shot and I'm like
I'm like it tetanus shot I mean first of all it's not
really rusty secondly I don't really believe in those those things so it's
not going to be a problem okay I cleaned it up it didn't really go that deep
whatever so anyway the next day I go to the office I sit down in front of my
first client who's a new client and the first thing out of her mouth which she
tells me a story that she basically stepped in a rusty nail and she didn't
do anything about it and she had lockjaw so bad that she went to the emergency
room and she almost died and she's telling me this whole experience I'm
like we almost died she was yeah once you get because you there's a time frame
and once it goes past that you could die and I'm like I'm sitting there with her
that I mean what's like it's like hello you know someone's trying to tell me
something here so basically right when that new client was done I said cancel
all my appointments and I ran to an urgent care and I said okay give me give
me the shot I'll take the shot right it's like you know you don't have to
warn me that much right so they she gives me the shot for tetanus I go home
and I get a call that night and she says oh we gave you the wrong shot I'm like
what do you mean you gave me the wrong shot so I Drive all the way back and get
the right shot but it had me freaking out because the last thing I want to get
is tetanus but that was just kind of a mistake of not taking care of myself and
there is a point where you know you need to do some medical care number seven the
Master Cleanse now this is basically you're basically living on lemon water
and maple syrup for about ten days okay and burn first of all it's like drinking
sugar water there's no nutrients in it at all lemons
are not enough to giving nutrients so basically you're starving yourself for
ten days so it's like a fast and I was craving pizza so bad towards the end I
was dreaming about pizza I I felt high blood sugar issues
irritable it was a nightmare so the problem is doing this Master Cleanse ne
cleanse you detox and then you go right back to your pizza or old ways because
you can't you can't avoid it because you're craving so much so I never really
fixed the real problem okay so that was the Master Cleanse and I don't recommend
doing it because it's like a starvation thing number eight I did a kidney herbal
detox and these these herbs were from China and I didn't really study about
the side-effects from these herbs but I took you know my whole concept is unlike
the human guinea pig if it and I'll go ahead and if a little bit as good I'll
do a lot and that was a big mistake because I drank half the bottle and what
happened I started getting a sore throat lung
infection I was in bed for a week with a fever it turned on everything so I had
all sorts of things just kind of mobilized from my body and what happens
the problem with some of these detox is they they dump your liver in your kidney
and it recirculates your blood to the whole body so it's like taking this
these toxicity things and then pushing them in other organs that's why I don't
I don't like like powerful cleanses like that especially if you don't know what
you're doing and if you're going too fast okay so these are just things that
I've found that obviously didn't work for me I'm sure you have similar
experiences or maybe not but I just wanted to kind of point these out and
anytime you do something kind of new you want to either be supervised research it
and or do it on a smaller gradient so you don't go too far alright thanks for
watching I'll see you the next video

i wanted to cover what food is most exposed to pesticides and what is the least exposed or the
cleanest foods avocado very clean it is one of the foods that has the lowest exposure to pesticides
so if you're buying avocados and you see organic which is crazy expensive versus commercial
you might want to just get commercial because there's already low pesticides now as far as the
highest raisins which if you're on keto you don't have to worry about that because you're not going
to be consuming raisins but look at strawberries a lot of people on keto do strawberries i would
definitely go organic with that spinach a lot of people on keto do that a lot of pesticides kale
right of course nectarines apples grapes peaches cherries pears you're not going to
do that if you're on keto but tomato and celery and of course you're not going to worry about
potato so these are definitely ones that i would make sure that they're organic
okay look at this cabbage onion frozen peas asparagus eggplant cauliflower and broccoli
on the low side and so if you're really on a budget and you really can't do everything organic
you know maybe these are your best options hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled
how to bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why

so today I'm going to talk about vitamin k2 and some of the functions that go way
beyond just dealing with bone formation we talked about vitamin k2 most people
associate that with making your bones more solid and also removing the soft
tissue calcium from the joints or the arteries and then driving that into the
bone and vitamin k2 works with item and D but vitamin k2 does a lot more as far
as the function of bone goes we might think it's just a structural scaffolding
to hold everything together but bone not only provides a structural function but
it's vital in making immune cells a lot of your immune cells originate from the
bone marrow but there's another interesting function your bone acts as
an endocrine gland it makes a hormone called osteocalcin has to do with a
hormone that can affect your blood sugars and it just so happens that
vitamin k2 triggers this hormone so vitamin k2 has the capacity of improving
insulin resistance and when I say improving insulin resistance I'm not
talking about worsening insulin resistance talking about making it
better because vitamin k2 can increase insulin sensitivity and there's so many
people on this planet right now that have a problem with instant resistance
without being aware of it so vitamin k2 can help stabilize your blood sugars and
increase the output the production of insulin from your pancreas but it does
other things as well it has a capacity to suppress inflammation vitamin k2 is
an anti-inflammatory vitamin we know vitamin D is anti-inflammatory by
vitamin k2 can also help as well now number four vitamin k2 can decrease fat
accumulation why because it helps to balance insulin all right number five
vitamin k2 can also increase the capacity of energy in your mitochondria
when you exercise now I have some personal experience on this one
here when I take vitamin k2 30 minutes before I go on a bike ride I have much
better endurance especially going up hills now and number six
it can even increase testosterone now realize if you're female it's not going
to increase testosterone beyond your normal levels okay so it's just gonna
help balance testosterone now let's talk about the foods that are high in vitamin
k2 NATO which is fermented soybeans butter if it's grass-fed yolk as an egg
yolk goose liver pepperoni of course without the nitrates
salami without the nitrates sausage sauerkraut in certain cheese's like
Munster cheese Gouda brie another one being Edom and hard cheese the key is
grass-fed chase now if you look at some of these foods like NATO and sauerkraut
k2 is made by a bacteria it's part of the fermentation process now if you look
at some of these other ones they're either coming from an animal fat or milk
or an egg but the animal originally a grass which has a lot of vitamin k1 and
then converts it to k2 as a fat soluble vitamin and it gets stored in the fat

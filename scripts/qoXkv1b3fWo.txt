now could you potentially be on birth
control without really being aware of it
today we're going to discuss
soy
now what's so bad about soy i mean it's
a healthy product it's in a lot of our
foods um it's good for the heart
it's good to help prevent breast cancer
and in asia they do tons of soy right it
can't be that bad i mean if you just
look at the research i mean you'll see
tons of study on the first five pages of
google endorsing soy as the next miracle
food
well
um i want to share some information from
a very interesting book that i am
reading right now it's called the whole
soy
story by dr kayla daniel she has her phd
in nutritional sciences as well as being
a certified clinical nutritionist so i'm
going to put the link for her book down
below as well as all the research i'm
going to talk about well here's the
thing about soy soy
um
acts very similar to estradiol okay in
our bodies now yes it is a thousand
times weaker
however it has a much higher affinity
for our receptors than our own estrogen
which means it can easily bind to these
estrogen receptors and create
some physiological responses so soy does
create an estrogenic effect on our
bodies so for people to say that the
science is settled don't look at this
it's we already know it's safe you might
want to just take another look at what
i'm going to share with you
now as far as in asia it is true that
they consume maybe more soy however
it's used as a condiment it's not used
as your main food and it's usually
always in the form of a fermented soy
product nato
miso
tofu and they don't actually use the
form of soy that we use in america like
soy protein isolates hydrolyzed soy
proteins
and the highly refined soy oil which is
in oh my gosh it's in hummus it's in
salad dressing it's in a lot of your
foods it's actually even an oatmeal they
put it in sodas i mean it is like all
over our foods now it is true that the
japanese have a lower rate of breast
cancer however they have a higher rate
of other cancers that americans don't
have so
if you really look at the research on
soy there's a lot of mixed
conclusions
mainly based on who's sponsoring the
study so let's just go through this 1994
there was a an article written by the
american dietetic association that
stated that women trying to conceive
should avoid excessive soy and they
recommend having less than 60 grams a
day
now some people are going to say well
those are older studies well actually
there's probably more integrity of some
of these older studies than there is
nowadays because they can make a study
come out any way that they want now if
you look at the physiology and this was
done in animal studies
soy can give an estrogenic effect that
can greatly affect
follicle stimulating hormone as well as
luteinizing hormone these are the two
hormones that are sent from the
pituitary down to your gonads and they
regulate estrogen progesterone and
testosterone so if you're going to
suppress
follicular stimulating hormone and
luteinizing hormone you're going to have
a less
release of the egg from the ovary and
that's going to make you more infertile
it's also going to affect the menstrual
cycle you may find your menstrual cycle
going longer you may find your menstrual
cycle actually not even occurring in
another study which i'll put down below
in the thumbnail sketch the study said
that there is a less probability of
giving birth in a male study there was
shown to be lower sperm count
decreased erections
decreased libido
hot flashes
increase in breast tissue in male bodies
nipple discharge and lower testosterone
i mean if you think about who consumes
the most soy on a regular basis
it's in the monasteries the monks in the
monasteries consume a tremendous amount
of soy and i think the reason they do it
is because it helps curb libido now the
other thing that's interesting and it's
hard to find
data on this topic is that 70 of all the
soy grown
is used in animal feeds so who knows
what that's doing to our animals i know
it's in dog food it's in cat food it's
actually even in fish food and the
reason i'm talking about that is because
we have animals now on my farm
and it's very difficult to find feed
that is soy free
now the most problematic
thing that i see with soy is in the soy
based infant formulas so you're going to
give soy to an infant the amount of soy
that you're going to expose this infant
to is between six to nine milligrams per
kilogram of weight per day so there's
been links to higher body weight i mean
estrogen is an anabolic hormone it makes
things get bigger and in some of these
infant formulas there's an equivalent
estrogen if you compare their body
weight to an adult of taking roughly
three to five birth control pills a day
not to mention a lot of these infants
have allergies to soy and digestive
issues as far as the quality of protein
it's not the best quality
this is why it's so important to
encourage a mother to breastfeed now soy
in general is also linked to
hypothyroidism
endocrine problems digestive issues
and the list goes on and on so i really
suggest you should start to read labels
okay start reading labels um
like even like when you get hummus right
when the first ingredient is soy oil try
to find a dressing with other oils than
soy oil or corn oil unfortunately most
the soy out there is gmo and i think
globally we're in this huge experiment
of
soy many of these
problematic ingredients
show up years later so i think it's
really important to see the other side
of soy look at the pros and the cons and
then decide for yourself now if you have
not seen my video on estrogen dominance
i'm going to put it up right here check
it out

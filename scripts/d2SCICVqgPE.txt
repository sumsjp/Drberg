all right so today I want to evaluate the so-called friendly keto ice creams
you're gonna be exposed to a lot of different products and sometimes you
don't know if they're actually that healthy or not but to be defined as keto
you want to be low-carb but even that is a very loose term and there's no exact
legal definition of a low-carb so my whole thing is to promote healthy keto
the healthy version of the ketogenic diet and that includes nutrient-dense
foods that have higher quality ingredients so let's just kind of go
through each brand and let's talk about some of the ingredients I'm not gonna
put all the ingredients there I did not see a problem with a lot of the
ingredients but there's several ingredients that I am concerned about
now the first thing I learned just mentioned is sugar alcohols so most of
these brands use a sugar alcohol called erythritol now what's good about
that is it's zero on the glycemic index what's bad about that is that unless
it's non-gmo it could be made from GMO ingredients so on some of these products
I did not see the non GMO in fact all of them I did not see if it's non-gmo or
not so if it's GMO that could be a problem especially if it's made from
corn because it could have traces of glyphosate that herbicide so that's one
thing the other thing you need to know about is when you start consuming ice
cream it's very easy to consume a lot of it and one serving size will give you 7
grams of erythritol the keto brand will give you 8 grams and the rebel will
give you 9 grams of sugar alcohol so don't be surprised if you have digestive
issues bloating diarrhea especially if you actually have too much now as far as
the halo brand I could not find this data all I did find was halo is that it
had 10 grams of net carbs pretty high also it contained wheat flour enriched
and wheat flour which that is a bad ingredient and sugar
now enlighten also had sugar in it which I I'm very much against especially if
you're adding protein which is the milk protein with the sugar
that can create a sticky protein is called advanced glycated protein so it
makes things all sticky and there's a lot of problems with that because what
they have to do when they make this ice cream is put everything in a vat and
cook it so your pasteurizing it to keep the bacterial counts low and then if you
have sugar with some of the proteins which I'm going to talk about that's
when you have the problem now if we compare this to traditional regular ice
cream at the store I mean there's a lot more sugar in those brands so this is
gonna be less but you don't really want any added sugar to your ice cream or any
ketose snack for that matter now the other thing I didn't like about keto is
the tapioca fiber I don't like anything tapioca it's just not a good keto
friendly ingredient that I would recommend so now let's go through some
of the other ingredients some of these products had skim milk some had cream
most of them had cream and some had whole milk the problem with these is
that you don't know if they're organic in fact if they're not labeling it as
organic you know it's not organic it's commercial milk products and with
commercial milk products you have the cow consuming corn in soil which is
gonna be GMO I would challenge these companies to go organic with at least
the dairy part right through here the other thing I just mentioned is the
sugar you don't want to have any sugar in the product or wheat or tapioca the
egg yolk that they used was not organic it should be so you want to do organic
egg yolks because you really don't know the quality of the chicken that laid the
egg so I mentioned some of the points right here but the biggest problem with
every single one of these brands is this ingredient right here MPC milk
protein concentrates another name for that would be milk protein isolates
exact same product now what MPC is it's a group of proteins
that come from milk they're dehydrated and dried out it has a combination of
casein whey protein other proteins and I want to put a couple links down below to
show the relationship between these proteins and inflammation in your liver
now I personally have first-hand knowledge of this because anytime I
consume anything with this one ingredient I can feel my liver becoming
inflamed there's pain around the liver apparently I'm very very sensitive to
that product now this is what people don't realize is that almost all milk
protein concentrates are imported from China and Mexico and on top of that this
product is not regulated so anytime we have something imported and we don't
really know where it's coming from or what was done to it because we know it's
not organic so there's just a lot of unknowns and if you're one of these
brands watching this video right now I would highly suggest you get rid of this
ingredient from your product not to mention go organic with the with
the dairy products and the egg products and make sure you have no added sugar or
tapioca and of course take the flour out of the product that is not keto friendly
anyway thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video

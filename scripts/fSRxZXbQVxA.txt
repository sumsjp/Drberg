you know i've done a video on the
negatives of distilled water today i'm
going to talk about the positive things
about distilled water there's a lot of
people
that are getting amazing results from
using distilled water so i want to share
a little bit more on what it is and how
you can use it and what it could be good
for distilled water is basically pure
h2o without any of the impurities
without any viruses bacteria because
those get killed in the heating process
also all the minerals are taken out all
the heavy metals are taken out
all the pharmaceutical drugs
medications
that are estrogenic
are removed and also the toxic chemical
gases are removed as well they're called
volatile organic compounds so you get
rid of that and you just have pure water
and it's called hungry water because
it's like a very potent solvent which
i'm going to explain so you're basically
boiling the water turning it to steam
and then funneling it into some
container
like rain and snow are like nature's
distilled water where it becomes
evaporated goes into the clouds and it
comes down
of course nowadays because of all the
pollution in the air and the
like plastics
in the air
you don't want to be drinking rain water
or snow but long ago it probably was
something really good to
drink so distilled water has a ph of
seven it's completely neutral and it has
some really interesting benefits and of
course the
the version of distilled water i'm going
to recommend is not going to be the one
that you would buy at the grocery store
in a plastic
jug that's been sitting there for a long
time leaching out all the plastics
into this distilled water i'm going to
recommend
probably making your own getting a unit
that has stainless steel that then
filters it to a glass container that
would be the ideal situation so there's
some really interesting benefits number
one it can help remove certain toxins
like heavy metals
like mercury
cadmium
lead and nowadays we are swimming in a
sea
of chemicals hitting us from every
different angle and it's hard to know
the influence of these chemicals on our
bodies so drinking this to water gives
you a chance to
see what you would really feel like
without these heavy metals and other
toxins that are
in your body all right number two it can
help remove
deposits of certain minerals that
uh you don't want in your joints okay
let's say you have arthritis or
stiffness
well distilled water can help break down
some of that
that deposit
and remove it from the body so a lot of
people feel just less stiff they feel
more flexible when they drink distilled
water
also removing calcium from your arteries
there are several things you can do to
remove calcium from the arteries like
vitamin k2
a good chelator like edta
but also you can use distilled water as
a chelator to pull out this excess
calcium from your arteries now as we age
calcium builds up also in other tissues
like our eyes
you know i guess cataracts
so that's another benefit okay number
three
if you're prone to kidney stones or even
gall stones
there is a buildup of calcium and so
distilled water would be a really
important thing
to take if you want to reduce your risk
of getting stones in the body now the
question that you're probably going to
have is well i don't i've heard rumors
that if you drink distilled water it's
going to deplete me of all my minerals
and it's going to throw off my
electrolytes and probably cause my red
blood cells to explode and i might die
right well that's not going to happen
because what all you need to do is
put the minerals that you want or you
need back into your body just start
taking electrolytes with the distilled
water so that way you can have
more of certain minerals and not too
much of other minerals we don't want a
lot of extra calcium in our joints in
our eyes and in our arteries so all
these minerals or metals that have a
hard time getting out of the body
can be excreted a bit more with
distilled water now one thing you might
find when you start drinking this water
is it can increase diuresis so you're
going to urinate a bit more but just
drink more water so you can start
flushing out things and start cleaning
out your body so just make sure you put
the minerals back into your body
as well as eating foods that are high in
minerals now another point i want to
bring up is should you be drinking
distilled water when you're fasting and
i think it's actually a really really
good idea because even though it will
deplete your electrolytes you can easily
put those back in but think about what's
happening when you're fasting you are
going through autophagy you are
cleaning up old dead cells
you're cleansing and you're detoxifying
and your body is generating a lot of
antioxidants when you're fasting so a
lot of good things are happening and if
you add the distilled water to this you
can at the same time assist in removing
a lot of these
toxins that are coming out from the body
but again just make sure you put those
minerals back in
now there's a lot of people that
actually
drink their tap water okay there's city
water and others will get a filter and
that's all great but what you have to
realize is that
yes it's true that there might be low
bacterial counts in the tap water the
city water that you drink
but that's because they're adding a lot
of additional chemicals to sterilize or
kill these microbes
so even though it might be free of
microbes it might be very high in these
chemicals that are going to affect you
and these chemicals are estrogenic they
have effects on your skin
your brain
in fact the entire body i mean there's
some pretty disgusting things in tap
water that they found like toilet paper
particles tampon particles i mean it's
pretty disgusting so at the very least
get a filter
and you may want to
consider getting a good steam distiller
now on that note if you haven't seen my
video
on
how much water to drink
i put that up right here check it out

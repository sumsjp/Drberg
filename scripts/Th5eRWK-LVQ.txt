let's talk about the effects of zinc on your respiratory system zinc is so
connected to the immune system especially your lungs that I thought I'd
just do one video dedicated to that one topic if you're deficient in zinc the
duration of lung infection is increased next one if you're deficient in zinc
you'll have diminished t-cell function there are three main types of t-cells
and this stands for thymus these are immune cells you have the killer T cells
which specialized in killing viruses you have the helper T cells which are the
coordinating unit very very important in all aspects of your immune system
they recruit the backup army they increase the killing power of phagocytes
they are a real essential and key coordinator for the entire immune system
and they're greatly affected by the level of zinc in the body and then you
have another T cell called a regulatory t-cell and what this cell does is it
suppresses the overreaction of the immune system it also prevents
autoimmune diseases and if this cell is weak you'll have a tendency to have
asthma allergies and even excessive inflammation that seems to linger and it
goes into a chronic phase your T cells really really need zinc next point is
that if your zinc deficient you'll have a lot more cytokines cytokines have many
different functions one being messengers another one is pro-inflammatory so it
can cause inflammation that's all part of the immune process but sometimes it
gets out of hand so if you're deficient in zinc you can potentially even go into
a cytokine storm where you have this serious inflammatory condition of the
lung and that can lead to scar tissue was ink deficiency could be a
contributing factor to this right here by the way zinc is a great
anti-inflammatory in general and if you're deficient in zinc your risk for
getting lung infections do go up when you have conditions like COPD chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease your nearly always deficient in zinc your
risk goes up for ARDS a distance for acute respiratory distress syndrome also
you're more at risk for upper respiratory tract infections as well as
lower respiratory tract infections now this next one is very interesting low
levels of zinc can make the lungs more susceptible to ventilator induced injury
now when you get an event to later which is a breathing machine your risk of
mortality goes up the chances of you surviving are less what this does is it
puts a lot of pressure into the lungs and oxygen and if the lungs are already
weakened this could create some additional damage which you don't want
oh zinc can actually help protect the lungs against this damage to a certain
degree and that study I will put down below and it's called zinc deficiency
primes the lung for a ventilator induced injury fascinating if you have a
lung infection if you're sick your body is going to be using so much zinc
chances are you're going to be deficient just the fact that you have an infection
causes a depletion of zinc and then you lose more ability to fight the infection
all right so the next question is what foods do you eat to get zinc and what
are the things that can prevent you from absorbing zinc for that you need to

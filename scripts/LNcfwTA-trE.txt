hi guys in this video we're gonna talk about what is creatine okay a lot of people I've
heard about this some people are taking it as a supplement but it's a combination of three
amino acids arginine lysine and methionine and in your muscles it combines with a phosphate to
help you recycle ATP or the energy currency in the muscles so it helps you recover the energy so it's
it's good for helping you tolerate heavy weight training so you don't get as fatigued it helps
the recovery of the muscle it helps the strength of the muscle it helps the size of the muscle but
you know there's a lot of different types some people are allergic to it so you might want to
you know take a little first to make sure you're not allergic to it but there's two versions that
I think are better than others creatine ethyl ester and micronized creatine so if you were
going to try that I would try either one of these I don't have a specific brand follow the dosage
but again the reason I want to bring this up is because people keep asking me over and over
and over what is it can I take it to increase my muscle mass I think it can help you so if
you're trying to increase muscle mass and you want a little bit of a booster and you're doing
weights you might want to give this a try alright thanks for watching hey you probably already

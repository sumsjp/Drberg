so in this video i want to touch on vitamin d testing
challenges okay the big the big problem with vitamin d is that there's no agreed
upon value of what you should have in your
blood i mean they have an idea or estimation and we can range
all the way from this value right here to this value right here depending on
what units you use could range from this value to this
value i guess you can take an average of these numbers depending on
what units you're measuring vitamin d from
also the institute of medicine will tell you that you need between 600 to 800 IUS
of vitamin d every day yet the endocrinology society will say
you need a thousand to 200 IUS every day
so again there's this there's not a lot of agreement on how much you need
or how much should be in your blood a couple things i want to talk about that
are very very important though there's two forms of vitamin d one is an
inactive form 25 hydroxy vitamin d so it's like the precursor to the active
form which is 125 dihydroxy vitamin d
so this is the active form this is the inactive form
the way this works and by the way most of the vitamin d in your blood is
the pre-inactive version and many times what they're testing is
they're testing 25 hydroxy vitamin d they're testing the
precursor or the inactive vitamin d okay put that to the side we'll come
back to it so what happens is you have the
pre-vitamin d that goes through the body and goes
through the liver and from the liver it then goes to the
kidney the kidney is the primary site for
conversion of the inactive to the active version of
vitamin d what if there is damage to the kidney
you're going to lose your conversion capacity and how many
people have damage to the kidney well what damage is a kidney
diabetes is a is a big thing but also insulin resistance
what percentage of the population has insulin resistance i would say between
65 to 75 of the entire population that is going to alter the ability for
the kidney to convert the inactive to the active
when you get your test back from the lab that says your 5-hydroxy vitamin d is
within normal levels well what about the active form
are you getting a 100 conversion by the kidney
is there any problem with the kidney that's one variable
it's very common to have people with a defect
in the vitamin d receptors called polymorphism
and even though you may have normal vitamin d in your blood it's not
being activated because at the receptor level it's not working
also if there's not enough bile in the body
you won't get the conversion and if there's liver damage
you won't be able to produce the bile to make the conversion
if there's no gallbladder there you could be bile deficient so you're not
going to have enough bile to make the conversion
we already mentioned about insulin resistance if there's
inflammation in the body that can lower your ability to convert vitamin d
if there's malabsorption gut problems let's say you had a series of
antibiotics as a child and that created scarring of your in your
colon that can create a decreased capacity for conversion if
you had a gastric bypass that could also alter your ability to
convert vitamin d so as you can see there are many different variables
so you have to look at the big picture what i tell people is to err on the side
of taking more vitamin d than less and make sure
you have enough bile so you can actually get the absorption
all right i hope i didn't add more confusion but i wanted to clear
up some of these variables and the point of this video was just to
mention that just because this right here is normal
doesn't necessarily mean it's being fully converted
to the active form hey we're back with another amazing
recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there's no
suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you
should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy
to be keto but is it simple it's super simple we
hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying
eating it

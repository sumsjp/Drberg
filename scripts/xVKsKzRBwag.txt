let's talk about the non-plant non-vegetable sources of vitamin c
and there definitely are some typically when people think vitamin c they think
citrus or bell peppers sauerkraut leafy greens
spinach parsley strawberries or other berries
cabbage but there are other food sources of vitamin c as well
certain organ meats like liver whale skin
also has vitamin c so the next time you get a craving for whale skin now you
know it's low dose vitamin c oysters have a
good amount of vitamin c brain okay so i know a lot of you out
there consume brain on a regular basis so now you know
you're getting your vitamin c now as far as
meat goes there's some conflicting data certain types of meats
may have vitamin c some may not but if you overcook the meat you destroy
the vitamin c so you'd probably want to have some meat
on the rare side to get the benefits of vitamin c and lastly
probably your favorite seal meat if you have it
slightly sauteed or fried in butter you'll get
some good vitamin c or seal liver so there you have it other sources of
vitamin c thanks for watching

hey this is dr. Berg today we're going to talk about the shoulder joint and how
to make it very flexible one of the challenges with having shoulder pain is
that it holds a lot of its stuck energy and it keeps your neck and traps very
very tight a lot of people have that I'm going to show you some great stretches
to make your shoulders very symmetrical and very very loose and less stressful
but the way I'm going to do it is very counterintuitive and it's not taught in
schools so this is something I just learned from doing it on thousands of
patients so I think you can use these techniques now it does help to have
someone else do this on you you can sort of do it yourself so we'll just have to
adapt if you have someone around the house you can have them do this but I
want you to get the principle of how this works so the first thing we're
going to do is we're just going to check the range of motion on the shoulder and
there's a lot of different motions that we can test the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to check the internal and external rotation so we're
just going to take her arm and we're just going to kind of go down this way
okay we're going to internally rotate this way and if you notice the shoulder
goes forward like here so that's not good so let's check this side here you
see how this one moves nicely so she can go all the way down this way look at
that all the way and you can probably even do this on the floor with your arms
down to compare left or right so we want to check first down this way and this
way so you just have someone take this arm out like this and you just rotate it
and see which one is restricted so we're not looking for weak muscles we're
looking for tight muscles which are basically short muscles all right so now
if the shoulder is not moving this way the way we're going to stretch it is the
opposite way now this is different because if I keep stretching like this
is this going to be like a rubberband the way the muscles work is anytime you
move a muscle go ahead and just like like do this okay when she's moving this
muscle when she goes up this is contracting okay in order for this to
contract and move this one has to relax at the same time so when she triggers
this one on this one automatically turns on so they're on the same circuitry on
switch off switch okay so then when she pulls it out she's
contracting this muscle and this one's turning off so anytime we have a muscle
that is constantly in the state of tightness or contraction it's on so we
can either stimulate the opposite muscle with pressure or we can actually stretch
the opposite muscle okay so now if this muscle is not going down this way we're
going to be stretching the opposite way this way so I'm going to stretch all the
way here and then relaxed stretch for a second relax
so all I'm doing is stretching in the the opposite direction that's all so if
I do this for about ten times stretching it really good she's going to start
being able to stretch down here much better see how that works
okay now the next range of motion we're going to check and I just want to just
first do the range of motion so we're going to check going back this way okay
and going back this way and this one seems to go back nicer this side is
contracted now she lays on her back so
we can actually take the arm right here and then go back this way and right here
and just see how far this one goes back and then this one right here so I mean
we're just talking about subtleties but if you lay in your your back and this
arm only goes down this far we know there's a problem with this shoulder so
if that problem let's have you sit up again face the camera
so if this shoulder doesn't go back okay then wel will stress the
opposite way going inward this way so we'll stretch it stretch it stretch it
stretch it stretch it and it's nice to have someone do this on you and then
it's going to go back further and further and further okay so so in other
words you just put the person in the range of motion and then stretch the
opposite way so the next thing we want to do is we want to take the arm out
here and just kind of raise it up as high as it she can go this way right
here and we're going to compare this way you see that so what's happening on the
right side it doesn't want to go up because this muscle down here is too
tight okay so what we're going to have to do is we're going to stretch the
opposite muscle okay so it's kind of like you have to think backwards so what
is the motion the problem is when we stretch down this way her body is in the
way we can't go further than this we can't chop off the body so what we're
going to do is that she's going to grab her arm on the opposite side
let's grab your wrist there like right here yeah so we're going to grab this
and she's going to pull this down yes and she's going to you can lean this way
here and you're going to stretch this right here and so what she's doing is
just doing this right here we're stretching this one so we're stretching
all these muscles here which basically will allow her arm to go all the way up
okay all right so we'll just do the that's just showing you the opposite now
the other thing we want to do is we want to take her elbow right here and bring
it inward okay good now let's compare it with the other side which one is tighter
right okay so with this one we simply going to do
the opposite way going this way right here now if she's going tight right here
that means all the rotator cuffs back here are tight so we want to stretch the
front part of the muscle I'm not going to tell you the muscles and confuse you
but just all these muscles are tight so she could even go on a door like right
here and then stretch these muscles back okay or I can just take her arm and
stretch back this way relaxed stretch here relaxed stretch here relaxed
stretch here okay so that would be how to go forward now the other one is we're
going to go backwards so we're going to just bring your arm back this way and
let's bring this one right here which one's tighter there the right is tighter
okay so then we're going to stress the opposite let's bring your elbow bring
your hand grab your elbow and then pull it forward one two three so that's we're
going to stretch the opposite okay so we're just going through all the range
of motion now the next thing we want to do since the shoulder is connected to
the back we want to tuck the head forward and slouch right down you feel
any tightness or your upper back okay now go back this way horse back is that
easier yeah okay so what she'll do is she's going to actually do extension
stretches she's going to stretch back this way and if you have a ball or
something you can do this on this is good stretch back back back and that's
going to allow her to go forward you see see how I did that okay now the other
thing that I want to do is I'm going to scoot around with your feet over here
basic yes right here okay so now you got two bones right here called the scapula
bones and they connect to all these muscles here called the rotator cuff
switch rotate this so the first thing we do is going to shrug the shoulders on
the right good now shrug on the left which one's easier
the left one is easier so this one doesn't want to go high so guess what
she's going to do she's going to push it down one two three four you could do it
have someone do it manually to and really stretch that because the scapula
creates a lot of tension and these muscles right through here okay so now
we went upward now we're going to actually just take it and go forward
we're going to push it forward and bring this forward
I guess you what you could do is you can take your arm go forward this way right
here yeah okay and then bring the other one yeah you see how you're you're
you're stretching these called rhomboids you're stretching these yeah right there
so which ones tighter when you go forward all right
the right one is tighter again see what happens is that this this bone is moving
on the ribs right through here we want to see if there's any restriction so if
it's tight going this way what we're going to do is we're going to have her
take this and keep it straight keep your arm straight and relax your shoulder arm
straight so we can stretch it back back back just do the opposite motion okay
okay so then the other thing is that let's bring the shoulder inward yes
right there okay now bring this one in or tighter which one's tighter the right
way okay so with that one we're going to actually go outward we'll stretch out
this way okay see how easy this is we just find the motion that's tight and we
do the opposite and the last one is you're going to shrug this down okay and
then strug this down okay I strike this down which one's tighter of course so we
would just stretch it up okay stretch it up now there is a common denominator to
what I'm finding here every single range of motion on the right side is tighter
than the left if this happens then we know there's something else going on and
that means that this shoulder is being caused by something referred by
somewhere else now she did tell me right before I did
this video that she when you were how old thirteen dove off of a at a pool and
hit her head right and compressed the head and fractured these bones right
here just a plate in her neck and I'm thinking okay that could have caused
this but there was no nerve damage of course a compression injury we want to
pull do traction of course right but there's something else that can cause a
right shoulder pain and it's the gallbladder so I'm going to try
something I'm going to do an experiment here I don't know if it's going to work
don't try this at home now I'm just kidding lay right on your back face up
so the gallbladder is right here and all I'm going to do is just kind of press a
little bit in here and massage the gallbladder a little bit with inner
tolerance right through here now what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of
work on this for a couple of minutes and then we're going to see if this is
connected to the shoulder I would say 90% of people with right shoulder have a
gallbladder problem and again if that's the case all the stretching in the world
is not going to work because this is the culprit now what is the relationship
between this gallbladder on the right shoulder there's a nerve that comes
right through here all the way up into the right shoulder so and that would be
called the phrenic nerve you actually have one on the opposite side too
but if it's on the left side it could be the pancreas now is that tender right
through there so we're just kind of coming in there and kind of working it
out a little bit
okay now what I'll be curious about is let's just see what her shoulder does
now okay bend this right here okay relax our shoulder look at that full range of
motion goes all the way back does it feel looser okay so guess what
okay raise this up okay so here's the shortcut if you see all the restriction
on the right side not just one motion you're going to have to work on the area
on the gallbladder to really free it up that was her problem then the next
question would be what is she eating because a lot of junk food rich junk
food sugars alcohol all the stuff can aggravate the gallbladder and caused
this so is there anything that you've eaten that borderlines on not healthy yes sometimes
okay I like that sometimes so we'll cover that after we turn the video off
but yeah so you just have to clean up the diet if you want to keep this
shoulder better also a lot of nuts will do it too okay so that's just some tips
on shoulder range of motion and go ahead and apply some of these stretches and
it's going to take a lot of stress out of your shoulder

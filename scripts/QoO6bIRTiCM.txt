i'm going to talk about the benefits of eating eggs for your brain very interesting there's quite
a few things in an egg that will help you with your cognitive function and your mood and overall
energy for your brain the first thing is choline eggs are loaded with choline and i'm talking about
the egg yolk now what is choline well choline is a precursor for acetylcholine which is not only
essential for cognitive function like memory focus concentration but for also maintaining
a higher level mood so it can actually bring you up and on top of that choline can help you
act as a bile salt to help you improving the absorption of the fat soluble nutrients which are
necessary for the brain like vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e vitamin k1 and vitamin k2 as well as the
next nutrient which i'm going to talk about which is omega-3 fatty acids so buying pasture-raised
organic eggs are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids specifically the dha and your gray matter
is made out of dha plus omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and they can reduce the risk of
clots as in preventing strokes also egg yolks are loaded with cholesterol which is necessary for
making vitamin d making various hormones and also providing the raw material for all of your
cellular membranes in your brain eggs are very keto friendly they're very low in carbohydrate
which will help you make ketones which the brain prefers and eggs are a great source of b12 b6 and
folate which the brain also needs so don't ever feel like these eggs are going to actually detract
from your health in any way like they're going to give you more cholesterol they're actually going
to support healthy levels of cholesterol your body will then make less but also you have a lot of
other benefits and one being supporting the brain hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of

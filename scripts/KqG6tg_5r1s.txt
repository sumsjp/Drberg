i want to increase your awareness on antibiotics
given to children early in life and the effects that that can create later in life there's a
very important link between what goes on in your digestive system and what happens
in your brain you have close to 100 trillion microbes both inside and outside your body most
of them living in your gut and if those microbes are altered in a certain way it can create huge
effects on both your cognitive state as well as your emotional state now if we talk about children
penicillin is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic and penicillin's derivative type
antibiotics in the u.s an average child receives three courses of antibiotics before the age of two
and these antibiotics change both the type of microbes living in your gut as well as
the number of microbes and the ratios of microbes to fungus living in your gut
that can then create all sorts of effects down the road one big effect of this altered microbiome
is an alteration in the gene expression of both the frontal cortex of your brain
as well as the amygdala in your brain which has a lot to do with fear responses and stress responses
and so if you have an altered gene expression of both the frontal lobe and your amygdala
this can affect your memory this can put you more in a fear state which is anxiety
as well as a stress state of having higher levels of cortisol and so antibiotics early in life can
affect the child's cognitive and emotional state later in life increasing the risk of depression
autism anxiety and adhd not to mention in other videos i talk about it affecting the immune system
increasing risk of getting allergies and asthma as well as slowing down your metabolism
and so the question is what can you do about it well the first thing is make sure these
antibiotics are really necessary far too often the doctor prescribes antibiotics for
viral infections when they don't do anything for viral infections
antibiotics only work on bacterial infections and so the great majority of antibiotics
are completely unnecessary now the other point i want to bring up about antibiotics
is to make sure the child is consuming uh food that is without antibiotics okay so
i would highly encourage you to buy foods that are organic grass-fed antibiotic free if the
child has to take an antibiotic make sure that they start taking probiotics at the same time
as when they're taking the antibiotics and after you stop taking the antibiotics because you want
to start building up the beneficial microbes that have been killed by the antibiotic now the other
point i want to bring up is that when a child gets sick i think it's really important to let
the child's immune system learn from being in your environment there's two types of immunity you have
what you're born with that's called your innate immune system that your mother has given you then
you have another part called the acquired immune system so every time the child gets sick if you
give them a medication or something to suppress the fever or get rid of the infection too fast i
think you're going to inhibit the acquired immune system in its ability to learn from this infection
and develop its antibodies and become stronger and it's also very important to allow the child to
live in the environment get into the soil get into nature and not live in a sterile environment where
there's no germs at all because it's the exposure to germs that our immune system has to then
adapt to and respond and then develop its immunity over time and lastly the immune
system is dependent on really key nutrients like zinc like vitamin d like calcium especially for a
child all right thanks for watching and stay tuned for more videos on children
and what you can do to raise a very healthy child hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of
my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

i wanted to do a video on something called edta and what it's good for now i'm not going to even
tell you what edta stands for it's this long chemistry name that you really don't even need
to know but here's what you should know edta is a chelator it's a metal chelator what does that mean
the word chile comes from the word claw so when you chelate you actually bind with the metal
and you pull it out so edta helps pull out certain metals and minerals out from the body and it's
also good for getting rid of mercury and lead poisoning so if you have too much calcium for
example or iron it can help pull those out but the problem is it pulls out other minerals too
like magnesium zinc and many other minerals so you have to make sure that you're putting back
in the minerals that you need while you're pulling out the minerals that you have too much of because
most of the symptoms related to edta relate to a zinc deficiency so as long as you're putting
some of these minerals back into the body you won't have the symptoms but some side effects
could be arrhythmias because it's pulling out magnesium and potassium hypocalcemia so
of course you would want to regulate this by not taking too much edta you take just certain amounts
you wouldn't want to necessarily take it every single day for a long period of time
it can create hypotension okay because it's pulling out salt it can also potentially cause
prolonged bleeding and cramps so make sure you put back in the minerals that you want
and not just pull everything out but what is this good for well it helps to decalcify your arteries
if you have calcium buildup in the arteries number two it helps reduce bile biofilms biofilms are
small igloos of calcium protecting microbes and biofilms are basically a survival mechanism that
microbes use to help protect themselves against antibiotics and other pathogens the problem is
they're related to a lot of diseases and heart disease and problems throughout your body
number three it can help produce something called ross which has to do with oxidation why because
you're getting rid of the metals that are creating more oxidation so you can help reduce this
oxidative effect before it can help reduce high blood pressure it can help reduce iron if you have
too much of it and a lot of men have way too much iron because the thing about iron is your body has
a hard time getting rid of it and so if you take it on a regular basis because you're eating a lot
of red meats or iron supplements or spinach or whatever you might not be able to get rid of it
and it can create some problems with your liver etc number six high calcium if you have too much
calcium i think this would be a good thing to help reduce that amount of calcium calcium is another
mineral that is difficult to remove from the body so if you're taking a lot of calcium in the diet
you might not be able to get rid of it and number seven high copper as in wilson's disease where
you can't get rid of this excess copper and is creating a lot of problems edta can help
counter excess copper all right thanks for watching and check with your doctor before
taking something like this especially if you're on medication especially if you have heart disease
because you'd want them involved in this process hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of

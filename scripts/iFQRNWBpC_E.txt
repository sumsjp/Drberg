you know the problem is you're told you have to do this blood thinner
which means now that you have to avoid all those leafy green vegetables that
have so many health benefits and now what do you do just avoid vegetables all together well this
video is going to talk about what to do to solve that problem if you were on warfarin also named
coumadin because that medication competes for vitamin k1 and so if you're consuming vegetables
high in vitamin k1 it's going to make that drug ineffective now the purpose of a blood thinner
is to prevent a clot from forming and giving you a heart attack or a stroke but just so you know
blood thinners don't actually make your blood thinner nor do they break up clots what they
do is they prevent the formation of new clots and they can slow the growth of existing clots now if
i personally had to take a blood thinner i would opt for the ones that don't have any drug food
interactions and i listed four on the whiteboard here so you can check it out and just check with
your doctor to see if that would be an option for you but if you're told you can't consume
certain green vegetables that are high in vitamin k1 i listed here a whole series
of vegetables that you need to avoid all the vegetables that are high in k1
and the ones that you can eat because they are low in vitamin k1 let me go through them right now
onions squash eggplant tomatoes mushrooms are okay cucumbers artichokes beets
bamboo shoots bell peppers all colors now the bell peppers like yellow has no vitamin k1 red have a
tiny bit and green have a little bit more but it's still on the low side avocados have low vitamin k1
white cabbage celery and cauliflower so instead of not consuming any vegetables
these are the ones that you would want to consume in a good amount so you can also get
your potassium and other vegetables and the ones to avoid are as follows nato is a fermented soy
collards kale spinach mustard greens brussels sprouts soybeans broccoli
lettuce except iceberg which is low in k1 and low and other nutrients as well and then red cabbage
now as a side note green tea does lower the effectiveness of blood thinners so you probably
want to avoid that as well all right so i also put these in the description so you can check that out

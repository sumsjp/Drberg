let's talk about how to get rid of your stiffness
in your body and feel younger again uh when i was
28 i was very very stiff i felt very very
old i felt like i was in my 50s now i'm in my 50s i'm 55 and i feel like
i'm in my 20s back then i had a lot of issues going on
and i was consuming a lot of carbohydrates and
that is something that i assume that everyone knows about
if you're doing a high carb diet that'll stiffen your joints up and create all
sorts of inflammation so i'm just assuming you
know that we're going to talk about the other common causes of stiffness one is
too much iron okay so iron creates a lot of
inflammation it creates problems in your liver and iron comes
from many sources like a lot of things are fortified with iron
especially if you're doing grains which i don't recommend you do or
even pasta and things like that also supplements some of the top
multivitamin mineral complexes come with way too much
iron iron doesn't really get eliminated from our bodies very well
especially in men and accumulates and it creates fibrosis and inflammation and
eventually even cirrhosis of the liver but it will definitely stiffen you up so
what you want to do is avoid iron now if you have a problem with excess iron
you also want to probably avoid red meat because it's loaded with iron
it's just a side note and you'll you'll notice your inflammation will start
coming down okay number two so-called vegetable oils
are really seed oils they're grain oils and you want to avoid them corn soy
canola cotton seed also safflower and sunflower or omega-6
these are omega-6 fatty acids and they're very inflammatory
and they're badly processed with solvents and
these are gmo as well and they can create a lot of
stiffness in your body so you want to avoid these for sure you want to replace
them especially when you're in cooking with
butter and maybe olive oil and coconut oil on your salad you can
use olive oil but just realize that the majority of olive oil sold out there
is not pure olive oil and i put a link down
below of a video that i did in olive oil so you can have
all the data on that but the point is that
if you're doing too much omega-6 and not enough omega-3
you're going to have an imbalance and create a lot of inflammation in the body
and stiffness there's a great test that you can do to pick up your ratios
but i suggest you start consuming more fatty fish
sardines cod of oil and fish oil be careful about fish oils do not do
like some low quality fish oil you want to do
something high-end because you get what you pay for and there's a
lot of bad things in these very inexpensive fish oils that you want to
avoid so you want to get a high quality
collard oil that'll probably be the best you can get
but the point is that this will give you the omega-3 fatty acids
omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies create inflammation pain and stiffness
so if you're on a low fat diet or you're a vegan realize that these
omega-3 fatty acids mostly come from fish
sardines you can get them from algae but you would have to get that in a
supplement but the point is that these are essential fatty acids they're
important and if you're not consuming them or you
don't like fish or whatever that can create inflammation right there
because you're going to be missing the omega-3 fatty acids
and the two primary ones i'm going to focus on are dha and epa
so just by taking this you'll notice that your stiffness will be much better
probably within one to two weeks next one is increasing vitamin k2 what
is that that is a type of vitamin that drives
calcium out of the joints out of soft tissue
into the bone and it works with vitamin d3 vitamin d3
also helps inflammation in your muscle and it gets rid of pain in your joints
as well so you might get great benefit by taking d3
and i always like to take them together what do we see as a common thread
between this one and this one and this one
well we're dealing with fats right so if you have difficulty
digesting fats okay because there's something going on with your
gallbladder what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to absorb
the essential fatty acids from the cod liver oil or the fish
oil or even the fatty fish so you're deficient so there's a lot of
people who have stiffness pain and inflammation and even
fibromyalgia from a gallbladder problem and it's
usually going to be on the right side in fact it's always going to go on the
right side on the left side it's probably going to be more of a
pancreatic type thing because the pancreas and the
gallbladder work together the gallbladder
concentrates bile bile is only made by your liver primary bile is made by your
liver secondary is made by your friendly
bacteria in your large intestine but what happens is the bile is created
it goes down to the gallbladder where it's concentrated
and then when you eat it's supposed to be released and it's supposed to break
down the fats into smaller particles
where now the pancreas can release lipase its enzyme
to take it down to even smaller particles so then your body can absorb
it in the small intestine so a lot of the fat is absorbed in the
small intestine and then if we keep going in the small
intestine right before we hit the large intestine
that's when a lot of the bile is supposed to be reabsorbed
and recycled so bile is recycled about 95 percent so if
there's inflammation in that part of your small intestine
then you're going to be boweled deficient as well
so you can be bile deficient from a problem in your liver
the gallbladder your intestine or the large colon
so there's a lot of other reasons why you might be deficient in bile
the point is that if you're deficient in bile you're going to get
stiff despite taking these remedies right here and so i'm
going to put some links down below to increase your awareness of the
gallbladder in relationship to pain and inflammation stiffness
but i had that problem for 12 years i didn't even know it was related
until one day i learned about it and never had pain there
ever again a good indicator to know if you have a gallbladder problem is a
fullness or tightness underneath the right rib cage
the remedy is to take purified balance salts if you want more information i put
a link down below on that but bile will help the absorption of
these right here so stiffness a lot of times is related to a lack of a
certain fat or the digestion of a certain fat
all right thanks for watching

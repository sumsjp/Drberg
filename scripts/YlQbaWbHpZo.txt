so let's talk about the number one reason why your child may be overweight
now you get all these interesting answers from people they'll say well
it's not exercising enough you'll say well they watch too much TV they're lazy
they're consuming too many carbohydrates which is true but there's a number one
reason carbohydrates would be number two but number one is snacking between 1977
in 2014 there's been a significant increase in the amount of snacking that
not only involved children but adults as well now here's the problem with
snacking you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and
especially the smaller intestine right turn here
that will activate and stimulate insulin after you eat so it's not just about the
carbohydrates it's the fact that your child is snacking in between the meals
that keeps the insulin high anything of any significant calories will trigger
insulin and insulin prevents the loss of fat as well as causes the storage of fat
so you got the number one reason is the frequency of eating and number two
definitely is the carbohydrates now if you combine that carbohydrate with a
snack not very good here are the most common snacks that kids are fed yogurt
and I'm not talking about eating plain yogurt talking about flavored yogurt
vanilla yogurt just 3.5 ounces gives you 13 grams of sugar then you have popcorn
which is low fat and fiber it's very very high on the glycemic index turns
into sugar and will spike the blood glucose very very fast and then we have
apple sauce which is basically concentrated sugar because it's taking
an apple with the fiber and then cooking it pasteurizing it so it's very very
high on the glycemic index as well before energy bars I mean the granola
bar for example has 19 grams of net carbs way too much now
juice is a snack as well you're drinking a very concentrated amount of sugar from
a fruit of course you don't get the benefits of the vitamins from the fruit
because it's going to be pasteurized so if you're consuming juice between the
meal you want to look at it as a snack as well this is probably the worst snack
right through here of all these and then we have number six crackers and peanut
butter now the problem is that peanut butter usually has added sugar so if
you're ever gonna do peanut butter make sure you read the label of course
crackers are very high in the glycemic index as well and then we have apples
now you might say well wait a second apples are fruit fruit has been altered
over the years to make it very very sweet apples on average contain 19 grams
of sugar and that's just way too much sugar in fact even before I started
doing keto I had a little pizza crust around my waist and I wasn't eating any
of these but I sure was eating a lot of apples so this whole concept of eating
an apple a day will keep the doctor away is not exactly true well maybe if you
actually shot the apple at the doctor hard enough it will keep the doctor away
but apples are definitely not on the list alright so if you have children and
you want to make a transition the first thing you need to do is go through your
cupboard and your refrigerator and get all the snacks that are higher in
carbohydrate out of the house just make some agreements that you're not gonna
carry it in the house anymore you can do it like a little gradual thing where you
replace it with celery and peanut butter without sugar cucumber and hummus might
be a alternative snack and then avocado and salsa might be a good snack as a
transition or even an egg but ideally you don't want to give your kids any
snacks have three meals okay make sure they're nutrient-dense make sure they
have enough calories and enough healthy fats but listen your kids don't need
snacks they're not going to starve to death in fact if you cut down the carbs
and the snacks you're gonna find your kids are
gonna be way more focused you're gonna find that their mood is so much better
their performance at school will be better because they're gonna be running
their brain on ketones not glucose not to mention the reduction of insulin so
they won't become a pre-diabetic and they will lose a lot of weight so you
want to cut out the snacks and definitely cut out the carbs if you're
new to keto and you want to know more about it I put the video right here to

hi guys in this video I'm going to talk about Ti a transient ischemic attack
okay this is kind of like a a mini stroke that's temporary that kind of
tells you that there's a stroke coming okay so it can be resolved within 24
hours so it's a temporary episode of neurological dysfunction caused by
decreased blood flow okay of the brain spinal cord or even in the eye so it's a
risk factor for stroke many people that get these they end up getting a stroke a
little bit later so some of the symptoms for a TIA or stroke would be
contralateral paralysis so if the stroke was on the left side of your brain
you're going to have problems on the opposite side if contralateral weakness
numbness loss of vision slurred speech can't comprehend confusion those are the
symptoms and sometimes there's not any symptoms at all so our three main
mechanisms let's start with the first one called an embolus what's an embolus
let's just envision you have this plaquing in the artery which is composed
of cholesterol calcium and fibrous tissue okay and part of that tissue that
plaque broke off and then plugged up a vessel somewhere else in your body that
would cause a TIA or stroke okay number two a thrombus a thrombus is just a
blood clot and most promises occur in the atrium of the heart the first
chamber of the heart it's like a primer pump before you get to the ventricle and
that comes from atrial fibrillation okay so you have this excessive beating of
the heart and then you get the stagnant blood and you get pooling and you get a
blood clot okay so it's going to block the blood flow to a certain part of your
body then we have an aneurysm okay and that's like a ballooning effect if you
could imagine blowing up a balloon and then eventually it's going to pop and
you're going to actually die of internal bleeding so that can actually happen as
well so now let's talk about what would cause an embolus well I have a lot of
videos on that you have this whole chain of events that occurs and it's not it's
not high cholesterol that's late in the chain the first
event is low vitamin C because there's an inflammatory condition or the person
has high levels of insulin that's why one of the risk factors of a stroke is
becoming a diabetic because the high insulin depletes the vitamin C starts
the lesion in the the cells and the artery and there comes the cholesterol
there comes the calcium here comes the fibrous tissue and you start building up
a clot so really this comes from high levels of insulin it comes from you know of
course junk foods it comes from vitamin C deficiencies then we have thrombus a
blood clot the most common cause is in the atrium of the heart
it's the chamber of the heart it's like a primer pump and that that comes from
having atrial fibrillation which is kind of like an erratic heartbeat to the
point where there's pooling involved then you get a clot so the question is
what causes atrial fib that's a potassium deficiency or a magnesium
deficiency so either you're not consuming seven cups of vegetables to
eat your potassium or avocados or you're consuming too much sugar you're
pre-diabetic giving some resistance and that alone is depleting the potassium
and the magnesium and by the way when you have insulin resistance you can't
pull in potassium anymore so you're going to be deficient so you have to fix
insulin resistance okay so that's one thing aneurism what causes the aneurysm
the lining on the vascular system starts becoming deficient in oxygen either
because the person has high blood pressure and that blood pressure is
causing damage on the arteries causing atrophy of the artery causing it to
balloon out from the high blood pressure and we know insulin resistance causes
high blood pressure and so does the path potassium deficiency but you can also
have smoking which will decrease oxygen in the vascular system you can have
plaquing on the arteries that damages the lining of the arteries to cause the
same mechanism you have low oxygen atrophy of the blood vessel ballooning
effect then you can have insulin resistance which causes inflammation
which decreases oxygen creates atrophy of the vessel and it starts to enlarge
and last thing will divide C deficiency which controls the collagen
so if you're lacking vitamin C your arteries get weaker okay so if if you
want to prevent a TIA or a stroke let's take a look
we need vitamin C we need to fix insulin resistance I'll put a link down below a
lot of vegetables high vitamin C we need to have a lot of potassium magnesium
it's in the vegetables we need to decrease the blood pressure naturally
using techniques for insulin resistance in a minute fasting we need to stop
smoking and if you already have a TI a or a stroke what do you do there's some
things you can do that actually are helpful there's a natural healthy fat
called DHA okay I would I had a stroke I would be consuming this by the
bucketfuls because this healthy fat has been shown to improve brain damage okay
number one it increases oxygen to the brain next thing niacinamide
that's vitamin b3 here's another natural remedy a vitamin
b3 that has been shown to regrow synapses and regenerate brain cells in a
minute fascinated with keto has been known to increase and regenerate brain
cells so these are the three things that I would do if I had this problem alright
put your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause
the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz
now and we'll send you report

all right so you have terrible sugar cravings and you're not on keto get on keto if you're new to
my channel very simply click the link down below and it'll show you exactly what to do
with the keto plan that will get rid of your sugar cravings but let's say you're
on keto and you have terrible sugar cravings that means there's something seriously wrong
because the way that you know you're in ketosis which ketones are the byproduct of fat burning
is that your cravings go away and you're no longer hungry so there's a couple things that
could be going on if you're on certain medications for example like prednisone
or anti-inflammatory or anti-depression medication or antibiotics these can all
increase cravings because they worsen your blood sugars also if you're under a lot of stress
that can do it as well or you have lack of sleep or even if you had an injury that can increase
cravings i'll give you an example i was riding my bike up a bridge and the pedal actually jammed i
went over the handlebars i landed on my elbow i actually fractured my elbow in 30 different pieces
and what was interesting well wasn't interesting it was very very painful but what was interesting
about is i started craving sugar very quick like i just needed some sugar because it dropped my
blood sugars it crashed it way way down because in the spike of cortisol which is a stress hormone
it just went up and my blood sugars went down all right so let's take a look at
potentially what you might be doing incorrectly so the first question is are you keeping your carbs
between 20 and 50 grams maybe you should start counting them and measuring them
but here's some mistakes about this 20 to 50 grams you are allowing carbs
that are very high in the glycemic index like straight sugar or dextrose or maltodextrin
you don't want to do that you want to avoid all carbs
when we actually are talking about 20 to 50 grams of carbs we're talking about not sugar carbs we're
talking about because you should avoid all those completely we're talking about like the carbs from
berries the carbs from nuts which are small amounts that's the type of carbs we're talking
about maybe the carbs that are in a hummus for example but not vegetables so if you're
consuming carbs that are high in the glycemic index like sugar and things like that yet it's
still within this range you're not going to get into ketosis because it's going to keep elevating
your um insulin which is going to keep you from tapping in the fat all right second problem
is you're eating too frequently you're not doing fasting you might be snacking in between the meals
remember eating makes you hungry so the goal is to eat nothing to go longer sometimes a
little apple cider vinegar and water will help reduce hunger that's a little tip there but
whatever you're doing as far as the frequency of meals you need to make it longer and the way that
you do that is you add more fat to the meal to go longer that's going to drop insulin and it's going
to get you into ketosis more and the more ketosis that you're in the less the cravings this should
happen within three days if you have very severe blood sugar issues it could take up to five days
but it will happen if you keep the carbs down and you fast longer and i'm talking about like
two meals a day that would be perfect like maybe your first meal is at 12 and your next one is at
six you should be fine the last thing and i think this is very important as well
consuming enough vegetables so a lot of times when people are in keto
it says to do low carb and vegetables are carbs so i'm just going to cut those out or they might
just have like one little tiny cup well in these vegetables you have some key nutrients
a lot of nutrients you have potassium you have magnesium and plus the fiber from the vegetable
is fed to the microbe in your gut which then releases something called butyrate and butyrate is
very helpful in balancing your blood sugars and giving your cells energy so you'll find that if
you include this right here it's going to be a lot easier you're going to be less hungry
you're going to be more satisfied and definitely less cravings because even when you take potassium
magnesium that alone decreases sugar cravings now last point i want to bring up is very important
when you do keto without doing intermittent fasting let's say you're having snacks with
the meal but it's keto friendly i found that you don't really see the benefits
many times you might not lose hardly any weight why because every time you eat you stimulate
insulin and we're trying to keep insulin lower so i highly recommend you don't do that you do
keto with fasting and then some other people do fasting but they eat whatever they want
okay so that's not good either because if you're eating junk food sugar high carbs that is going
to reduce your ability to see the benefits from fasting greatly okay so you want to do them both
together all right so those solutions should fix your cravings before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you

i'm going to show you how to avoid all the keto side effects okay in this one
simple video there's many things that happen but can be prevented if you know what to do
in the healthy keto program that i have which i'm going to put a link down below
which will explain everything if you do the correct eating plan from the very beginning
you shouldn't have any of these side effects it's when people try to
do sort of keto and they don't do it correctly that they end up having issues let's start at the
top here brain fog that can be a deficiency of b vitamins especially vitamin b1 and also ketones in
the transition phase when you're starting keto it takes like three days and sometimes there's this
transition period where your your brain doesn't have enough fuel it can't generate the ketones
it's fast enough and so you might want to increase your ketones by taking mct oil
okay and that can give you the ketones right away and the brain fog goes completely bye-bye
now also nutritional yeast can also help all right uric acid okay that's involved in gout
when you start fasting certain people start having higher levels of uric acid uric acid is
an antioxidant so it's trying to help you but if you're prone to gout you can notice pain in your
big toe okay so a simple solution is to take a green drink like wheatgrass juice powder in your
water which will alkalize you and alter the ph to the point where your immune system doesn't have to
create this inflammatory reaction anymore really simple solution you can also do potassium citrate
that works but a green drink also works like magic all right next one is high cholesterol i've done
a separate video on this but just so you know this might mean that you need some more bile salt
some more help with the gallbladder to help to break down this cholesterol but normally
it's not a problem all right kidney stone if you're prone to kidney stones
the most important thing to do is to drink no less than two and a half liters of fluid a day
that will keep things diluted you won't be able to form a stone because kidney stones are a
super saturated situation okay so if you drink enough fluid you just can't form stones anymore
also potassium citrate is really good because first of all potassium is a protective to the
kidney and it actually helps decrease the risk of kidney stones and the citrate also binds
with oxalates which are the most common form of kidney stones calcium oxalates so the citrate will
kind of prevent that and also from your diet you want to make sure you're not consuming
foods high in oxalates that would be almond and almond flour and almond butter spinach
chocolate which are all common foods on keto there's a lot more data to know about this
watch my videos if you're interested okay digestive problems if you get constipation or
diarrhea that's new for you you start the keto program all of a sudden you become constipated
or diarrhea most likely you need to adjust the vegetables you're either not having enough or
you're consuming too many so it's just a matter of comparing what you did before to now and if you're
eating a ton of vegetables it could mean that you need to cut cut it down because your microbes in
your gut can't digest and deal with all that fiber or it could mean that you need to increase the
amount of vegetables so just make some adjustments and that should help now if you get bloating
typically it means you're lacking bile now that could come for many reasons maybe you don't have
a gallbladder maybe you're just your liver is fatty maybe you're just sluggish but more bio
will help bloating now if you get abdominal pain that usually is lectins lectins are in vegetables
they're in beans they're in peanuts they're a lot of different foods so you may even need to cut out
your vegetables for a while and go carnivore just to get rid of that pain because you're
you might have leaky gut or some inflammatory situation that now you're sensitive to plants
so that's one point and then also if you have acid reflux that just means you need more acidifiers so
betaine hydrochloride is a good one apple cider vinegar is another good thing you can take that
will actually help keep that valve nice and close sometimes you need more b1 to help close the valve
on an occasion if you have like an ulcer which is not a side effect of gout but if you have an ulcer
zinc is probably one of the best remedies for that let's say you start getting acne that usually is
because you're you're sensitive to dairy i would just avoid the dairy and your skin should clear
up also dairy can enlarge either a fibroid in women or men can enlarge the prostate so
if you are a guy and have prostate issues or urination problems you might need to cut out
the dairy for a bit okay muscle cramps or heart palpitations same remedy you need electrolytes
magnesium potassium and sea salt all right next one you're irritable or you have headaches
you need vitamin b1 nutritional yeast is wonderful it should make you feel nice and calm within about
three minutes now you have gallbladder pain pain underneath the right rib cage that can refer to
the right shoulder up through here or the back that usually means that you need to cut down the
nuts and especially peanut butter why because most nuts are high in omega-6 which is inflammatory
and plus there are certain type of enzyme inhibitors which make them difficult to digest
in peanuts you have high levels of a certain toxin that comes from a fungus that can irritate
the gallbladder and create a lot of issues this is why you always want to do organic nuts
and valencia peanut or valencia peanut butter very very important because here's the thing
you might say well it doesn't matter if they spray these nuts because the shell is really really hard
right like walnuts it won't penetrate but what happens is when they crack the shell open
they spray after it's open so you want to do organic nuts and that should help you
but i think cutting out nuts would be good and you may need to cut out some of the extra oils
that you're consuming that you might not have enough bile to actually digest some of that fat
so taking a purified bile salts or a gallbladder formula very helpful in this situation
but usually when you take out the nuts problem solved all right bad breath this
is a temporary problem usually because you're not offsetting the high level of ketones with
something to neutralize that like leafy greens like large salads sometimes you're doing too much
protein so you want to make your protein moderate because too much protein can give off too much
ammonia and that can come off in the breath a rash keto rash that is usually a b vitamin deficiency
take nutritional yeast it's usually vitamin b2 and b3 that's deficient
when you start burning more fat and you're running off your ketones
the metabolic pathways are slightly different and you need certain nutrients and higher levels
definitely more b vitamins then we get the keto fatigue and keto flu that is usually just upping
the sea salt himalayan sea salt is the best and or taking potassium in a good electrolyte powder
that should handle that so sometimes if you have this blood pressure fluctuation that happens when
you start keto try increasing sea salt and then try decreasing and one of them usually will handle
it and you might need to also add potassium with even some vitamin d and that should should handle
it also the low salt can trigger more adrenaline which can then keep you up at night and you can
have insomnia which leads us to this point right here so you might need more sea salt if you're not
sleeping and sometimes a little calcium a good source of calcium would be of course calcium
citrate or lactate those are the two that i recommend all right there you go keto side
effects in a nutshell hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how

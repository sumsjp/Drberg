hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to talk about the three extremely stupid weight loss
tips okay number one is the eat less calorie tip that everyone is pushing out there first of all
you know one of things that you'll be told is that one pound of fat equals 3500 calories right
so if you just eat 500 calories less per day at the end of week you'll lose a pound right sounds
good and theory but what they're not factoring in is what the hormone system does to those calories
not all calories are treated the same fat has the most calories but it has the least effect on the
negative hormones so let's just take insulin for example in the presence of insulin you're
not going to lose weight I'm sorry it's just not going to happen well fat is almost neutral
but carbohydrates really spike that insulin so the point is it really depends on what calories
you're talking about it sounds good in theory but in actual fact it doesn't really work okay all
right number two everything in moderation this is another piece of bad information bad tip because
you don't you know you like it for you to consume a little bit of junk food in moderation here's the
day here's the true data did all it takes is a little bit of junk a little bit of sugar to pump
you out of fat-burning for at least 48 to 72 hours especially if your metabolism is slow and this is
what people don't realize is just they're thinking the calorie model they're not looking at hormonal
e what's happening to those calories this this advice allowing people to consume alcohol to lose
weight it's not good advice like I think even in that some of the USDA food pyramid recommendations
they say you women can drink one glass of alcohol per day men can drink two glasses of alcohol per
day and that's really under the weight loss that's bad information they're saying you can
have a moderation or a diet that you might see that oh yeah our diet works because we let you
eat the food that you really need to enjoy but in less amounts still that doesn't work it's bad
advice okay so you want to consume certain things in large quantities and other things in very small
quantities or zero quantities specifically sugar you don't want it any sugar in the diet now number
three your metabolism is slow because you're not eating enough that's the stupidest a tip
that I've ever heard in my life because if you're not eating because you're not hungry and you start
eating what's going to happen is you're going to spike insulin okay insulin is going to take that
food and that sugar or that you know store the glucose whatever is going to take it out of the
blood and it's going to drop your blood sugars now you can end up with low blood sugars guess
what you're going to be hungry your metabolism is not going to increase there's going to decrease
because you spike insulin so now you're going to eat again and now you're going to spike it
up now you're actually hungry all the time so eating promotes more eating okay eating
promotes more insulin so the rule of thumb is you never want to eat if you're not hungry okay
so it's not true that your metabolism is slow because you're not eating enough that's false
information metabolism is slow because you're probably eating too frequently or eating the wrong
thing all right so if also I have a really amazing quiz in the description box that you can take to
evaluate the real reason why you might have a slow metabolism check it out thanks for watching

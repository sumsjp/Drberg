hello dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about gout and ketosis in
certain individuals that are predisposed to having high uric acid crystals or
even kidney stones ketosis can aggravate the situation and in a minute fasting
can also cause a retention of uric acid in certain people - which doesn't
normally lead to gout but it can increase more uric acid so what are you
going to do about that well there's two simple things you can do because when
you have uric acid crystals one remedy would be lemon juice okay so that's thus
why recommend consuming a good amount of lemon juice in your diet when you do
this because it's going to actually counter oxalates uric acid and help
flush things out the other thing that you could do you can do the electrolyte
powder which is a thousand milligrams of potassium citrate potassium citrate is
really good for gout because it alkalizes this acidic state overly
acidic state and it helps reduce the symptoms of gout and helps neutralize
the uric acid buildup now one important point is that this uric acid buildup is
usually only in the first few weeks it's not when you're fully adapted to ketosis
it's it's in the adaptational I a lot of things shift and change when you're in
the keto adaptation phase you might have you know keto flu you know a rash
fatigue things like that and even like a flare-up of gout in summary it's
probably not going to be a problem for you but if you start feeling pain in
your big toe as a gout start increasing the potassium citrate or the lemon juice
alright thanks for watching hey you probably already subscribed but if you

now when we talk about exercise we have to talk about the different parts of exercise the anatomy
of exercise it's really simply composed of the duration the intensity the recovery and
the frequency how many times you do the duration intensity in a given workout and then you can also
talk about the frequency per week and so there's different variables to exercise that create
different effects for example duration if you exercise at a certain constant rate of exercise
over a long period of time let's say you're doing a marathon that tends to spike cortisol and the
third factor of recovery is very very important too especially if you're trying to lose weight
and especially if you're trying to get rid of soreness for example because if you over exercise
you over train and you don't get the recovery that puts a tremendous amount of stress on your heart
on the muscle tissue but today i want to talk about the importance of intensity so number one
doing a workout that has a sufficient amount of intensity can increase your aerobic capacity it
increases more capacity to deliver oxygen to your muscles and so more oxygen to the muscles
is going to get rid of the lactic acid buildup you'll have more endurance and overall you're
going to repair a lot better all right number two there's a greater reduction in cardiovascular
disease and premature death now you now this is interesting because you would think the more
intense you go the more dangerous this exercise would be but apparently not especially if you keep
your duration shorter and i think the reason why especially if you're comparing an intense workout
to let's say a moderate amount of intensity over a sustained period of time the sustained exercise
is working against the heart because it's not following a wave like pattern where you're doing
short duration high intensity short duration high intensity the heart works on the rhythm
so any type of exercise you can mimic a rhythm is a lot healthier than a sustained type of workout
all right number three significant improvement in insulin sensitivity so if you're a diabetic
if you are a pre-diabetic if you have insulin resistance or you're in keto you're trying to
speed up the results which is all about improving insulin resistance and reducing insulin the
intensity of exercise is what you should focus on all right number four intensity is a potent
trigger to increase growth hormone now what is growth hormone it's a hormone that's made
by your pituitary it works through the liver and it's an anabolic hormone that means it
builds things up builds your muscles up it helps you make certain proteins other
proteins other than muscle protein it helps grow your bones it helps grow your organs
and as you get older it starts going down so after the age of 50 it's very important to do
some form of exercise that involves intensity with a lot of recovery also growth hormone is all about
calcium retention in the bone fat burning it's anti-aging it helps your immune system
and it helps you convert t4 to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone interesting so intensity is
a potent trigger to growth hormone you also have sleep delta wave sleep that's when you trigger the
majority of growth hormone also having low blood glucose can help stimulate growth hormone that's
keto right low carb vitamin b3 niacin can help stimulate growth hormone fasting is a potent
trigger of growth hormone keeping your stress low will also help you enhance growth hormone because
when as soon as you increase cortisol from stress you diminish your growth hormone and of course the
last one which i already mentioned the intensity of exercise is a potent trigger for growth hormone
before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

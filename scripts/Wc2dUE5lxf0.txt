let's talk about one of the best nutrients for improving your thinking and that would be choline
now choline was once considered one of the b vitamins but now it's considered kind of
a standalone vitamin but choline which by the way is a kind of a lemon tasting vitamin you can even
suck on them and they taste like a little lemon drop it's a required nutrient by your body because
it's a primary building block of something called acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter for your
brain neurotransmitters work like hormones but instead of traveling through the blood
they travel through the nervous system so it's involved in communication as
improving new memories it's involved in certain processes that influence reasoning concentration
focus cognition which is understanding things sleep growing synapses in your brain cells
and coordinating movements especially movements involving speed and accuracy and there's some
really interesting research on this i'm going to put it down below of people taking choline and
noticing some significant improvements in these right here now if you're deficient in choline
you have a tendency to get brain fog you have problems with the tension and focus you can even
develop brain fatigue decreased ability to learn things memory loss poor recall get distracted
easily which is part of this right here and becoming irritable other than that you'll
be pretty good now the question is where would you get choline in your diet number one source
beef liver just 2.4 ounces will give you 290 milligrams shrimp is a good source of choline
4 ounces provide 153 milligrams but just one egg will give you 146 milligrams i personally consume
a lot of eggs and then we have scallops four ounces of scallops will give you 125 milligrams
now there's a lot of other foods that will provide choline including even leafy greens but these
are probably the best sources right here and so if you have some of these symptoms right here
and you want to improve these and you're starting to consume these foods or even taking colon as a
supplement and it doesn't work there's something else that is a requirement to make sure this works
and that is making sure that your diet is correct you're avoiding certain things
that deplete choline and for that information i put a link down below if you're new to my channel

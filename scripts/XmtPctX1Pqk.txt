let's talk about how long it takes a diabetic to potentially
go blind diabetic related retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness
one out of every four diabetics develop this condition
and they're on their way to go blind but that's not the only thing that happens
the feet go numb you get chronic systemic infections the
kidneys go bad the heart goes bad and you lose brain
function if you're a diabetic new to my channel you're going to be very happy
that you're watching this video because this is going to really help you if you
understand this simple concept high levels of blood
glucose cause bleeding of the tiny capillaries
in your eyes right around the retina the retina
is the extension of your brain it's the thing that you use to see
it's a nerve tissue and it's fed with capillaries
and high sugar destroys the blood flow to the nerve
but not just the nerve the feet the kidneys the heart and the brain
and then what happens in the eye is you get all sorts of collateral blood
vessels that the body is trying to drive blood
flow to an oxygen but what eventually happens is the
retina dies simply because of lack of nutrients
in oxygen and this is completely unnecessary
and can be easily avoided the longer the exposure of glucose on the eye
tissue will determine the complications ten years of chronically high blood
sugars start developing complications of
diabetes and in the next 10 years things get
worse and worse and worse so if you're testing your blood sugars
with an a1c test that would mean that it's
over eight and i have a little story i want to tell you about i
i was in practice for 29 years and i saw a lot of diabetics come in for
all sorts of neuropathies and pain syndromes
and i remember working on this lady and her husband kept coming in with her
and he had diabetes and it just he was taking medication and trying to
keep it controlled but it was always on the high side and i
kept talking to him and his wife kept begging him
to change his diet and he didn't his awareness wasn't there so anyway
one day he came in with his wife with those little canes with glasses he
actually went blind so i've seen it happen myself and it's
just it's sad completely unnecessary let's say for example you
were diagnosed last year with diabetes you might
be thinking oh i have nine more years to go before i start getting
complications what you have to realize is this
high blood sugar situation has been hidden for
many years before you were diagnosed probably
20 maybe even 30 years in other words it takes a very long time
of having insulin resistance before the cells of the pancreas the beta cell
starts losing its function to the point where
you don't have enough insulin and now this mechanism right here is no longer
working and then if the insulin goes down now
the blood sugars go up you may already be experiencing
other complications like fatigue especially after you eat
lunch or maybe you have to get up several times a night
or you're constantly thirsty or you're constantly peeing
or you have skin tags or you have poor circulation there's many other
complications there's some things that are really
really important and things that are not very important the most important
thing is to bring your carbs way down your
diet okay if you're new to my channel and you
don't know about the keto plan and you don't know about imminent
fasting i put a very important link to watch and learn and apply this
because if this is not too bad yet you could potentially reverse some of
this just with your diet alone in the meantime there's a very important
nutrient that you can get i don't sell it you can get it from any
health restore or online it's called benfotamine i'll put
the spelling down in the description but it's called benfotamine
and you'd want to take four of those capsules
per day what that nutrient can help you do
is immediately reduce the complications because it
helps to counter some of the free radical damage that's destroying the
capillaries but of course that's not going to work
long term unless you reduce your carbs and start doing
fasting so check out the link down below and learn more about it
hey we're back with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto
absolutely not karen and it's an immune system builder
absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the
recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy
to be keto but is it simple it's super simple we
hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying

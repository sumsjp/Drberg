so you want to do fasting for fear related disorders i'm talking about anxiety panic attacks
ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and phobias now fear is an emotion that helps you survive but
what happens when our body becomes in a chronic state of fear and how does that influence our
bodies not good and the question is what can we do about it well one of the most powerful
things you can do is you can do fasting there are many many things that fasting can do for the brain
for your immune system for your cognitive function and for your mood now when i say mood i'm talking
about elevating your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state and
now there's several mechanisms behind why this works but fasting is also a survival mechanism
that helps you survive in times of danger so it tends to counter this fear of motion especially
supporting your adrenal glands also a little structure in your brain called the amygdala
which is very similar to the adrenals but for the brain and so they found the amygdala in the brain
has everything to do with fear and then you have something called the sympathetic nervous system
as in the flight or fight mechanism and the location of that is inside your adrenal glands
because there's two parts you have an outside and inside it's on the inside and also in all of the
mid back nerves you have the sympathetic nervous system so there's studies that show that fasting
helps your adrenal glands your sympathetic nervous system which is part of the autonomic nervous
system and also it can help your amygdala so if you're stuck in this fear band whether it's a
low-level fear or a level fear like in panic attacks or whatever
you can do fasting to pull yourself out so fasting will improve your mood it improves gaba which is
a neurotransmitter that makes you calm it will improve dopamine which helps increase pleasure
which then counters stress hormones like cortisol and fasting can actually reduce cortisol directly
and reduces that flat or fight mechanism as improving sympathetic nervous system
dominance and so if you're new to my channel and you really want to start out doing something very
very easy just start doing intermittent fasting even without changing your diet okay as a step one
then you're going to find that it's going to be easier to change your diet so then you can start
eliminating carbs okay that's called keto i put a link down below of that plan and it'll walk you
through this step by step but the main thing with fasting is you don't want to eat if you're not
hungry so many people eat breakfast as a routine thing thinking that it's a healthy thing to do
even though they're not hungry if you're not hungry don't eat especially in the morning instead
do two meals a day one at lunch one at dinner make sure you don't have anything between those meals
then you're doing intermittent fasting very very simple that will give you 18 hours of fasting
from your last meal to your first meal you're going to start seeing some magical things happen
when you fast for 18 hours now there's many things you can do to enhance this you can start adding
mct oil which your brain will love you can start adding b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast
especially vitamin b1 that's going to help a lot and then also adding more fat to the meals
to make you more satisfied so you can go longer not to mention most of your brain is made of the
fat and so you're supporting your brain just from adding that fat all right there you have it thanks

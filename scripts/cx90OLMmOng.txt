okay guys I wanted to create a little video on how you would I don't know
present this information one-on-one with someone let's say you're at a dinner
party or you're in the elevator and you don't have a lot of time but you want to
explain keto intermittent fasting in a way that gets them interested okay I
mean it could could be done and a webinar but I want to explain a concept
okay so the first thing is you can see the guy has a huge belly and you want to
tell him this now assuming they have a resistant stubborn weight problem which
is usually the case you just say listen there's an easier and faster way to lose
fat okay well you do want to know about it right there he's gonna go really yeah
faster easier okay yeah so when you have fat burning or losing weight people will
usually tell you need to eat less and exercise more everyone knows that
but no one's successful doing this okay and that is because the information that
they're using is completely and utterly false it's not true so in other words if
you're trying to do anything I don't care what it is to be successful you
have to have the correct information right does that make sense
yeah try to um let's say you're gonna you're a student and you're studying
something wouldn't it be helpful to have the correct information how to study how
to learn something or let's say you're in it you're in a marriage
wouldn't it be helpful to learn how to communicate first or let's say you're
doing public speaking and you don't know anything about communication well you're
not going to be successful so the same thing with trying to lose weight no one
knows how to burn fat correctly okay so because they're losing weight they're
losing water weight and muscle weight but they don't know about the fat cell
so I'm gonna show you three things powerful things that rarely do people
know to the level they need to relating to the fat cell do you want to know this
okay they go yeah I want to know so there's three things you must know
fazt number one hormones control fad and I'm talking about the storage of fat and
the burning of fat okay hormones control fat and fat burning the
release of fat requires an enzyme okay a certain enzyme an enzyme is the thing in
your body that does the work it helps break things down and it's called
hormone sensitive lipase lipase comes from the Greek word which means lippo or
fat and ace means an enzyme so it's a certain kind of the dissolver for fat
okay and it's triggered by a hormone okay and is triggered by the decreasing
of insulin okay so in other words anytime insulin decreases this enzyme is
triggered and you burn fat okay that's the most important thing okay so you're
teaching them something that is very very important okay number three here's
some ways to lower insulin that are very not known they're uncommon but they're
very powerful number one you can't go on a low-fat diet when you do low fat low
fat proteins you trigger insulin so the more lean protein is the more low fat a
protein is okay the more you're gonna you're gonna spike insulin because
consuming fat is the only food that doesn't trigger insulin Wow now you
probably you haven't heard that in a while have you
I mean take a look at the the American Heart Association the American Diabetes
Association the American Society of obesity the authorities the the
mainstream recommendation what do they recommend low fat high carb yeah so you
see the problem so it's not your fault that you couldn't lose weight it's not
your little willpower it's not your laziness you've just been given the
wrong information yeah that's why you're not losing weight
okay number two these healthy snacks between the meal to keep the blood
Sugar's up to keep from overeating the recommendation by a mainstream bad
idea because every time you eat anything you're gonna treat trigger insulin so
people are doing these protein shakes protein bars between meals to elevate
their blood Sugar's or grazing at night on so-called healthy foods fruit nuts
guess what you're spiking insulin yeah so you want to do the least frequent
meals possible okay last one no more healthy grains
okay these so-called heart healthy whole grains it's pure sugar it's gonna turn
to sugar really fast even faster than sugar so whether something is refined
grain or whole grain it still breaks down the sugar even faster than
consuming table sugar on the glycemic index it's actual it's higher than
actual sugar yeah so that's what's keeping you fat right here and of course
you want to avoid the carbs as well there's a whole list of other things too
but these are just things that people don't realize okay those are the three
most important things you need to know about the fat cell and fat burning and
what I do is I have a program that is designed to help undo the damage help
you lose weight but mainly to get healthy then lose the weight as a
natural consequence of getting healthy it's it's a long-term lifestyle it's not
a diet so there's two strategies we use healthy keto and intermittent fasting
it's very powerful would you like a business card okay good I'll set up a
free consult so that's kind of how you would present it you have to practice it
but I think that would actually shift someone's viewpoint and get them very
interested okay thanks for watching

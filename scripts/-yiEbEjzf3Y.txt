now this is amazing stats 97% of all dieters not only regain the weight back but then some why
is this well i think it's because they don't have a second goal they spend all this work
reaching this goal they lose the weight is their weight loss somehow going to be fixed where they
don't have to do anything where they can just have it run an automatic and go back to their
lifestyle or do they have to maintain it it's very similar to a marriage where you meet someone
then you decide to get married and then you get married and then you expect it to continue
on automatic right well that definitely doesn't work i mean you have to find out what your partner
wants what you want and exchange back and forth right because if you're only expecting to give
them what you want and you don't give anything in exchange you end up with what's called a divorce
well the same thing happens with the body you have to find out what it wants and needs and then
it will give you what you want pleasure sensations the feeling of being healthy etc so what does your
body really want well it wants actual real food what's the definition of food it's a combination
of fuel and nutrients now what's very interesting about this is that the true flavors of food happen
to come with the nutrients the nutrients aren't necessarily flavorful so the flavors attract us to
the food with the highest nutrients now the cool thing about this is it's a perfect match because
the thing that you really want which is food that's flavorful right well just so happens to
be the exact same foods with the key nutrients i mean i don't know if you've ever actually tasted a
real tomato and how pleasurable all those flavors are i mean that is a pleasurable sensation now it
is true that doritos are very flavorful and so is kfc but they come with a little bit of a package
so i think we should just stick with real food right so you give your body what it really needs
nutrient dense foods and then it will give you what you really want which is health and so if
you really want the best solution to maintain your weight don't have a weight loss goal have a get
healthy goal something that you can exchange with your body by giving it what it wants
so it can then give you not just a healthy body but weight loss is a byproduct of getting healthy
and oh by the way carb cravings is not really a natural thing it's something that our bodies
are conditioned once you start it becomes more of a craving an addiction but it's not a natural
thing so when you get healthy you're going to find that the whole carb cravings are not even
a problem anymore because they're not natural in the first place hey before

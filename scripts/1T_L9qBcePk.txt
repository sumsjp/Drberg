if you're interested in strengthening
your bones and you have
osteopenia or osteoporosis
there is a very important mineral that
you need to be aware of in fact
it's the missing mineral for bone
strength especially for hardening the
outer part of the bone
and that's called strontium okay
strontium is a trace mineral
it's a mineral that's needed in very
very small amounts
now we all know that calcium is
important in strengthening bone
and you need calcium in a certain amount
and strontium
is very similar in its chemistry to
calcium
but it's not needed in very large
amounts
but you need it in certain amounts and
so the ratio of strontium to calcium
is one to a thousand so we need a lot
more calcium
but we do need strontium and if you're
deficient in this mineral then the bones
aren't going to be as strong
there's two very interesting studies the
first one was started in 2000
i went to 2004 it was a total of three
years it was a randomized
double-blinded placebo-controlled study
and they found a
decrease in risk of bone fracture by 41
percent
pretty significant another study in 2008
showed a decrease in bone fracture
by 36 pretty significant so if you have
a bone situation and you want to
really make sure your bones become
normal again
definitely add this trace mineral to
your protocol in fact i would add this
trace mineral
i would add calcium in the form of
aspartate
anhydrous i would also add vitamin d
as well as vitamin k2 as well as
magnesium
i'm going to put a link down below for
more details on that but that's what i
would recommend
for building bone in a blend of
all of the trace minerals because a lot
of these other minerals are involved as
well
now the interesting thing about this
trace mineral
straw tim is that it's also involved
in a very specific type of phytoplankton
called acantharian okay
now this microorganism which is
not really plant or animal or fungi it's
this other thing which i don't want to
get into but it's a
living organism and it's a microplankton
which is a very very small of plankton
normally plankton lives in the sea
and whales and other fish consume it and
it fossilizes
and it ends up in the bottom of the
ocean and it's
normally high in silica however this
specific phytoplankton
it's not made with the normal silica
that other phytoplankton use
it's created with strontium
so it's very very unique and the
architecture of this
microorganism is fascinating
it's these brilliant designs that are
multi-colored with blue and gold
i think it would give someone a great
idea of making some
amazing jewelry but these little
creatures have these little
protruded spikes they give off this
little food to entrap their prey
so they can also live now one last point
about stronium in this
plankton is that it doesn't fossilize
so it gets dissolved once that organism
dies so then strontium can then
recycle and circulate through the
seawater and so one good source of
strontium
is a high quality sea salt which i'm
going to recommend
if you're also interested in preserving
your bones
and making sure you have a lot of the
minerals that the bones need
hey before you go real quick i have a
course
entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system
it's a free course i want you to take it
and here's why
here's here is your
environment everyone
is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here
what about strengthening
your immune system that's what's missing
this course will show you
how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment
much better
by strengthening your own immune system
i put a link down in the description

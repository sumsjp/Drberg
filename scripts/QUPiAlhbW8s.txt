had a comment recently that i wanted to create a video on
uh someone had their blood pressure go up after starting keto so i decided to
create a video to explain what that is now there's
something called glycogen glycogen is basically stored glucose so we have a
glucose molecule and when you store glucose molecules in
a chain in a group it's called glycogen
and glycogen needs potassium to be stored
for every molecule of glucose that's attached it needs one molecule of
potassium also one molecule of glucose
holds or retains three to three and a half
molecules of water so with each one of these little glucose
molecules that are attached you have three plus
molecules of water so when we think of glycogen we can really think of a sponge
you're holding a lot of fluid all right so that's concept number one
glycogen is stored sugar it holds a lot of water
it also stores potassium concept number two
this glycogen is stored in the liver and your muscles primarily it's it's
stored in other places but those are the two places it's stored
when you do keto and you lower your carbs
and you do fasting okay intermittent fasting or
fasting you are going to deplete your liver glycogen now if you fast for
a little bit longer time you're going to really deplete your
liver glycogen down to almost zero so now you're just left with the
glycogen in your muscle so think about this you're going to get
rid of all the stored glucose which comes with this water which comes
with this potassium you're going to drop a lot of extra
fluid and electrolytes with an s because there's other
minerals that go along with this so when you lose water you lose
electrolytes in general but we're also losing
more potassium one of the main causes of hypertension
especially essential hypertension which is about 90 percent
of all cases of hypertension and by the way essential means
unknown cause there's some great data that shows that this essential
hypertension is really a potassium deficiency
okay remember we just talked about that so when you do
keto not only do you lose potassium sometimes the requirement for potassium
goes up because we're converting over to fat
burning as well and if you're already deficient in
potassium and now you're really deficient in potassium
your blood pressure could go up so how do we solve this
well we just do the healthy version of keto
start consuming more vegetables like seven to ten cups
things that are loaded with potassium avocados are a good thing to eat as well
so we do this we get more potassium hopefully the blood pressure can come
down you may also want to enhance your diet with some extra potassium
like a thousand milligrams potassium per day just to kind of speed things up
all right thanks for watching before you go
if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug
because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you this is just for the people in the us
hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call
and get some help

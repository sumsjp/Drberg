hi dr. Berg here in this video we're gonna talk about the ketogenic diet and insomnia some people
actually have sleep problems when they start this eating plan so we're going to go through
all the different scenarios that could cause this and what we can do about it number one too much
coffee equals too much caffeine which affects too much central nervous system stimulation
preventing you from going to sleep in fact one of the causes of insomnia is dis excessive caffeine
so I would keep it down to one cup in the morning okay now before bed not two or three or a big one
just a small one in the morning if you can do that I think you're going to be much better off
alright number two not doing in a minute fasting keep your genetic diets don't really talk about
avoiding snacks so if you did three meals a day with two snacks and ate at night and it was all
like fat and some protein or whatever you're going to have too much food in your system and you're
still going to spike insulin and that's still going to keep you from sleeping so you really
want to do the ketogenic with intermittent fasting too together especially if you're not sleeping and
the three you're bloated because you introduce kale you saw my video on the kale shake and the
kale is healthy so now you're eating a lot of kale well you you're not used to digesting it so you're
getting all this bloating if that's the case you're going to have to go to other vegetables
and not to kale because that bloating is going to create stress there's a lot of nerves in your
digestive system that connect to the brain and so it's going to keep you restless and uncomfortable
change the vegetable number four low potassium when you do ketogenic diet in general you use
more potassium they're doing very small amounts of vegetables and they're not getting their
potassium so we need to beef that up and then you could supplement with potassium potassium citrate
you can do the electrolyte powder if you want but that will also help calm the nervous system down
because you're going to need more potassium and so you could end up with a potassium deficiency
if you don't consume enough potassium foods low vitamin B1 is another vitamin that you're going to
use more when you're adapting to this ketogenic mechanism so you're going to need nutritional
yeast without b1 you can feel restless you can have restless leg syndrome you can feel nervous
tension especially getting to sleep faster it's like if you don't have b1 you you're going to
kind of lay there and just start thinking a lot so it's going to affect a lot of brain chatter number
six low calcium in order to do a ketogenic diet your body does require a little more calcium so
if you're deficient you might notice leg cramps or even the difficulty getting to sleep this is
actually quite common adding a little calcium you can do calcium citrate calcium magnesium right
before bed will enhance your ability to sleep okay number seven waking up with blood sugar
fluctuations either in the middle of the night or you wake up really really really hungry okay
that means you haven't adapted yet you're still in that phase where your body is adjusting and
the best thing for that is apple cider vinegar in water right before bed a two tablespoons in some
water drink that down boom now if you're concerned about getting up and urinating consume it maybe an
hour and a half before you go to sleep but it will definitely help your blood Sugar's alright thanks

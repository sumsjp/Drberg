hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about a charley
horse if you've ever had one of these right before you go to bed or when
you're in the middle of a dead sleep where your calf just cramps up it can be
excruciating okay but it's really a good thing because it tells you what you're
deficient in it's like a little red light an indicator to tell you or you're
deficient in one of these electrolytes okay
an electrolyte is a mineral that works with either the electrical system of the
body or the muscle system to allow muscles to contract and relax or nerve
impulses to travel okay so the main two minerals that are involved with charley
horses are calcium and magnesium so the first thing that it always recommend for
people that are charley horses is just take a calcium magnesium you can take it
as a tablet take it before bed okay don't take it when you're eating food
why because this isn't these are alkaline minerals and they can
neutralize the food and they're best absorbed on an empty stomach
so you take these right before bed and that should eliminate the charley horse
now if it doesn't then it's a potassium deficiency why because potassium is
needed in a lot larger amounts and if you're not consuming enough vegetable
like seven to ten cups like in some of my videos I talked about then you could
be low in potassium and potassium is needed to help these be absorbed so
really without potassium you can't absorb the calcium magnesium or some
people take this it gets rid of it but they have to keep taking it over and
over and over okay so basically you want to use this as a tool to kind of force
your body to start eating better because if you're not eating enough greens
you're probably not going to get magnesium either so the goal is just not
to depend on a pill but to fix the diet but if you're doing my eating program
which basically is a lot of vegetables and you're doing some proteins and doing
some healthy fats and you're in fat burning the one that most people become
deficient in eventually is the calcium because they're not necessarily doing a
lot of you know dairy so they might need to add more cheese to
get this calcium right here okay and plus when you're burning fat you
sometimes you actually lose a little bit calcium it's called ketosis so you might
need to add a little calcium magnesium before you go to bed but the biggest
indicator is that if you point your toes all the way straight and you get a cramp
then you better take these two because these two work together to contract and
relax the muscle okay so very simple solution go ahead and do it and write
your comments below I'll see you in the next video

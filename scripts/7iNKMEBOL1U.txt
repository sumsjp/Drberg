so i remember someone was showing me this plank exercise right and i was
kind of like that's so easy that's not really a workout that's not going to do anything
and so i actually tried it and i was shocked how difficult it was at the very beginning but there's
some really cool benefits from doing this plank exercise so what is it it's an isometric type
exercise where you're not contracting your muscles you're stationary and so there's a modified
version or the regular version what's called the front plank and the modified version you're
on your knees and you're on your forearms and your entire spine from your head all the way to
the bottom part is straight it's neutral you're keeping your shoulders back and down and you're
not bending at the hip level so that would be modified and then you have the regular type
where you're doing like a push-up but you're on your elbows and you're maintaining that position
and there's a lot of other variations to that which is more advanced so you start out doing
between one and six reps one set you're going to hold that position for at least 10 seconds but you
want to work up to a minute and so you're going to rest between 30 and 90 seconds i'm telling you it
looks really easy but it's very difficult in the beginning and it's quite a workout you're going to
feel it the next day let's talk about the benefits of a plank exercise it can build your core what
is the core the core is something that connects the upper torso to the bottom part of your legs
you have the abdominal muscles the back muscles the side muscles the hip muscles and the
buttocks it can help your posture it can help the relationship between your chest and your mid-back
and your shoulders and your neck it can keep your head over your spine so it's not too forward this
way number three it actually can help symmetry between the front part of your body and the back
part of the body as far as strength because if you're asymmetrical that can produce pain
in your joints especially your lower back now number four it strengthens the tendons
the ligaments and the muscles because you have to hold this position for a long period of time
number five it can create a lot of stability in your core so and what i mean by stability is it
can keep your back from being unstable and it can help your coordination when you walk
and it can just reduce pain in your lower back number six you can actually get a workout
by doing this exercise talking about sweating and definitely feeling sore the next day it's
also really good to mesh in with other types of exercises all right number seven like all

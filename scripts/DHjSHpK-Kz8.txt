so i have a question is depression really a disease well the way they diagnose
major depressive disease is through these nine behaviors or symptoms if you have five
or more of them then you have major depressive disease but those five or more have to include
number one and two depressive mood or a decreased interest in pleasure or having no pleasure
okay so let's go through these symptoms depressive mood decrease interest and pleasure
increase or decrease in appetite or weight before increase or decrease in sleep
five fatigue or loss of energy six feeling of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt
seven decrease ability to concentrate number eight agitation or
retardation which has a little different definition retardation in this definition means
you're slowing down the body or slowing down the mind okay number nine recurrent thoughts of death
or suicide okay so these are all the different characteristics and you have to have five or more
that must include either number one or two to have this disease now here's the question i have
what objective test can you do okay is there a blood test is there a cat scan that can show
something wrong with the body and where is the problem located exactly they have not found that
out and so this is really based on opinion it's very arbitrary what i would like to know is why
not look at these other factors which are a lot more objective the diet okay what is the person
eating is it possible that what they're eating can cause an imbalance in blood sugars and actually
cause them to be depressed i found that diet is a huge influence over someone's mood you can measure
objectively the vitamin d levels if you're low in vitamin d one of the symptoms is depression
you can also measure testosterone if you're low in testosterone one of the symptoms could be
depression you can measure the thyroid if your thyroid is deficient you have hypothyroidism
one of the symptoms is depression if you're low in vitamin b1 if you're severely low it can affect
your cognitive function to the point where you could be depressed you can measure that as well if
you don't have enough sleep you can feel depressed the feeling of depression and the feelings of
exhaustion and lack of energy and vitality are very similar one time i was in practice
and this lady was in the room and she came in and she was depressed and i tested her and the test
was called heart rate variability and it measured something called the autonomic nervous system
and it was literally flatlined i mean there was nothing going on i've never seen a test
that bad ever and so that really indicated a lot of problems including exhaustion and so
i looked at the test and i said i understand that you're depressed but honestly based on this test
right here i think you're completely exhausted and you know what happened
she instantly felt better because someone finally found something that was more objective and i said
do you feel depressed now she goes actually no i don't feel depressed right now in fact i don't
even feel tired just by knowing what her problem was that was fascinating all right um you can be
fatigued from lyme disease epstein-barr virus other viruses anemia lack of iron you can even
have chronic pain in your body and inflammation that can actually make you depressed so the
question is is depression really disease go ahead and comment down below and tell me what you think

hey guys one of the biggest problems that you run into is trying to find
something to put your butter on did that come out right sure yeah well the way I
say it is you need a vehicle for the butter a vehicle I need a vehicle
for the butter other than bread crackers and pancakes although I
make English muffins and pancakes and waffles wheat-free sugar-free so I can
put butter on that but I stumbled across this recipe it was actually called a
biscuit recipe it's not reminiscent of a biscuit it's actually like a little
piece of bread and the texture it's like four ingredients texture is really cool
it's very bready as a matter of fact I don't have it right here but when this
recipe posts I will have worked out the measurements for a loaf pan because it
rises beautifully and you can slice it and I think it's it would make awesome
toast even sandwich bread it really holds together nicely yeah and we have
the grass-fed butter yeah it's actually cows eat the grass not the butter eats
the grass grass-fed butter it doesn't sound right mm-hmm you're gonna like this mm-hmm
is it hard to make what do you think it's very simple right
the texture is really great and you know when it comes down to it bread doesn't
have gobs of flavor it's a vehicle for the butter so many people like bread and
muffins so you know you should sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you but I was just
gonna say another thing I love to do with bread is dip it in like an Italian
oil warm this up and soak it in some Italian oil or something it would be a
good solution a good alternative absolutely Charlie so check this out how
to make it and I think it'll be very easy for you

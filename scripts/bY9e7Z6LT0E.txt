so i have a question what is better for sleep exercise or physical work like yard work cleaning
you know building something fixing something remodeling something or just your job where
you're using your physical body i'm not talking about sitting behind a desk of course but actual
physical work what is better for sleep what do you think personally i think physical work is probably
10 times better for your sleep and reducing stress than actual an exercise that you would do at the
gym or even at home so let's first take a look at the similarities both increase oxygen increase
muscle activity can increase your endurance can decrease stress but with exercise it's very
predictive it's very structured it's repetitive it's a really focused intentional motion activity
where you're normally working symmetrical muscles so you might start off with the left side and
do the right side or both at the same time but for physical work it's not really predicted
or structured it's very asymmetrical which is in some ways actually very very good plus your mental
focus is a lot different you're not concentrated just on your body you're focused on something
else and so for mental health and for mental reduction of stress physical work is way better
than exercise because you're getting more of your attention out of your head onto other things
not just necessarily doing a bicep curl or a bench press now i think both is important but
if you want to sleep better i would highly recommend doing more physical work and you
can actually simulate physical work with exercise but when you're doing physical
work you are using usually your whole body and you can actually get very very sore even though
it might not think you're doing much if you have problems sleeping i challenge you to do at least
one to two hours of physical work around the house and just see if you don't just sleep a lot better
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system

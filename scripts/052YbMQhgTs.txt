hey guys in this video I'm going to talk about sleepy after eating do you get
sleepy after you eat sometimes people think that's a normal thing it's not
normal to be tired after you eat okay it usually comes from two different reasons
number one when you eat you trigger insulin because and that makes that
means the blood sugars are going to go high it's like kind of after
Thanksgiving meal everyone wants to take a nap because there's high sugar okay so
if you're taking putting these breads in your body and even sugar and especially
combining like something like some soda some sugar with the protein that's a
deadly combination or even some pasta dish you are going to get tired because
the blood sugar effect so what you need to do is change your foods cut out the
refined sugars cut out the breads pasta cereal crackers viscous waffles pancakes
and just have like a salad with some protein not too much just enough just a
little bit maybe the deck of a card like three to six ounces and then what you
can do is consume a little bit of fat as well okay why because we had a little
fat we can actually allow us to go longer and without eating be more
satisfied so we keep insulin low okay now number two it could be that you're
not digesting your food so the food just kind of sits there and you'll feel
bloated in that case we need to acidify your stomach a lot of times that'll just
kind of perk you right up so you can either do apple cider vinegar in water
and drink that with the meal or you can do it in pills apple cider vinegar
Plus that has a couple other things in there take that before you you eat and
boom the food digests and you won't get tired anymore okay so it could be those
combinations so how do you know what you need well if you cut out the sugar and
eat healthy and you're still tired then we know you can't digest so then we have
to add these acidifiers okay plus if the food sits there it doesn't digest
you feel bloated that means we need to actually support the digestion not
necessarily the blood sugars okay so hope that helped
go ahead and apply that put your comments below your success stories

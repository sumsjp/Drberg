so today we're gonna talk about pseudogout knee pain and vitamin K2
so if you have knee pain this video is for you there's a possibility that your
knee pain could be a pseudogout situation and what is that well most
people may have heard about gout being a buildup of uric acid which it's true
specifically it's a monosodium urate crystals occurring because the kidney is
not able to get rid of the uric acid and uric acid can build up and it can create
a lot of problems in your body kidney stones as well as gout which is a very
severe painful inflammatory process of your big toe it can happen in other
joints as well if you have that I would highly recommend that you alkalis your
urine by taking potassium citrate you want to avoid foods that turn into uric
acid like foods that are high in purine like cut down on the beer no more than a
six-pack a night all right organ meats you want to cut that out
veal turkey sardines and definitely fructose as in high fructose corn syrup
these things will aggravate and gout now if you're on keto and you're doing
fasting sometimes you may have higher amounts of uric acid and what you need
to do basically is just take potassium citrate to help make your urine a little
less acidic and that should actually give you a lot of relief now with su
gout it's a different situation it's not uric acid it's calcium pyrophosphate
crystals okay so it's a calcium type buildup in the cartilage between the
joints so it can be very very painful and then me this type of calcium is
insoluble so it's not dissolving through your body it's just building up as
either a little spur it's the same calcium that's in toothpaste and
pseudogout mainly targets the knee and the wrists so the best remedy for
pseudogout and knee pain in general is vitamin k2 this is a fat soluble vitamin
it's different than k1 you want to take 200 micrograms
of k2 now k2 is a vitamin that is deficient if you're in a low-fat diet
because it comes from food high in fat definitely beef liver has it egg yolks
cheese has it so when someone actually starts cutting down their fat they
become very deficient in k2 but vitamin k2 takes the calcium from the soft
tissues and puts it into the bone it removes calcium from places in your body
that it shouldn't be like in the arteries around the heart and then the
kidney and it puts it back into the bone and as a side note k2 works with vitamin
d3 so you want to take d3 with k2 and the benefit of taking d3 is that vitamin
d3 is an anti-inflammatory so if you have knee pain you're going to reduce
the pain in the knee and remove the calcium deposits which is building up as
a spurring situation so if you're going to take 200 micrograms of k2 I would
take 20,000 I use of d3 now if it's really bad you can take even more than
this take 400 micrograms of k2 and 40,000 I use of d3 and you'll start
seeing some good benefits so anyway I wanted to give you just a good tip on
knee pain especially if you have pseudogout and even if you don't have
pseudogout you may find some great benefits simply because as the cartilage
wears in the knee and you start getting calcium deposits you have more
inflammation and k2 and d3 will work wonders for knee pain all right go ahead

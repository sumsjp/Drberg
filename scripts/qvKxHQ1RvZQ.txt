hey guys welcome back and today we're going to talk about coffee how much is too much it's a
question that keeps coming up so let's just define what a moderate amount of coffee would be that's
two to three eight ounce glasses per day or cups per day right a high amount is four cups or more
now going through college i was an extreme coffee drinker i'm talking i would drink pots of coffee
not just mild coffee but Cuban coffee thus all the health problems the adrenal burnout
ulcers etc that occurred after that so what i want to discuss today is what happens when you drink
too much coffee right now i drink a very small amount of coffee per day it's in the morning it's
a very small cup it's probably i don't know four to five ounces just because if i do too much it
does affect my sleep the biggest negative effect that coffee has on your body is the depletion of
potassium in fact they use serum potassium levels that's potassium levels in your blood
as a biomarker for acute caffeine poisoning so let's just talk about what happens when
you expose yourself to too much caffeine so we're not just talking about coffee it could be in sodas
it could be in sports drinks it can also be and all the other things that contain caffeine like
tea chocolate so the first thing that large amounts of caffeine will do to your body
is it will increase your release of catecholamines now what is catecholamines catecholamines are all
those things on the inside of the adrenal gland like adrenaline would be a catecholamine you have
dopamine gaba noradrenaline but for this video we're just primarily talking about adrenaline
so when you drink coffee you're stimulating adrenaline and when you increase adrenaline
you lose potassium okay so that's number one number two you increase the sodium potassium pump
now i've done other videos on this now inside your body you have all these little tiny cells
and in the cells you have billions of these little pumps that are generating electrical current and
that has a lot to do with running your nervous system and your muscular contraction and your
relaxation and you need a lot of potassium for that you also need this pump for energy so when
you start increasing the work on these pumps you need a lot of potassium and you get this shift
from the potassium inside the blood going out of the blood inside your cells so you're going to end
up with low potassium in your blood that's called hypokalemia so that's another mechanism of why you
lose potassium you'll also increase something called diuresis basically you're losing fluid
caffeine connect is a diuretic another way to lose potassium you also trigger something else called
respiratory alkalosis so your body starts becoming more excessively alkaline and when you have that
you lose potassium now if you're adding sugar to your coffee you're going to add another layer or
a complexity because you're going to spike insulin and as you may know in other videos when you spike
insulin you need potassium because you're going to be storing this glucose into the liver into
the muscles as glycogen and you need potassium to store that so you're basically going to deplete
your potassium even more and this also occurs if you're doing artificial sweeteners and i haven't
even talked about all the things that occur when you're low on potassium like heart arrhythmias
fatigue etc in this video i just wanted to point out and emphasize the biggest problem with too
much caffeine is a loss of potassium so if you're drinking a little bit too much coffee make sure
you add more potassium to the diet but ideally the best thing to do is just to consume a small
amount of coffee each day thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a
product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able
to answer everyone's call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

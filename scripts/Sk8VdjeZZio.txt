let's talk about histamine intolerance what is that well first of all
histamine is involved in the immune system it's also present in certain
foods and if you had damage to your stomach or your intestines you could be
deficient in this enzyme diamine oxidase and this is the enzyme that helps you
break down histamines and because histamines are in certain foods when you
eat certain foods these are the symptoms and you can experience headaches
migraines your sinuses get stuffy diarrhea asthma palpitations
of the heart skin gets flushed and red hives itchiness vertigo you're dizzy
when you stand up or low blood pressure these foods over here are high in
histamines pretty much all the fermented foods wines vinegar
however apple cider vinegar is less than the balsamic vinegar and other types of
vinegar aged cheese's cured meats alcohol avocados no no this is a keto
friendly food but it has higher amounts of histamines canned foods chocolate
black tea eggs mustard nuts soy spinach strawberries and tomato and there's
others as well but this list will give you an idea of the most common foods
that are high in histamines so two questions number one how do you know if
you have histamine intolerance and number two what do you do about it well
just start eating some of these foods and see if you get any of these
reactions okay that will pretty much tell you if you have a histamine
intolerance alright so now let's talk about what to do number one you want to
replace some of these foods with foods that are low in histamines okay I gave
you a list right here asparagus bell pepper blueberries cabbage cauliflower
grass-fed beef green leafy vegetables excluding spinach
turkey white fish green tea liver squash and zucchini if you eat these foods
you're gonna feel a lot better these symptoms should go away if you're truly
deficient in this enzyme so that's number one number two you want to
consume a supplement or something that has this enzyme in it and it just so
happens that grass-fed kidney has that enzyme so if you were to buy a product
and I'm not gonna give you any brands you can research that if you were to buy
a product that has a grass-fed kidney extract that will give you the enzyme
and you're going to feel a lot better when you consume some of these foods now
another product that has that enzyme is liverwurst you can get that from us
wellness meats it's grass-fed very high quality I'll put a link down below I
don't get any kickbacks from that just FYI alright the next thing that you want
to do is periodic prolonged fasting like every two weeks you fast for 48 hours in
addition to intermittent fasting why because you want to heal the gut so you
don't have a problem with this anymore and so your body can make this enzyme
fasting is the best way to basically grow a new gut lining including
supporting your stomach as well and lastly you want to do number 5 fix the
digestion yes you want to do the fasting but there's other things you can do to
support digestion as well supplements a probiotic I'm gonna put a video down
below so you can do some more research on the digestion alright guys so that's

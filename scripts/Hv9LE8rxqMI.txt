i've talked extensively on sugar causing
weight gain
and destroying the kidneys the heart
the eyes
the nervous system
but i haven't really emphasized
the magnitude of what sugar can do to
your brain especially the cognitive
connection to the brain and when i mean
cognitive i'm talking about your ability
to put attention on something
to focus in and concentrate
see when you put your attention on
something
for a period of time
you're actually ignoring a lot of extra
data and distractions that are around
you you have to zone in on one thing and
that requires a good amount of cognitive
power in fact your ability to hold your
attention on something and get something
done is really your personal power
and when you lose that and you're so
distracted they call that
attention deficit disorder right they
kind of made up and labeled this
condition
which
they say is a dopamine deficiency but
there's no proof that's just a theory
they also say that there's no cure uh
there's just therapy
and there's just medication i would love
to
find one person who's ever been cured
with
therapy for add and i'd like to also
find one person that's ever been cured
using medications and i'm talking about
actually coming off the medication
talking about ritalin correcting the
problem it doesn't because they
definitely don't talk about a cure they
say there's no cure but there's just
management that you're managing these
symptoms now when we talk about the
influence of sugar on the parts of the
brain especially the frontal lobe and
the hippocampus
which is involved in memory learning and
things like that we do know that there's
a very temporary spike in dopamine okay
which is your pleasure center it affects
your mood your behavior it makes you
feel better right makes you feel happier
at least for a minute right until
the receptors
for dopamine start downgrading okay so
now it takes more and more sugar to
create the same effect
but here's the big problem with sugar on
the brain it alters the inhibitory parts
of the brain
so now
we have less control over our own brains
we have less control over filtering this
extra data that's coming in on us 24 7
and we cannot put our attention on
anything for a period of time so we lose
focus there's actually atrophy of the
brain going on over a period of time
there's specifically the frontal lobe as
well as the hippocampus and it ages the
brain so it makes your brain older and
it reduces blood flow to the brain and
what's really just bizarre to me is that
when you look up attention deficit
disorder they talk about hereditary
would they talk about environmental
factors but they don't
ever even mention the word
sugar as a direct association or a cause
and let me just first talk about the
symptoms of how they describe add okay
not able to pay attention to detail
errors due to negligence okay
difficulty in focusing attention problem
with listening problem with finishing
tasks
problem organizing i mean
what if they just never been taught on
how to organize something right i mean
it's not something that always comes
naturally to people next one is avoiding
activities that require sustained
attention problem in placing objects
back where they belong i think that's
probably just genetic because i have a
hard time putting things back to where
they should be gets distracted easily
and forgetting tasks
i think this describes the entire
population right
and then how did they come up with this
diagnosis well they actually got
together in a room and they
voted on this say there's no objective
test there's no blood test there's no
anything it's all subjected now since
we're on the topic let me just throw in
one little thing on attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder right this is
like
wow
increased mobility of limbs the child
playing with his hands and feet
inability to stay seated for a long
period of time i mean
who can who can sit down for a long
period of time i don't know i think
that's everyone has that issue all right
three running and climbing successfully
even in situations when this is not
appropriate
i mean
isn't this normal for a child
number four difficulty playing quietly
so in other words what you're saying is
when you're playing you have to be quiet
that's normal i think that's
there's a problem with that all right
and last one is speaking excessively
that's a problem i think it's a problem
not speaking too much like you have
someone too quiet
versus someone that just likes to talk
wow incredible so this is how they
diagnose it but then the treatment is
ritalin right ritalin apparently is
supposed to increase your dopamine but
it has some slight minor
side effects which i want to read right
here tachycardia high blood pressure
headache insomnia anxiety
weight loss dry mouth abdominal pain
heart problems psychosis and death okay
and then also withdrawal symptoms
depression
dissatisfaction with life
exhaustion
nightmares and suicide
thoughts and even the world health
organization which i'm surprised they
even say this but says the evidence of
benefit versus harm is unclear i mean to
me it looks like there's a lot of harm
going on when people get on ritalin and
trying to come off of it of course if we
want to learn more about this sugar we
want to go to the experts the sugar
association okay i think it's
sugarassociation.org
what they say is as long as you practice
moderation and portion control you can
have your cake and eat it too right but
what really gets me is there's two
things that they say that are completely
lives okay number one is they say
carbohydrates are the number one source
of energy in the body that's absolutely
not true right you can run your body in
ketones actually way more efficiently
so positively not true if you run your
whole body and trigger for a period of
time you're gonna have a lot of health
problems and the second thing uh they
say is sugar is essential for the brain
okay
no it's not essential for the brain if
you stop eating sugar your body will
start making ketones there are certain
parts of your brain that need sugar but
that can come from your body's ability
to make sugar this is why our livers
can do what's called
gluconeogenesis okay this is a normal
thing if our body needs a little bit of
sugar it can make it we don't need to
have sugar so this is false information
all right so what is the solution stop
sugar
if you have kids that have a problem
with attention death disorder i'm not
telling you get them off the medication
but i'm just saying
if you stop the sugar you're going to
find that they're going to start
controlling their behavior a lot better
and the easiest way to come off sugar is
to replace it with an alternative sugar
i would recommend
sugar alcohols like xylitol erythritol
monk fruit stevia i will put a link down
below of all sorts of recipes and
honestly it's basically the same
sensation of sweet just without
being
sugar and then that way it makes it
easier but to be able to get rid of the
cravings for sugar you have to stop
sugar you can't just get rid of the
cravings without stopping sugar for a
period of time and i'm only talking
about one to two
maybe
three days okay and you got to bring
your carbs down below 20 grams per day
and that's going to really help your
appetite and reduce your cravings and i
think until you do that you're really
not going to know
that it's doable it's like wow your
cravings will go away within three days
and then it's going to be so much easier
okay
number two start taking b1
get a natural source or nutritional
yeast because b1
directly helps
the
nervous energy that both kids and adults
have it helps the brain focus as well
as replace the major deficiency that has
occurred because of all the sugar so
anytime you consume sugar
you also at the same time better be
taking a lot of b1 or else you go in the
negative and the symptom of b1 with the
brain is a lot of cognitive problems
memory loss inability to learn nervous
energy can't focus on anything restless
restless leg syndrome insomnia
and even nightmares believe it or not
okay and the third thing is to fix your
brain okay it's fasting and you'd fast
18 hours with a six hour eating window
you're gonna find if you do this for at
least a week your cognitive function is
gonna go way up a lot of you watching
i've already done this so please put
your comments down below so those people
who have not done this can see the
massive amazing successes that fasting
can do
for your focus
your concentration
and your attention on that note let me
put up a really good video on how to do
intermittent fasting it's right here
check it out

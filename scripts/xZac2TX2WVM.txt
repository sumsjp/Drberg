all right let's talk about how to read a cac score what is cac it stands for coronary artery
calcification score this is the amount of calcium and plaquing that is inside your arteries when
the inside of the blood vessel becomes irritated through oxidative stress or injury the body comes
in to repair it with calcium and the cholesterol and the more calcium you have in the arteries
the more you're at risk for getting a heart attack in fact 90 of men and 67 percent of women
over the age of 70 has some amount of calcium in their arteries and personally my opinion of
why this is because consuming high amounts of carbohydrate in your diet is like taking
steel wool and kind of sanding the inside of your arteries it creates a lot of irritation
a lot of inflammation so this scoring system goes from zero you can go over a thousand but ideally
you want this score to be zero and that will tell you there's no plaquing in the arteries
and the possibility of getting heart disease is very very low in fact this test the cac test is
one of the best predictors of mortality from all types of death it just tells you what's
going on internally but it's way better than a cholesterol test and it's not that expensive
i got the test and thank goodness it was zero all right now if the score is between one and ten the
plaque is very minimal and there's a low chance of getting a heart attack if the score is between
11 and 100 there's mild atherosclerosis and your probability of getting a heart attack is minimal
but it tells you something is brewing in the oven okay so if your score is between 101 and
400 there's a moderate amount of atherosclerosis and you have a moderate risk or a probability of
getting a heart attack now if you're over 400 okay we have extensive atherosclerosis
and you have a high chance of getting a heart attack so i would recommend getting this test
find out where you are and realize if it's high you can do something about it okay and then go get
retested maybe three months later but here's what you need to do you need to go low carb you need to
do intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting i would highly recommend taking niacin
the type of niacin that gives you that flushing that is going to increase your hdl which is kind
of like the vacuum cleaner it tends to take any excess cholesterol and pull it out of the body
and then the next one i would recommend is tocotrinols because that is going to protect
the inside of the arteries against free radicals it's 50 times stronger than the tocopherols
tocotrienols it's a type of vitamin e so that actually will help you reduce inflammation all
right and then i would take vitamin k2 vitamin k2 helps to mobilize calcium out of the arteries and
keeps it in the bone and lastly i would take a key later it's called edta that can help remove some
of the calcium inside the arteries all right that's the plan and thanks for watching so if

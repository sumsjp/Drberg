um yeah I after my son was born I just
couldn't sleep because I think it was
just just being on alert all the time
just was he crying so I didn't do
anything sometimes I would take a minute
in row to get to
sleep but you can't do that when you
have a baby so and then there's other
times that I would maybe have a glass of
wine because that would that would put
me out so after I took the adrenal
fatigue formula I was actually able to
sleep and it was a solid sleep a solid
seven to eight hours of sleep because I
was only getting about four to five
hours a day so now it's like it's just a
whole different world now like I'm
actually awake and alert ready to go the
next
day

I'm gonna talk about how to speed up your digestion this video is not just
for people that have constipation it's for people that have indigestion gas
bloating stomach pain anything that could be an incomplete cycle of
digestion so what we want to do is we want to actually break down each part of
your digestive tract and just talk about it so let's start with the stomach okay
acid is the key thing in your stomach that helps break down the protein it
also helps you absorb certain minerals and it kills off pathogens many people
do not have enough acid in your stomach many people have acid in our stomach but
it's not very very strong it's a weak acid so the pH needs to be between 1 and
3 that's like battery acid if the asset is really nice and strong and you have
enough then the valve on the top of the stomach closes you can eat food and it
just breaks down pretty fast adding more hydrochloric acid would be a good thing
now you're not gonna actually drink hydrochloric acid because that's gonna
completely burn your mouth your esophagus all the way down so you want
to take a weaker acid that will then build up your hydrochloric acid and
that's called betaine hydrochloride you can get this in a supplement ok now
other things you can do is you can add the materials that help you build up
hydrochloric acid so salt is sodium chloride so the chlorides from salt can
actually help build up hydrochloric acid also taking more potassium because you
need potassium to build stomach acid there's other nutrients you need as well
but these are the two most important ones
one would be taking apple cider vinegar you dilute it one tablespoon in a glass
of water or kombucha tea if you're doing kombucha tea make sure that you get the
the bottle that has the least amount of sugars ideally like two grams per bottle
would be perfect okay and also you're not going to drink the
whole bottle because it's like it's pretty big and it's a lot of acid to
drink in once but both of these would help acidify
your stomach the thing that counters and makes this worse are antacids and
calcium carbonate would make it worse and then we go to bile bile is made by
your liver it's stored in the gallbladder and it helps you break down
fats now you can actually take purified bile salts you want to take one after
the meal and that will help you with bloating burping belching and it will
help in the breakdown of fats in general if you wanted to increase your body's
ability to make bile you can also take a probiotic since microbes help you
recycle the bile but you can also consume beet tops so that will help your
liver make more bile also ginger artichokes lemon milk thistle and
choline all of these help the liver stimulate the production or more bile
salts now the things that will reduce your bile would be decreasing your
probiotics that's your friendly bacteria because you took an antibiotic taking
out the gallbladder or having a fatty liver or having some damage to your
liver in general that will reduce the production of bile you can also have a
problem with the drainage the bile ducts you can also have a sluggish gall
bladder there's a lot of things that can go wrong with that I'll put some links
down below more about the gall bladder but taking more purified bile salts or
things that will increase the bile production would actually help in that
section of digestion then you have the enzymes a lot of enzymes are produced by
your pancreas it's right underneath the left ribcage your small intestine
actually has the ability to make certain enzymes your stomach actually makes a
few enzymes the microbes in your intestine both small and large also make
enzymes but enzymes help you break down specific things like carbohydrates
proteins fats the more that you eat raw foods the more help you get with enzymes
why because heat destroys the enzymes food so if you're consuming mostly cook
food or canned food or pasteurized food you're gonna deplete your enzymes and
the more enzymes you might need to take you actually can take a blend of quite a
few different enzymes as a nutritional assistance when you eat certain foods
but the point is that if you have enough enzymes you actually can digest a lot if
you don't then you actually get all sorts of symptoms from indigestion
you can get a dark tarry stool like a kind of a black stool that's sticks in
the toilet seat because you're not breaking down the fats there's an enzyme
called lipase that works together with the bile to really take fat and break it
down into the smallest particles now let's talk about flora Flora's your
friendly bacteria it's the microbiome most the flora in your body is in the
large intestine you have a small amounts on the outside of the body actually in
every crevice of your body as well as even in the small intestine so taking a
probiotic is a very smart thing to do because that will build up your flora
now if you had an antibiotic or you consume a lot of GMO food you're gonna
lose your friendly bacteria and then you're gonna get things like
constipation you won't be able to make certain vitamins you have nutritional
deficiencies there's a whole list of things that happen when you lose the
flora so you need probiotics and then you also need the food that feeds these
microbes and that's called a prebiotic or a fiber and I recommend getting your
fiber from these things called vegetables then we have something over
here called the para sympathetic nervous system
now this opposes the sympathetic nervous system which is the flight or fight
mechanism so with that's like more stress this is rest and digest what
stimulates this system is keeping your stress low okay also taking be one from
nutritional yeast can actually stimulate this system and this system helps what's
called peristalsis the pumping action of your colon also taking more potassium
will help support this system as well is taking more magnesium and if you
want to see the entire digestion from A to Z a more comprehensive video I put it
right here check it out

today we're going to talk about seven
ways to boost your vitamin d levels
why
majority of the planet earth is low in
vitamin d and vitamin d is
so important not just in bone health but
for immune health cardiovascular
your blood sugars and the list goes on
and on and on in fact almost every
single cell in your body has receptors
for vitamin d
and the rdas the requirements for
vitamin d are way too low they're like
600 ius okay now that was based on
preventing bone loss but they didn't
take in consideration all the other
functions of vitamin d to protecting
against inflammatory conditions to
having an immune system and based on all
the research and what i'm going to talk
about
i recommend the average person get about
10 000
ius of vitamin d every single day as a
maintenance dosage especially
in winter now if you're getting a lot of
sun you definitely don't need that now
at first glance 10 000 iu seems like a
lot of vitamin d right
well we're talking about international
units and if we convert this to a
micrograms okay not grams not milligrams
but micrograms it's 250
micrograms okay that is only
0.25
milligrams that's one-fourth of one
milligram okay so that doesn't sound
like very much does it
now as far as the toxicity levels of
vitamin d
um
the studies based on that and i did a
separate video on this are based on
people taking
hundreds of thousands of ius for months
and the biggest side effect is
hypercalcemia which is too much calcium
in your blood
which could increase your risk for
kidney stones so if you have any
thoughts at all about you know toxicity
levels of vitamin d
just consume 2.5 liters of fluid every
single day
why because that will prevent kidney
stones okay
i mean that's really easy to do and also
just don't take calcium supplements in
any large amounts so you wouldn't want
to take the typical one a day with
the calcium carbonate okay if you did
these two things you would greatly
reduce your chance of the biggest side
effect from vitamin d if you're
concerned
now when i talk about 10 000 i use a
vitamin d i'm talking about a
maintenance dosage if you're trying to
use that for certain conditions
i would recommend going up to maybe 20
to 30 to 40 000 ius now the other thing
you need to know about vitamin d is
these requirements that you need
you just cannot get it from your diet
okay you just can't get it from your
foods there's just not enough vitamin d
in foods to get what you need so
you're really dependent on the sun
and the sun will give you all the
vitamin d you need if you're out there
long enough and if you expose your skin
to it because it is a certain wave
ultraviolet
rays
that interact with your skin that
convert the cholesterol
into
vitamin d so that being said let's just
talk about the other barriers
that people run into with absorption we
have body barriers we have your stomach
ph if you don't have a strong
acidic stomach you're not going to get
the vitamin d absorption if there's gut
inflammation that's going to be a big
big barrier
if there's any problem with your kidneys
let's say you're a diabetic and you have
kidney problems well the kidney and the
liver are two organs that help you
convert
vitamin d into its active form so kidney
problems equal low vitamin d and of
course if there's liver problems whether
you have a fatty liver hepatitis or
cirrhosis
that can inhibit your absorption of
vitamin d
not to mention this one right here if
your liver is damaged you're not going
to make the bile bile is absolutely
essential for
absorbing vitamin d
if you have insulin resistance like the
majority of the population you're not
going to absorb vitamin d and of course
that comes from
a high carb diet and of course if you're
a diabetic
you're greatly limited with your
absorption of vitamin d now more and
more people are getting their genetics
tested and there's a certain condition
it's called polymorphism where the
receptor for vitamin d
doesn't really absorb vitamin d too well
in which case you just need to take more
vitamin d so you can get that tested
just to see because i met this gal who
got a test and
here she was taking vitamin d the normal
amount of vitamin d and it wasn't even
working because the receptor wasn't
receiving because there was some genetic
defect
the more weight you have in your body
the less vitamin d you're going to get
and the more vitamin d you require if
you had gastric bypass surgery
your ability to absorb vitamin d is less
if you have low diversity in your
microbiome
you can't absorb vitamin d as much the
more stress you have
the less
absorption of vitamin d you're going to
have so you can see there's a lot of
barriers but there's even more
let's say you go on a low fat diet or a
low cholesterol diet
or
even worse you're on medications like
statins that's going to limit the raw
material that vitamin d is created from
now vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin
so when you take vitamin d
it might be a good idea to take it with
some oil or fat or a meal now another
barrier that people have is they for
some reason can't swallow vitamin d
capsules let's say they're a child or an
adult that just can't get the capsules
down now if you have this problem or you
have children that can't swallow
capsules i have a very good solution i
put that in the description
it not only has vitamin d3 but it also
has vitamin k2
zinc as well as mct oil for absorption
now the other barrier is skin color the
darker your skin
the more vitamin d you're going to need
and then we have age okay so your skin
gets thicker as you age and also you
absorb less vitamin d
and your location where you live is
important too it has to do with latitude
if you live in the northern part of the
planet not close to the equator
you're going to have a difficult time
getting enough sun to convert your
cholesterol into vitamin d and then of
course we have the seasons okay you have
the winter
even if you lay out in the sun in the
winter okay you're still not going to
get enough vitamin d simply because
where the sun is in relationship to
how much rays you're getting vitamin d
absorption is also dependent on your
magnesium level and your zinc level two
other things that can limit your
absorption and anytime you take vitamin
d3 you always want to take vitamin k2
because they work together vitamin k2
keeps the calcium out of the joints
and the arteries okay and the last
variable that is a big variable is just
being outside in the sun enough
more and more people are inside
especially children and so that is
really why we are deficient
okay so let's take a look at
how you can boost
your
vitamin d levels
get at least one hour in the sun every
single day okay of course not in the
winter but during the day and expose
your arms and your legs to the sun
directly that would be a good thing of
course expose your skin but not to the
point of being burned all right number
two take your vitamin d because it's fat
soluble with some fat some nct oil or
when you eat a meal
and also when you eat the meal to get
your magnesium and your zinc make sure
you consume food high in magnesium as in
big salads now of course with the zinc
you can get zinc from a trace mineral
supplement or you can get it from
shellfish or seafood as well number
three
go on keto and intermittent fasting so
you have more ability to convert into
the active form of b3 also you'll have
more bile to absorb vitamin d3
also you're going to decrease insulin
resistance and help your absorption
and you're going to lose weight which is
going to directly increase your ability
to absorb more vitamin d
not to mention you reduce your gut
inflammation from the fasting and absorb
more vitamin d so this is very very
important number four consume more fatty
fish on a regular basis
or cod liver oil the cool thing about
cod liver oil compared to like fish
supplements is that cod liver oil not
only has the omega-3 fatty acids but it
has vitamin a and vitamin d okay so it's
unique in that it's different than fish
oils okay fish oils don't have vitamin d
fatty fish does but not fish oils so
that's why i recommend the collard oil
number five if you take vitamin d in a
liquid form it tends to absorb better
especially if there's gut issues if
there's stomach issues
and there's intestinal issues and i will
put a link down below in the description
for a good brand number six if you have
a genetic factor related to
um the receptor for vitamin d the only
solution you have is just to take higher
quantities so you wouldn't take 10 000
ius you would probably take
30 000 ius as your maintenance dosage
and number seven increase more bile
generally speaking if you have more bile
you can absorb more vitamin d now how do
you do that well you can either take a
purified bile cell product or you can do
things to the liver to increase the bile
and on that note i think the best video
to watch next would be on how to
increase your bile salts i put it up
right here

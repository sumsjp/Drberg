so what country in the world consumes the most sugar united arab emirates that's right
now the data that i'm going to share with you is from the year 2017 i could not find
the current numbers maybe it's changed a little bit but check this out in 2017 the uae consumed 1
855 000 metric tons of sugar that is 1 billion 855 million kilograms of sugar now 1 000 metric tons
equals 1 million kilograms and the population is a little over 9 million people that equates to an
average citizen of a 195.6 kilograms per year of sugar that is a half a kilogram or a little more
than a pound of sugar every single day now if we compare that to the amount of sugar consumed
for a u.s citizen that's only 33.8 kilograms so as you can see the amount of sugar that's consumed in
the uae is literally off the chart so let's take a look at a day of what you would eat to reach
that amount let's say for example we consumed a chocolate bar or a part of it which is about
100 grams of chocolate giving you about 50 grams of sugar and then we added two cups of ice cream
100 grams of sugar and then one breakfast sandwich gave you 50 grams of sugar for lunch she had two
burgers another 100 grams of sugar and then for dinner we had two slices of pizza another 100
grams of sugar and then through the day you're drinking about one liter of coca-cola another
100 grams of sugar totaling 500 grams which is a half a kilogram or a little more than one
pound of sugar every single day and this explains why literally one third of their population is
severely overweight not to mention the massive amount of diabetes that is spreading around that

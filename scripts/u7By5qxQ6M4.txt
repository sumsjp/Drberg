i want to discuss why fasting can help lower your blood pressure high blood pressure or hypertension
usually has no symptoms you don't know what's going on unless you get your blood pressure tested
and if you're getting older it might be a good idea to have a blood pressure
cuff around just to assess this there's two types of hypertension you have primary and
you have secondary 95% of all hypertension cases are primary okay hypertension and that's related
to lifestyle and so if you look this up they're going to mention you know consuming too much salt
having obesity smoking drinking alcohol the recommendation is consuming a healthy diet
i love it but if you dig further into what they recommend as a healthy diet that's where you get
the problem because they're recommending fruits vegetables whole grains they have
to stick the whole grains in there less than 30% of your calories being fat and of course
they recommend avoiding the saturated fats of course and then they recommend less than
10 percent simple sugar so they're allowing up to 10% of all your calories being simple sugars
wow amazing well what does that come out to in teaspoons 12 teaspoons a day because it's 50 grams
of sugar that's what they're allowing okay that's considered part of a healthy diet
now before i see anything else i want to give a disclaimer i'm not recommending you coming
off your medication without the help of your doctor okay just giving you data to think with
so there was a study called the sprint trial study in 2015 where they tested people over 50
years old with high blood pressure and they found that they lived a little bit longer when they took
multiple medications for hypertension okay that sounds pretty good but here's the problem with
that they found significant risks with this benefit of living longer and that risk is a
significant increased risk in kidney disease okay and so if something can help you yet it comes with
this other thing that can hurt you it's not the ideal situation from my viewpoint now the other
interesting thing about this study is they they didn't use everyone that had high blood pressure
they only used a fraction of the people that had high blood pressure and their pool of people that
they were using the ones that were the most severe and so if you don't have a severe high blood
pressure problem then this data on it helping you live longer would be invalid because they didn't
test those people shifting gears there was another study on 174 individuals who did fasting and yes
it was medically supervised but there was a 90% success rate of lowering blood pressure into a
fairly good range when people did fasting but my question is why well this is why because fasting
is the most powerful way to lower insulin and when you have high insulin because you
have insulin resistance the arteries become very very stiff and so one of the root causes
of hypertension is a blood sugar problem coming and being caused by insulin resistance and high
levels of insulin but the high levels of insulin that should normally lower the blood sugars
is not working because of the insulin resistance the point is this if you have insulin resistance
you're at risk of getting hypertension and this is why people that have the metabolic syndrome
syndrome x one part of that is hypertension and the common thread with that condition is
high levels of insulin hyperinsulinemia okay that's the medical term but it's basically just
insulin resistance all right so what should you do if you have high blood pressure start fasting
immediately start doing intermittent fasting that right there might just totally handle it
and then you can get with your doctor and uh work together to wean off your medication all
right number two add vitamin d vitamin d is a very powerful uh natural remedy for high blood pressure
next point is potassium start taking more potassium if you're low in potassium your
arteries can get very stiff so potassium makes the arteries very very soft and flexible i put a link
down below with other benefits from potassium all right add vitamin k2 why because vitamin k2
helps remove excess calcium from the arteries okay so it's going to make the arteries more
pliable elastic because calcium tends to make them more rigid vitamin d and k2 work together
this is why one of the remedies for hypertension is calcium channel blockers why are they blocking
calcium because the calcium is making things very very stiff and vitamin k2 can help counter that
and then add magnesium ideally you should get your magnesium and potassium from leafy greens large
amounts of salad but you can also add magnesium to your diet like magnesium orotate is a really good
one and watch your blood pressure come down those are all the nutritional things that can help you
but if you add fasting and a low carb diet which will also help insulin resistance i think that
would be a really good plan to avoid high blood pressure and i just want to mention this point
when doing research on this topic it's just amazing how much data that is put out there
on the front page of google in fact it's not just on the first page on google it's uh it's on the
first five pages of google all the links it's just you get all this data all this information
what i try to communicate in the videos all the videos that i do is the important stuff not the
trivial stuff so when you're doing research in the area of health problems and many other things
you have to dig through all the fluff all the minutia all the trivial stuff to find the gold
and so i just want to let you know that i spent a lot of time in focusing on this one point is
just giving you the most important stuff and not the trivial all right thanks for watching
hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system

let's talk about copd chronic
obstructive
pulmonary disease what does this word
mean it means that there's a lung
disease
that takes a bit of time to develop
that's the word chronic obstructive
means you're not able to breathe to a
certain degree
another name for copd is emphysema
some of the symptoms there's quite a few
the most common ones are shortness of
breath
coughing mucus the problem with copd is
it's a progressive
condition that eventually leads to
pulmonary hypertension so you're getting
blood pressure that's going up in your
lungs
and it's going to put a lot of stress on
the right ventricle that's the right
part of your heart it's the pump that
pushes all your blood to the entire body
so as you stress the right part of that
pump
it's going to eventually weaken and
you'll start to get edema
you'll usually see that in your ankles
so if you see swelling in your ankles
then we know this is going on right here
now if we take a look at what's
happening inside your lungs
you have these little pouches called
alveoli they look like little clusters
of grapes
okay normally they look like this when
you have copd
they look like this so you lose the
shape of these little pouches
because there's a tremendous amount of
irritation
from either smoke or some other
substance that's creating a
constant inflammatory process this word
comes from the latin word which means
uh cavity because it's a little
pouch-like hole
now the purpose of the alveoli is just
to exchange
certain gases it's pulling in
co2 from the blood and it's adding into
the circulation
oxygen so we have this exchange between
oxygen and co2
so you have this very very thin lining
of the alveoli
that allows this diffusion to take place
and right outside
that thin layer you have these tiny
little
blood vessels called capillaries so
we're really
mixing in the oxygen with the blood
so it acts sort of like a carburetor the
carburetor
is the lung of your engine where you're
actually pulling in
oxygen mixing it with fuel with the
right ratio a little spark plug
and creating energy so the problem with
copd
is this chronic irritation creates
inflammation
in something called oxidation and
oxidation is basically it's like a
rusting out effect
of your your body tissue and the more
the body rusts out
it creates inflammation and it's going
to try to heal
incorrectly with too much scar tissue we
call that fibrosis
and so we get a thickening of this
membrane
and when the membrane becomes thicker
you slowly lose your ability to
exchange gases and get oxygen so you
have
more difficulty breathing so it's
basically shutting off the oxygen
to this carburetor right here now one of
the problem with this is that you're
also getting a buildup of co2
carbon dioxide and that's going to
affect your breathing because you're
breathing in
something that's mimicking additional
smoke it's just like
not oxygen it's just kind of like this
other thing that's going to
irritate your lungs greatly in summary
that's what copd is now what can you do
about it
there's some really interesting research
on this
and it has to do with this right here
oxidation
at the heart of copd you're getting a
massive amount of oxidation
there just happens to be an anti-oxidant
that can help stop this
maybe even reverse it some of the
studies were done in animals
not in humans yet but it makes sense
that it would work in humans as well
and it has to do with a type of vitamin
e
now most people might associate vitamin
e with
tocopherols but fairly recently there
was a
a type of vitamin e called tocotrinols
which
is really in nature part of the vitamin
e complex so you have
tocotrienols and you have tocopherols
the type of vitamin e that you would
need
to help reduce this oxidation would be
the tocotrienols
more than the tocopherols so you want to
get a supplement
that has a dosage of about 300
milligrams
okay of tocotrienols only tocotrinols
are
50 times stronger than the tocopherols
so it's going to really help you reduce
this oxidation
and other things that are very
destructive
in the lung tissue so your inflammation
is going to come way down
with tocotrienos and i would take 300
milligrams i would take that three times
a day
on an empty stomach so the goal with
tocotrienols
is to stop the oxidation inflammation so
it doesn't turn into
fibrosis but if you think about vitamin
e in general what do people
use it for they use it for scarring
right so
you're reducing scar on the skin well
why not just take it internally to
reduce scarring too
not just in your lungs but also in the
liver there's some great data on
cirrhosis
but you can also use it on copd to help
break down some of the scarring in the
lungs
next remedy is vitamin d3
i would venture to say that a hundred
percent of patients with copd
are severely deficient in vitamin d you
have a lot of receptors for vitamin d in
the lung
one of the treatments for copd is
steroids okay
like prednisone and other and other
types of steroids that are like
bronchosteroid inhalers because steroids
are anti-inflammatory
and vitamin d is the closest thing to
that steroid cortisol that we're talking
about it acts like this
anti-inflammatory
but without the side effects
it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory
but you have to take enough
so you want to take about 40 000
international units of
vitamin d3 every single day
okay that's going to reduce inflammation
and
help you breathe what intermittent
fasting will do is drop your
inflammation even more
the more frequent you eat the more
inflammation you're going to have in
your body
the goal is to minimize the damage
control
and extend your life so we want to
really attack
this right here as much as possible
because this is causing
this cause effect so fasting is going to
be necessary
periodic prolonged fasting so a fasting
of 72 hours let's say every so often
maybe every two weeks
would greatly help you why because it's
going to increase
stem cells stem cells are
cells that don't have a purpose yet
they're undifferentiated cells they're
kind of like basic
cells that can turn into tissue like any
different type of tissue
so when you do prolong fasting your body
will
use these stem cells to replace
the damaged tissue of your lungs and not
only that
it's going to stimulate something called
a tophagee
autophagy is like a recycling action of
your body
in autophagy recycles damaged
proteins fibrosis
is a protein it's a scarring it's going
to help recycle and break that down
and use that as energy and through its
recycling
brand new tissue so fastening will help
the lungs in various ways
dropping inflammation and actually
correcting some of this damage through
here as well
number four keto the way you do keto is
you drop your carbohydrates
and then your body starts to switch over
into ketones
from fat fuel ketones are very
anti-inflammatory
again another way to drop inflammation
vitamin c not synthetic but from actual
food or
food concentrate vitamin c is
another powerful anti-inflammatory
and there's some additional studies
which i'll put down below that shows
that will increase your oxygen
and decrease the co2 so this is very
important as well
osha root is a native american indian
remedy for lung disorders so this is
another
great thing to consider right here
all right what is the other problem with
copd usually people develop it from
smoking and sometimes
they are still smoking even though
they've been diagnosed with this
condition
so it's very very difficult for certain
people to give up smoking
100 because of its addictive qualities
and it's mainly from this chemical
called nicotine which i want to talk
about now
nicotine is interesting because
it stimulates a part of the nervous
system that relaxes you
it actually causes a stress reduction
through your whole body
and in fact it can help you breathe a
little bit better this is why
when people go out and smoke you can
just see them calm down they feel like
they can finally
breathe as they're breathing in all the
smoke the problem with nicotine it comes
with additional package
of the extra smoke that's creating this
right here
so ultimately the goal would be to
handle the addiction to that at the
cellular level
the receptors for nicotine have been
altered
to the point where they're downgraded
so a lot of the effects of feeling calm
stress relief are now dependent
on this thing right here so unless you
continually take in this nicotine
your stress level goes up you might get
slightly irritable you might get angry
you might have depression
it can really affect your uh your brain
nicotine also stimulates adrenaline
and adrenaline is interesting because
adrenaline constricts the arteries
except for two parts of your body
one is in the heart the main artery of
the heart is called the coronary
nicotine actually opens up and
vasodilates that artery so it increases
more blood flow to the heart
in the lungs it creates a vasodilation
effect it opens up the lung tissue so
you can breathe better
but everywhere else it constricts the
arteries so that's
a very unique thing about adrenaline
well nicotine increases adrenaline
the problem is it kind of burns out your
adrenals so eventually
it's harder and harder to create that
effect so you need sometimes you need
more and more nicotine to create that
same effect
to the point where you just don't have
enough adrenaline your body
to keep your lungs open so unless you're
taking nicotine
to try to kind of stimulate that
everything kind of shuts down
nicotine also stimulates two other
chemicals in your body that greatly
affect your mood
and your pleasure so sometimes if you
don't smoke
these don't really work in your body so
your stress level goes up with that as
well
the best way to handle any type of
withdrawal symptoms or any type of
addiction
is to replace it with something else
so there's a couple things that i would
recommend there's something called
mormon tea
now there used to be this herb called
mae hong that was
available that you could take for
various things
uh it was actually really good for the
lungs but
it created other complications so they
banned it from the market
but mormon tea has a kind of a
mild effect of stimulating adrenaline
so it can actually help open up the
lungs it's very mild
but this could potentially act to give
you some relief so the need for this can
go down
also if you take a look at the
withdrawal symptoms of nicotine
you have increased stress nervous
anxiety
and grouchiness or anger and things like
that
vitamin b1 counters that so if you start
taking
b1 through the day that will minimize
the side effects
the last thing to realize about nicotine
is that in order for the
receptors to bounce back and reset to go
back to normal
it could be between two to six weeks
okay
the very latest so realize that these
withdrawal symptoms are only temporary
and if you can just stick it out for two
to six weeks it's going to be a lot
easier to completely handle
this addiction right here all right in
summary i put all these things to do
in the description down below check them
out and thanks for watching
before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto
and you want to know how to begin keto
or you're on keto
and you need a debug because it's not
going as smooth
i have a keto consultant standing by to
help you
this is just for the people in the us
hopefully in the future we'll be able to
answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you
can call
and get some help

so let's talk about the importance of zinc in your immune system zinc is
probably one of the most important trace minerals because it does so many things
but one of the most important things it has the capacity to help is supporting
your immune system it's involved in genes DNA synthesis making DNA it's
involved in many different enzymes it's involved in protein synthesis wound
healing heart health joint health insulin thymus function and your gonads
if you're low in zinc you're not going to make enough testosterone so let's
take a look at what occurs if you become deficient in zinc related to your immune
system first thing is that your thymus gland starts to shrink okay
it's called thymic atrophy well you need the thymus gland to make t-cells it's a
training camp for white blood cells also your lymphocytes go down this is part of
your army that fights infection next one defective white blood cell responds so
your immune system doesn't respond correctly anymore also you get a
decreased recovery rate of the infection so it takes you longer to heal there's
an increased duration of the infection there's also increased inflammatory
response there's increased oxidative stress which creates a lot of collateral
damage and then you have a general decrease capacity to fight off
infections and you're susceptible to viruses and bacteria other than that
you're good to go now the question is how do you get it well there's certain
foods that are very high in zinc oysters are at the top of the list and also
other shellfish red meat is a good source of zinc and other trace minerals
seafood fish in pumpkin seeds if you wanted to get it as a supplement I
recommend getting the zinc bisglycinate chelate why because this is much more
bioavailable than other sources it has a 230 percent better absorption rate than
zinc sulfate and a 390 percent better absorption rate
then zinc oxide there are certain things in your foods that can prevent the
absorption of zinc one are phytates now where do you get phytates that's in
all the cereals it's in the whole grains it's in the brand so if you're consuming
cereal on a regular basis or you're doing breads and pasta and certain
crackers things like that you potentially could be deficient in zinc
also oxalates can deplete your zinc and that would be in spinach almonds
chocolate Kiwi rhubarb antacids and acids will also lower the absorption of
zinc and they really have to do with your stomach acid you need a lot of
strong stomach acid to pull in the zinc so antacids pull the stomach acid out
leaving you deficient in stomach acid and now you can absorb zinc also
malabsorption if you're some type of pre-existing gut damage or inflammation
your gut because of whatever maybe you took antibiotics when you're younger
that could prevent the absorption of zinc also gastric bypass could be
another situation so if you have any of those conditions you need to take more
zinc especially if your immune system is weakened and you're more susceptible if
you haven't seen my comprehensive video on boosting your immune system I put it

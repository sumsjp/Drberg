all right so i had another question that came up that i want to talk about
headaches on keto i didn't have headaches before started keto now i have headaches all the time
there's a nerve called the phrenic nerve they basically go underneath the diaphragm on the left
side the right side and the right side of one is very close to the gallbladder so if there's
any type of congestion with your gallbladder or bloating it's going to put pressure on that nerve
and that nerve goes up all the way to the right side through here and up to this area
right through and here so if you have any type of headache on the right side of your head or neck
that is related to the gallbladder now the thing about keto is you're going to do more
fats now when you do more fats your body has to adapt to digesting them i'm talking about
having enough bile so your capacity for bile might be a little bit low
so you need to maybe go into this a little bit more gradually because if you don't have enough
bile and you add more fat especially extra fat like the mct oil and butter and things like that
keto bombs which is a little fat treats you're going to overwhelm the gallbladder
and you're going to get bloating you're going to get congestion so real simple solution cut down
the fats and or take some purified bile salts and that will help you digest these fats but
if there's pressure in the gallbladder it goes right up to the right side and that can cause
headaches next thing is oxalates unfortunately the common keto foods like spinach
almonds almond flour and also chocolate if you're doing keto friendly chocolate
all of those are loaded with oxalates and that can be very irritating to the kidney
and also your joints and even your bile ducts so it can cause pain arthritis or even headaches
so that's another thing to look at if you're doing a lot of spinach or almond flour just
cut those out and see if your headaches go away number three nuts when people do keto
they really dive into those nuts and they have a lot of nuts a lot of peanut butter
these are all very high in omega-6 fatty acids which are very very stressful to the liver
and the bile ducts so that's another thing you might want to watch out for sugar alcohols like
xylitol erythritol these are things that should be taken in small amounts if you have too many of
these it can really mess with your digestion and create bloating and and that digestive congestion
then refers pain up to your head so a lot of headache issues really come from digestion
last thing is dirty keto which is a version of keto that doesn't focus on the quality of your
foods so if you're doing dirty keto and you're not hardly doing any vegetables you're doing
other types of things that could irritate your digestive system
and you don't have very many vegetables to help offset that and help keep the liver in good shape
then that can cause headaches as well especially if you're going to a fast food restaurant
and you're getting all the chemicals that are associated with these foods even though
it's keto it may not be the healthiest version of keto all right guys there you have it the
five underlying reasons why you may have headaches on keto before you go if you have a question about
a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto

hey it's me again in this video we're going to talk about flabby skin whether
it's in the back of your arms and underneath your chin or your legs your butt
or your hips let's cover what's underneath that now in the past video
I've talked about cortisol which is an adrenal hormone being the root cause of
loose skin and if you're on but there's another very common cause and that has
to do with this one hormone called insulin okay but it's really a condition
of insulin resistance but let me just explain what that means insulin
resistance is a condition where you have a ton of insulin but it's not working
okay because your body is resisting at the cellular level all right now you
need insulin you definitely you cannot live without it but the problem
is we have too much of it because there are diets like sugars and things like
that but check this out your cells have a
little window that allows insulin to drive fuel in the cells but also insulin
is one of the main hormones that drives amino acid into the cells it's the
hormone that allows the absorption of proteins specifically branched amino
acids now what does branched amino acids now you see this a lot of times and
people that are exercising weightlifters because branched amino acids are
specifically good to repair and replenish lost muscle okay so if you're
losing muscle you atrophying you would want branch amino acids but the problem
is the insulin is not working to pull those amino acids into the cell be cute
because you could have insulin resistance right but what caused this
problem in the first is you had you had too much insulin and then now of a
sudden your body is rejecting it and so now you're stuck with you can't absorb
insulin yet you have too much okay it's kind of a weird situation so in an
insulin resistant cell you really are kind of like your cells are starving for
protein amino acids and fuel so so here's some symptoms with to know that
you have this number one you can't lose weight number two you have a bell
at number three a brain fog fatigue if you skip a meal you get very irritable
you can't go a long time without eating when you're eating you're not satisfied
when you're eating you get tired right after you're eating these are just
common symptoms it's kind of a pre-diabetic State so what happens is
you get this signal sent back to the pancreas that makes insulin and telling
the pancreas hey we don't have an event Celyn here so go ahead and pump out more
more insulin because it's being blocked so now the pancreas thinks that doesn't
have enough so it's driving more and more insulin to force the nutrition into
the cell so you end up with a real bad situation because all that excess
insulin creates other issues so here we end up with a body that doesn't have
amino acids and you get flabby skin and aging and all sorts of issues with
diabetes yet on the other side all this excess insulin is creating belly fat but
also a lot of cognitive problems it will create something called an amyloid or
amyloid fibril with what does that mean it's amyloids are sticky protein
structures in the brain that are nearly always found in Alzheimer's Parkinson's
dementia even it's kind of like a diabetes type 3 it's also found in
strokes I'm going to put some links down there so here's my thought obviously you
want to increase your longevity of your memory your brain you don't want to get
Alzheimer's well you want to fix this insulin resistant problem because
amyloids come from high levels of insulin and that gets stuck in the brain
and last thing you want to do is end up with a stroke so they talk about clogged
arteries right well but they don't talk about amyloids being clogging the
arteries to talk about cholesterol well amyloid is a protein well so is so
is the cholesterol - it's a high-density lipoprotein but that's a whole other
lecture but the point is that you may find that you're getting brain fog and
memory problems and you know going into the whole Alzheimer's thing realize that
you want to fix this situation so that way the brain
can start absorbing the fuel it needs and the protein it means your your
muscles can come back the skin can start becoming tone so let's just talk about
what that means as far as what you have to do in your diet number one obviously
you have to get the sugars out okay and you may already know that refined sugars
breads pasta cereal crackers things like that secondly you need to get the
alcohol out of your system out of your diet completely right now because that's
going to create a problem next one never ever ever ever combine
protein with sugar okay because that could be even like like the breads with
the bun and the pastries and all that stuff when you add sugar to protein you
dramatically exaggerate the insulin I mean like goes way up in fact if you
should add sugar to anything it's actually even worse you better off
eating sugar alone then you would combining it so we don't want to add the
sugar even if you add sugar and fat you accentuate insulin so we don't want to
do that okay snacking will also create this problem so you don't want to snack
between meals eating fat with the meal is not going to be a problem because it
allows you to go longer so fat is not the cause of insulin resistance despite
what some people might tell you sometimes they'll be do experiments on
rats using corn oil or stone soy oil so it's it's very very cloudy as far as the
research on that but I found that you can easily do fats and if you're
concerned just stick with coconut oil peanuts and things like that but we want
that fat with the meal so you can go longer without eating so you want two to
three meals a day okay so that's a really important thing you want the
greens in there you want to avoid the foods that trigger insulin
okay that's excessive protein combining protein with sugar sugar itself and
snacking those are the culprits right there a couple of things let's say you
drink coffee right and you drink a lot of coffee all that caffeine is going to
trigger more insulin as well so if you're going to drink coffee
keep it a very small amount only in the morning and then that's it for the day
okay so so getting your skin back is not about eating more protein it's about
finding out what's underneath it is it a stress State is it cortisol is it that
you have no activity like you're not exercising I mean that could be a
situation because you need to work the body or is that this insulin resistance
thing which is actually very very common okay so I just want to enlighten you on
this definitely put your comments below and I have a link down there of a quiz that you
can take too so if you have a situation and you want to find out what's
underneath it fill out the quiz and actually we'll send you a report that kind of tells
us what's wrong with your body as far as the root cause okay thanks for watching
I'll see you the next video

let's talk about how important breastfeeding is and the benefits of
breastfeeding now the future health of your child
is really dependent on the mother's nutrition
and the quality of that breast milk and yes there is some concerns about mothers
not being able to produce enough milk if you're consuming enough nutrition and
you're on the right eating plan you should
be able to produce enough but normally if you're producing enough breast milk
the child will gain weight about 500 to 1000 grams per month
and will be passing urine about six to eight times per day
but let's talk about the benefits increasing lifespan
of infants because you're decreasing sudden into death syndrome
that's a big one right there number two colostrum
the first part of the milk when a mother starts to breastfeed
is a certain percentage of colostrum colostrum is
an incredible immune creating uh substance it has antibodies it has
immune factors all sorts of amazing things to protect
that child and if you're not breastfeeding
they're not going to get this right here so
there's going to be some effect on the future immune system in the strength
of the immune system number three decrease
risk of gi infection number four decreased risk of allergies
number five non-breastfed infants are 14 times more likely
to die of diarrhea now this is worldwide okay so it's not just in america number
six non-breastfed infants are three times more likely to
die of respiratory infection and number seven non-breastfed infants
are two times more likely to die from infections in general now even though
this is a short list of benefits this should be enough to convince you that
breastfeeding is the way to go but the best time to prepare a mother
for birth is a couple years before she gets pregnant
and what a mother consumes during the pregnancy
and as she's breastfeeding is vitally important

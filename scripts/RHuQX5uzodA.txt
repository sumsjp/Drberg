are you finding that when you're cutting your carbs you're still not able to lose weight and
a lot of videos if you hit a plateau i tell you to cut your carbs down right i also will tell you to
eat less frequently do more fasting both of these should work but if they don't there's usually two
reasons for this one is there's a problem with your sleep and another one is that there's a
problem with this right here too much stress and so i'm going to talk about the relationship
between the sleep hormone melatonin as well as the stress hormone cortisol in relationship to
why you're not losing weight so sleep produces a hormone called melatonin melatonin comes in when
it gets dark out and it helps induce a deep wonderful restful sleep right
and that's when all the magic happens with weight loss because you're going to spike
growth hormone and you're going to wake up with less weight but melatonin it inhibits insulin i
don't know if you know this but insulin is the key hormone that blocks your ability to lose weight
okay so if you take a look at melatonin inhibiting insulin that would be a good thing right lowering
insulin the body is saying hey it's time to sleep we don't need to release insulin now right
so you can start losing weight but if you're exposed to a blue light about i don't know
two or three hours before you go into sleep and it's you're on your computer
or you're on your cell phone you're getting all this blue light that's going to block insulin okay
so insulin starts kicking in about two hours before you go to sleep and so we don't want
to mess with that so it's very very important not to be around that blue light before you go to bed
because what's going to happen that is going to block melatonin and now we're going to actually
have more insulin which is then going to affect your weight so that's one mechanism right there
but also late night snacking okay let's say for example you're a snacker it's light at night
and you eat something but guess what's going to happen this food especially if it's carbohydrate
is going to try to stimulate insulin but insulin is being suppressed to a certain
degree by melatonin so we're not going to have the help of insulin to regulate these blood sugars
so your blood sugars are going to go up okay and with more blood sugars being up you're not going
to lose weight so depending on the mechanism of what disrupts this melatonin either blue light
or eating that right there is going to inhibit your ability to lose weight all right so that's
one mechanism and i have a lot of videos on how to fix this and what to do about this
and how to get rid of the cravings so you can watch those down below but sleep is very very
very important if you're trying to lose weight let's talk about stress when you go through
stress you stimulate this hormone called cortisol another name for cortisol is a glucocorticoid
gluco standing for glucose right it's a glucose hormone it releases glucose as quick energy
for stress so if you're trying to go to sleep at night and you get this higher cortisol this quick
glucose release for quick energy because your body's in some stress mode that's going to affect
your ability to lose weight because now we have more sugar when you don't even eat sugar your body
is releasing the sugar because it's increasing gluconeogenesis in other words it's making its
own sugar from fat or protein so here you are you don't even need any carbs you're lowering your
carbs but the carbs are coming from a conversion of your fat into carbs made by your liver
caused by this darn hormone right here that's the mechanism for that also cortisol inhibits insulin
so it allows the blood sugars to go up so we don't get the benefit of that blood sugar regulation
when there's high levels of cortisol and that can also lead to more insulin resistance so
stress especially chronic stress lack of sleep are two very important factors to look at
if you're not losing weight but what i always like to do is first make sure the carbs are low make
sure you're doing fasting longer okay and you can always go to these two other factors right here
all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

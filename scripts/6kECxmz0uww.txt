hey guys dr. Berg here in this video we're going to talk about how to drop
one size in one week guaranteed okay there are five things
you need to focus on we're taking all the best strategies and putting them
together okay number one this is a technique it's a strategy using
intrument intermittent fasting why because every time you eat you raise
insulin insulin is the common denominator between whether you're going
to lose weight or not lose weight whether you're going to burn fat or not
burn fat so if there's insulin too high forget about losing weight so if we can
eat less meals okay we're not talking but less calories less meals less
infrequent this is going to really help you reduce insulin and help you lose
weight so I'm gonna recommend two meals okay you can spread them out equally
maybe a late morning and then for dinner okay so no snacking is in between
because we don't want to raise insulin when you eat protein 3 to 6 ounces not
too much just enough a large amount of vegetables because we need that because
as we get into fat-burning you need to flush all that fat out of your system
and not do necessary like a high protein diet we're doing a a moderate amount of
protein a little bit smaller amount we're actually doing a lot of vegetables
okay and we're gonna add some fat it's almost impossible to do this without
adding some fat why because fat is one of the only foods that will not raise
insulin too much and so if we can actually do fat it's gonna allow you to
go longer even though there's more calories we don't care about that we
care about insulin we want to keep insulin low so this is a really good
combination of what to eat okay so we have some protein vegetables fat all
right no snacks to meals okay number two you're gonna need to sleep most fat
burning occurs when you are in deep sleep you cannot do this with five to
six hours of sleep you need eight hours minimum now even if you have to get a
nap that's totally fine if you can do that but we need to go for eight hours
there's two things I like to do to enhance my sleep
one is I do a lot of stretching before bed number two I use this thing right
here it's adrenal night formula this stuff is very powerful it doesn't have
any melatonin basically supports the adrenal gland it
chills out the adrenal gland normally take one before bed I would take two to
really get that eight hours of sleep you won't feel groggy you wake up feeling
refreshed and it'll enhance the sleep okay so that's one thing the next thing
is stress if you're going through stress it's going to be a barrier because
stress activates the hormone called cortisol that blocks the fat burning so
what we want to do is we want to list all your stressors and it's probably
gonna be related to people and avoid those people for one week and you're
gonna find surprisingly you will actually lose more weight because if you
keep running into this situation over and over with these stressful people
it's not helpful I also recommend no watching the news
for one week watch a comedy we eat a book because we don't want to interfere
that have a stress interfere with the sleep we don't want that negativity and
then we want to do long walks okay so we want to walking is really good and just
getting space so that's what we're gonna do for stress there's a lot of other
things but this will be helpful and also how sleeping more will help stress as
well now exercise you want to do high in high intensity interval training that
means that you want to work the whole body right now I do a combination of
bike when it's not too cold out and I do sprints I do rock climbing I do
deadlifts which with a good posture but you want to find something that fits
your interest but you want to do something really high full-body upper
and lower body short duration high intensity but only do that every two
days why because we want to get that recovery all the benefits from exercise
happens in the recovery you don't want to do it every day unless you're really
in shape and even every other day might not be the best thing if you're been
suffering from sleep and stress so it really is kind of a juggle but twice I
mean I've taken people in decrease the frequency of their workouts and help
them lose a lot more weight and it's quite interesting how that you it's
counterintuitive but it works on the days you're not working out you're going
to go for a long walks and just gonna walk and just get space so that's what
you're gonna do if you're sighs nutrition seek help seek help why
because seek help activates the thyroid to speed up the metabolism only consume
seek help in the morning take one or two in the morning taking the little tablets
and don't take them before you go to bed because it'll keep you up at night
potassium citrate now they have potassium chlorate I'm gonna recommend
you get potassium citrate and whatever it says in the bottle 5 exit it's going
to be like 99 milligrams so you're gonna do 500 milligrams now that's not even
hardly a dent into the potassium requirements that you need because you
need 4700 milligrams so why are we recommending potassium citrate because
as you're burning fat getting into a ketogenic diet you you're gonna be
losing a little bit of potassium we want to put the potassium in potassium will
lower the need for insulin potassium will enhance your asleep potassium will
prevent kidney stones potassium will help relax the muscles and it'll
actually help your energy so again I normally don't recommend one individual
mineral without the others in a combination but we're just talking about
dropping some serious weight and you don't have to do this long-term just
short-term and it's really difficult I know it's hard to believe it's difficult
for people to consume the amount of vegetables that they need they need
about 7 to 10 cups a day I'm trying to get people to have even 7 cups a day so
they're not getting their potassium you need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every
day to get your potassium so we can enhance it a little bit short-term but
you're going to need to do at least 5 X that ok so calcium potassium citrate the
only contraindication would be if you have kidney disease which is very highly
unlikely so then you wouldn't want to do that but it's you're gonna be fine
nutritional yeast why nutritional yeast you can get from
the health food store it's loaded with natural be vital mints it's going to
handle kind of the stress it's gonna help the excessive thinking it's gonna
help chill out the adrenal glands it's gonna
tie everything in here but these are the most
powerful things that you can do now you might have individual specific issues
like bad mental cramps or a body issue or whatever if you have a more complex
case and you need more help I think the most cost-effective way to do this is to
do my membership site I have a membership site that's very inexpensive
and you get my guidance and I actually give you lessons a little bit each time
like you actually go through one step at a time so it's not confusing because
people get overwhelmed so I like to kind of spoon-feed you so you can go from
this point to this point slowly at your own pace and you can get the knowledge
get the results having me as a backup if you have questions so I put a link below
definitely check it out and I think we would love to have you as part of a
member so I hope this was beneficial thank you so much for watching and click

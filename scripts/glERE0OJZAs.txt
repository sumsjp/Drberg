let's talk about the dangers of someone giving you the wrong diagnosis this is something that's
very common yet can create a lot of problems if you're diagnosed and treated incorrectly
not to mention these side effects from all the drugs that you'll be getting unnecessarily so the
worst thing that a person get is that you have this disease or this diagnosis yet when it's
actually another problem it's never going to be solved if you have the wrong diagnosis to diagnose
someone you need to evaluate them with complete data and true data now i'm going to give you a
little example of a recent situation where i had some people responding to something in the news
that said the ketogenic diet now has been proven by scientific studies to cause heart problems okay
well there's other data to show that the ketogenic diet helps prevent heart problems right so when
you have conflicting information you have to start asking questions you have to start digging
into the data and looking at it yourself because sometimes when you look at second-hand information
where someone's giving you their opinion about another study it could be slightly flawed so if
you actually look at the data and you read it yourself it was a study involving mice and they
were on the ketogenic diet so i thought until i found out that it wasn't the ketogenic diet at all
it was a high fat high carbohydrate diet just because something is high fat doesn't make it keto
keto is low carb so the percentage of carbs that they put these mice on were 30 percent
well keto is around 5 carbs so that was an example of false data let's give you some other examples
let's say we have gerd this is a disorder where the the valve on the top of the stomach doesn't
close so you have acid that comes up and so if you read on this they'll talk about genetics
maybe some environmental things but it doesn't actually tell you the actual underlying cause
evaluating someone's diet is not looked at very much in the medical profession and unfortunately
this data is very very important because if this is not added into the equation and it's not looked
at closely you're going to come up with different conclusions and a different treatment and so you
also have to understand that some data is more important than others so if you're focusing on
the genes which you really can't change too much versus the diet which you can change
this would be way way more important let's take a slow metabolism right a lot of times people will
say well it's your your thyroid is slow so let's say you do a test and you find out the thyroid
is low so then what causes that they just say well you don't your thyroid is deficient and
we can just keep treating it right so you're on medication for a very long time and so we're not
really actually getting deeper into why first of all when we evaluate this we have to be complete
about it and we have to have all the data here's some extra data ninety percent of all hypothyroid
cases are hashimoto's that's an autoimmune problem autoimmune problems relate to the gut
another piece of data that's rarely evaluated when you're looking at these connections so let's say
for example a person doesn't have an autoimmune disease then you have to look at other reasons for
a hypothyroid problem well there's a liver problem if there's a gallbladder problem simply because 80%
of that conversion from t4 to t3 happens through the liver and the 20% happens through the kidney
also if you're high in estrogen that can inhibit the thyroid hormone this is why
women sometimes when they go through pregnancy when they get this spike of estrogen end up with
a slow thyroid this is just using all the data that's available to evaluate the most likely
cause of the problem now they might say a slow metabolism is that you just eat too many
calories right this has been completely disproven because how do you explain the skinny people that
can eat like a horse and they never gain weight and then you have the conclusion a lot of people
make is well you're just eating too many calories but that doesn't give you the whole picture it's
not all about calories usually if someone has a slow metabolism and a problem with their set point
so let's say they lose weight and they get down to 150 pounds but they can't seem to get below that
that is related to insulin resistance another piece of data that is rarely evaluated or added
into the equation if you fix insulin resistance which by the way when you have insulin resistance
many times you have high insulin you fix the metabolism you fix the set point okay then you
have high blood pressure which is a very common diagnosis which is related to genetics and risk
factors and smoking and all these things that are factors but are they the most important pieces of
data usually not because the most important data when you're evaluating blood pressure
it should be potassium and vitamin d and high insulin these three things will raise blood
pressure faster than anything else but if this is not evaluated the person ends up on medication
for the rest of their life one last story i had a patient who came in with heart pain
she's been to the emergency room other doctors the cost for all the testing was forty thousand
dollars okay and so here's another really important tool when you evaluate you wanna get
a complete history when did it start this question was never asked okay so i found it happened like
i think a week previously on a tuesday i said what time she said five o'clock i said then what
happened right before this what did you eat well we found out what she ate a huge banana split okay
she rarely ever does that i already know when you eat those type of foods you're going to sometimes
affect the gallbladder and that sometimes can create the blockage which can create pressure
which can then back up in the liver which can then affect the heart so i knew about that link
i said lay on the table did some gentle massage in the area of digestion and her heart pain went
away and it never came back so this is just using this simple little question right here and so can
you imagine if she was actually diagnosed with some heart defect and they actually
did surgery that would be devastating and so it's important when you evaluate to get all the data
make sure it's true data understand that some data is more important than others and definitely do
a complete history thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to
bulletproof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you
here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here
avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system
that's what's missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you
can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system
i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

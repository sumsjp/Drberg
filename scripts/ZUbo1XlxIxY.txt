so there's a lot of things that make us want to overeat snack way too much
that really interfere with intermittent fasting you have the flavorings of the food especially
processed foods that people have addictions to msg of course sugar empty calories that don't have the
nutrients that satisfy us people eat because they're bored there's stress but there's one
more thing that i actually forgot to mention in other videos and that has to do with distractions
i'm talking about when you eat and you watch tv at the same time or you're on your cell phone
the awareness of okay i had enough i'm done i'm full tends to be interfered with when you get
distracted so there's a couple different brain centers that control taste through your tongue
and then also smell which by the way is like 80 percent of taste and so this is why if you have
a cold your sense of taste is pretty it's pretty much shot so you have these receptors that are
picking up information cause you to be hungry eat and then the nutrient feedback loops are supposed
to come back and turn off that mechanism so you're full so you can stop eating so there's a couple
things that you need to do if you're in that situation number one you need to of course not
have that junk food available in your house very important so you're not tempted you also have to
be just increase your awareness of the perception of how full you are and how satisfied you are but
of course it's even more important to avoid those empty carbohydrates that will just never turn off
the hunger because they're empty and but they're very flavorful so you'll keep eating them
also chewing longer is another thing you can do there's even this gentleman who i read about a
while ago who they think his name was fletcher who was teaching at that time the most important thing
to maintain your weight and improve your digestion is to chew so he would recommend that you needed
to chew a hundred times before you swallowed that would definitely help you be more satisfied
because you're increasing your awareness of just chewing longer versus just inhaling it and not
really even chewing it you also have buying nuts in their shells like let's say you had
walnuts right you're going to snack on walnuts but you had to de-shell them that would be a barrier
that would add more time and of course at the very minimum you can have the pistachios with the
shells which take a little bit longer versus just a straight de-shelled nuts where you're just like
shoveling them in your mouth oh how about chopsticks right i know if i had to use chopsticks
i would go hungry right they're very complex i don't know how people use them and also if let's
say you had dinner and you're gonna have a keto snack right after or dessert really set a limit of
how much you're going to allow yourself to eat because if you're getting distracted whether
it's a social event and then all of a sudden you realize oh my gosh i just had way too many and
now you're bloated and you're congested and the next morning you wake up hungry because you ate
way too much and you factored your blood sugars so the motto of this video is mindful eating keeping
your awareness very high hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof

all right in this video we're going to talk about how many carbs should a diabetic consume on a
daily basis now for the answer it make perfect logical sense to go to the experts right the
people that are certified in this condition you know someone who has the mainstream credentials
let's take a look at what the experts say they recommend that 45 to 60 of your calories should
be from carbohydrates no i'm not kidding so if your daily calories are 1800 divided by two
they're recommending 900 calories be carbohydrates that comes out to 225 grams of carbohydrates
per day now they also say that there's no magical exact number of carbs you should take appetite and
hunger does play a role in this condition but i don't know about you but this is completely
an utter insanity now why in the world would you ever want to give someone who has too many carbs
in their blood more carbs i mean if your house is burned down are you going to dump more gasoline
in the house it just makes no logical sense here's an example of what's being recommended
for breakfast one half cup of oats one cup of low-fat milk two-thirds of a banana not a whole
banana but two-thirds of a banana because these calories do count one-fourth cup of walnuts lunch
two slices of whole wheat bread four ounces of lean turkey one slice of low-fat cheese one
half of a tomato eight baby carrots dinner one skinless chicken breast
one cup of brown rice two tablespoons of margarine don't forget the snack at night with the fruit or
nuts and the snack between lunch and dinner this is a recipe for disaster if you are a diabetic
and you're new to my channel you need to click down below at the end of this video
to get more information on what you should be eating because if you follow this recommendation
you're going to have a heck of a time ever coming off your medications now i do want to make a
disclaimer check with your doctor before taking my advice okay this is just my opinion usually
a diabetic type 2 is not on insulin but sometimes they are and so they may use this mealtime insulin
formula where you have this carb gram dose formula which is based on the insulin the carb ratio so if
you're eating more carbs you'll take so much more insulin i mean here's my thought where
do you think the carbs are going when you take the insulin or you take any medication are they
magically evaporating now they're being taken from one place and moved to another place in
your body so you're just basically taking this one problem and giving your body another problem
all right what can you do the most scientific thing is to reduce your carbs down to
less than 50 grams per day preferably lower than that maybe 20 grams per day that would be a
very smart thing to do because now the need for insulin goes way down and guess what else goes
down your appetite and your hunger if you don't reduce your carbs you're always going to be hungry
and you're going to have a large appetite you're going to be craving carbs making it really hard
to stick to any program to help you lose weight number two very important stop
snacking we're not stopping snacking to reduce calories we're stopping snacking
to do intermittent fasting because eating triggers insulin apply intermittent fasting
by arranging your meals so you're only doing two meals a day do not worry about calories
actually add more fat to the meal so you can go longer and fast and that's going to
greatly help you increase more healthy fats to allow you to fast longer i just mentioned that
and stop the so called healthy carbs and that would be the fruits and the whole grain bread
and of course the brown rice now one other point that you should know when you go low-fat milk or
protein or lean turkey or skinless chicken breast you're increasing the concentration of protein
and based on the insulin index which is a scale of all the non-carbohydrate foods in
relationship to stimulating insulin you're going to get a much higher spike when you go low-fat
protein than if you consume the food in the whole form where it originally came with a certain
amount of fat all right number six salt when you actually start restricting your salt you increase
the risk of insulin resistance you actually worsen your blood sugar so don't be afraid to take some
sea salt himalayan sea salt is the best because himalayan sea salt doesn't have the microplastics
that are in some of the other sea salts and then your fat you want to make sure you avoid omega-6
fat and that would be avoiding the soy oil the canola the corn oil which is highly inflammatory
and that alone can increase the risk of diabetes instead increase your omega-3 fatty acids
fatty fish like salmon is a real good alternative all right that was a very long answer to this
question but keep your carbs between 20 and 50 grams and your body will be very very happy

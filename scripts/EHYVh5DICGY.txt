there's a very ignored but vital function of your stomach that i'm going to talk about today
normally people know the stomach helps you digest protein like meats and things like that and then
it's supposed to turn into amino acids which are the building blocks of protein so then your body
can then use that to make body tissue another function of the stomach is to help you absorb
minerals like iron calcium and zinc and b12 another function of the stomach is to stimulate
the pancreas to release enzymes to help you digest food and another function is
to stimulate the bile production and also your gallbladder to help release the bile to help
you start breaking down fats to then extract the fat soluble vitamins from the food that you eat
but another very important function of the stomach is to kill pathogens now what's a pathogen
a pathogen is not a friendly bacteria so your stomach is designed to kill pathogens
and to prevent foodborne illnesses and so your stomach has a huge function of immune defense
so what's in a stomach that helps you defend against these pathogens number one it's the
hydrochloric acid in both quantity and ph if you lose the acidity of your stomach acids
okay so the ph normally should be between one and three and let's say it goes up higher to four or
five or six or even seven you're not going to have that immune protection because it's the
concentration of acid that kills these microbes as well as the stimulation of certain enzymes
that actually dissolve these microbes but you have other things in your stomach too that can help you
like lactofurrin which is very very high in colostrum which is milk to help a baby
develop their immune system but lactoferrin also is antibacterial and anti-fungal in the stomach
you also have other antibacterial peptides which are proteins which help defend against microbes
and so if you have low stomach acids or the ph is not concentrated or strong enough you start having
side effects like infections in the lower part of your gastrointestinal tract you can have sibo
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in which you have too many bacteria in the wrong place normally
you shouldn't have a lot of bacteria in your small intestine most of it should be in the large
intestine if it's in the small intestine you're going to have a lot of problems with bloating gas
etc so without enough hydrochloric acid you can get sibo you can get heartburn you can get acid
reflux gerd and of course what's the treatment for that and acids tums ppis like proton pump
inhibitors baking soda what does all that do it lessens the amount of concentrated hydrochloric
acid in your stomach and that leads to a domino effect of then not being able to kill pathogens
and then you end up with more pathogens lower in your in your gastrointestinal tract
and you have just a whole series of problems so without enough hydrochloric acid you get bloating
gas definitely indigestion increased risk for allergies anemia mineral deficiencies especially
calcium iron and zinc and by the way a deficiency of zinc can then lead to ulcers which then you
treat with antacids right but also h pylori can cause ulcers and sometimes they'll treat h pylori
with antacids which then worsens the whole cycle creating more ulcers and more need for antacids
so not good and also you can end up with a bile deficiency like i already mentioned that hcl helps
you release and make bile and if you don't have enough bile you're not going to have vitamin a
d e or k or omega 3. more problems you can also end up with enzyme deficiency so you're not
going to have enough enzymes to digest so you're going to have a lot of problems with digesting
food but anyway i wanted to create this video to talk about another function of the stomach
that a lot of people are not aware of if you haven't seen my other videos on hydrochloric
acid i put them down below check them out hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my
content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below

now the problem with diarrhea especially chronic diarrhea is that you lose a lot of
nutrition zinc is a very important trace mineral that you can lose with diarrhea and it can be
life-threatening if you have chronic diarrhea so of course the best thing to do is to put back in
those things that are lost electrolytes good friendly bacteria take a good probiotic putting
back in lactic acid will make you feel a lot better as well kombucha tea is a good
source of lactic acid and in the past i would recommend blackberries blending blackberries
with plain organic kefir as a really good remedy for diarrhea but i have a better remedy for you
and that's using organic green bananas now there is a kind of a conventional standard protocol for
diarrhea that the medical profession uses where they're recommending bananas but not green bananas
actual ripe bananas which i don't recommend they recommend rice apples and toast okay so
the acronym is rat now the problem with this is yes you're going to feed the microbes but you're
also going to spike the blood sugars and this is why consuming the green banana is going to be much
better because you're not going to have that spike in blood sugars because a green banana contains
what's called resistant starch and so your body doesn't absorb the fiber it's left the microbes to
eat and turn that into small chain fatty acids and then these small chain fatty acids help you retain
the fluid so you're not constantly losing all this water plus the green bananas have some nutrition
it has some potassium and other nutrients and you want to make sure that you cook the green bananas
or you can fry them with sea salt the sea salt is really good because typically you're going to lose
a lot of salt when you have diarrhea all right so i just wanted to give a really good remedy
for diarrhea if you ever happen to get it and of course you want to eliminate the source of
whatever caused this diarrhea and one last point if you have chronic diarrhea that is a very very
serious situation because if you're chronically losing all this nutrition it can create some
serious long-term effects so if you have chronic diarrhea definitely get that evaluated to see
what's really behind that it could be some parasite it could be a whole series of things
all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you're benefiting from any of my content

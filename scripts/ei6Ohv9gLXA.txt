so in this video we're going to talk about using iodine topical iodine for skin tags
now you can also use this for warts as well now there's some real interesting data which i'll put
the links down below that shows that using topical iodine can inactivate the papillomavirus which
is behind warts and skin tags now as far as the relationship between this virus causing skin tags
they don't know this for a fact but i think that this virus is behind skin tags simply because
skin tags respond to iodine topical iodine now the type of iodine i would recommend for this
is povidone iodine it's an over-the-counter iodine you can get it anywhere and you just put a little
drop on the skin tag and do that for several days in a row you can put a little band-aid over it
and watch what happens now you can also do the same thing with a wart
human papilloma viruses are the most common sexually transmitted infection this virus is also
behind cervical cancer now because of the fact that iodine is antibacterial antiviral anti-yeast
anti-fungal anti-mold it would make sense to me that if you had enough iodine in your diet
that it could potentially help you reduce the risk for some of these problems because what you have
to realize is that a lot of these viruses can go in and out of remission they can stay dormant if
there's enough protection and trace minerals like iodine is one way to keep these viruses
in the dormant remission stage and there's quite a few other trace minerals that also will help
put viruses back in remission and zinc is also at the top of the list now as far as warts and skin
tags i think it's a no-brainer to use a topical iodine all right try it out and comment down below

this topic today is how much liver can we live without it's kind of a weird question so
let's just say how much liver do you need to function normally how much liver do we really
need to maintain normal liver function and this is pretty bizarre because you only need 25 percent
so the liver is really robust and apparently we have about 75 percent of the liver that acts as a
buffer and we can live without that if necessary of course it's not the ideal situation but we
actually don't need much liver to maintain normal liver function now this is good and bad news
because sometimes people think wow i can pretty much eat what i want because i don't need much
my liver so i'm just going to push the envelope and ride the wave and then when i need a new liver
i'll just get a transplant well that's one way to look at things i don't think it's probably
the best way because there's a transplant list that you have to get on which takes a long time
but as a plan b they do have another option it's called living liver donation so you just
talk your friend or family member into donating some of their liver like 50% of the liver so then
that way you actually can get a transplant it's a little bit different because you're not getting
the whole liver you're getting partial liver and it has to regrow back but that comes with
two problems number one you have to find a friend or a family member which has the same blood type
as you do and they're willing to give it up now the other problem you might run into is that
you might have to take anti liver rejection
drugs so there's usually antibodies that are going to develop that are going to attack this new liver
they involve usually steroids so you have to take those they have side effects
but if you can overcome those side effects what's very fascinating is that the liver
can regenerate at an accelerator rate most of the liver regeneration will occur in two
to four weeks after getting this transplant which is amazing the liver is the only
visceral organ that can regenerate it takes a beating and it just keeps coming back now
you probably have seen some of my other videos on youtube and i always like to just give you
some important tips to maintaining liver function just because some people need
to be reminded over and over and over number one you want to avoid the triggers that will
cause liver damage in the first place of course alcohol junk food sugar are all at the top
of the list number two you want to establish a new eating plan and i'm talking about healthy keto now
i actually have a book that describes the four body types and the diet that you would
most benefit from would be the diet for the liver body type so you can actually look at that
intermittent fasting is going to be essential for the reduction of inflammation also the stimulation
of stem cells that will help you regenerate liver tissue there are also some really important key
nutrients that you need to take vitamin d roughly about twenty thousand IUs to
keep your inflammation really low because it's really the inflammation that creates
the damage from liver problems in general tocotrienols which is a type of vitamin e which is
very important in preventing a fatty liver developing into an inflamed liver which eventually
develops into a fibrotic liver or a liver with scar tissue bile salts are really important as
you lose liver function you also lose your ability to make bile so by taking bile salts you can also
help slow down the fibrosis in the liver because bile salts are anti-fibrotic and the last thing
take probiotics there's a huge connection between your microbes and your gut and liver function i
did an entire video on this i'll put a link down below all right there you have it and that's all
i have to say about the liver today thanks for watching before you go if you have a question
about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and
you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you
this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call
but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help

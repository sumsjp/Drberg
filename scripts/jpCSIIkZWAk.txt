hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to share with you some data on
whether you should have a breakfast or whether you shouldn't now in the past I
always recommended that everyone have a breakfast no matter what and that was
based on several studies that were done that were very very credible including
my own experience and experiences of many many many many people
okay I need breakfast okay but as time went on I found not every body type not
every person needs a breakfast and in really the determining factor is are you
hungry or not if you're not hungry do not eat why because when you have the
breakfast lunch and dinner at dinner and by the way we don't want to snack
between the meals but at dinner we want to start to fast fast all night long
until the morning now your body during this time is burning fat as fuel why
would we necessarily want to break the fast if you're not hungry
you're actually eating your own fat as your breakfast we won that we want to
keep that going on and maybe you're hungry later later as a brunch or maybe
for actual lunch so that's that would be the first meal of the day and then you
only have two meals so the advantage of doing that is huge for weight loss okay
and it's also good to heal insulin resistance which is a condition where
your insulin is all messed up and it's too high and not going to lose weight
and your metabolism is slow so if you were to have two meals a day if you can
get away with that that would be really awesome but personally myself I need a
breakfast so with breakfast and then the lunch and then sometimes I don't eat a
dinner in fact I probably I'll have something really really really light
because I'm not really hungry so I think with me it's just reversed I might do
these meals large meals and this is very very small and then I go like that so
it's kind of very similar but the point is that if you're not hungry
and you eat it will not stimulate metabolism eating does not stimulate
metabolism it slows metabolism down because it increases insulin and the
goal is to lower insulin to heal your metabolism because when insulin goes up
you will not burn fat okay when this one's down you burn fat and just eating
stimulates metabolism unites insulin so again if you're not hungry don't eat if
you're hungry go ahead and have a breakfast and of course make sure
there's no hidden sugars in the breakfast or juice and pancakes and
things like that you want kind of approaching breakfast if you're going to
have one okay I just want to make this point this is kind of an update because
some of my other videos I tell people always have a breakfast but not if
you're not hungry see you in the next video

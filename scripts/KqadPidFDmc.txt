so let's talk about the evolution or the origin of vitamin d it's quite fascinating
phytoplankton has been on this planet for about i don't know 750 million years it's been unchanged
and phytoplankton exposes itself to sunlight and makes vitamin d now there's a compound
in the environment called squalene it's an ancient molecule it's an oil that lives between rocks by
the seashore plants make it animals make it but it's a precursor to cholesterol and
steroid hormones now i'm not going to get into the complex biochemistry of this but
all you need to know is that that's like the raw material that eventually turns into
vitamin d because vitamin d comes from cholesterol now originally phytoplankton uses certain things
from the sun's rays to create different chemicals within the living organism itself
and one of the problems way back on this planet is that we didn't have an ozone layer so back then
without the protection of the ozone layer there was quite a bit of damage that was created from
this uv radiation and so organisms experienced dna damage so somehow vitamin d was created to protect
the organisms from developing damage from this uv radiation from the sun and so as time went on
this mechanism was transferred up the food chain first into fatty fish as you know salmon has a lot
of vitamin d and so does cod liver oil and so life forms took advantage of a very abundant mineral
called calcium and so they use calcium for neuromuscular communication cellular communication
using calcium in their skeletal structure to make it very very hard like cement
as well as an electrolyte in the communication of nerves and the contraction and relaxation of
muscles as you know if you don't have enough calcium you get a lot of muscle spasms
and this is why in our own bodies if you're deficient in calcium
you're going to get low back tightness spasm and pain and so one of the most important functions in
both animals and humans in relationship to vitamin d is calcium absorption and the utilization
of calcium in the small intestine vitamin d helps absorb calcium by 20 times so without that vitamin
d you're not going to absorb calcium and you can have a lot of problems osteoporosis osteopenia
osteomalacia which is your bones become soft and if a pregnant mother is deficient in vitamin d
that child is going to be deficient in calcium and potentially could have scoliosis flat feet
hunchback swayback and even rickets in which the legs are kind of bowed and so i've done a lot of
videos on vitamin d in relationship to your immune system acting as an anti-inflammatory
helping prevent autoimmune diseases but the big function of vitamin d is in what it does
to calcium and so if you're deficient in vitamin d your bones aren't going to work calcium will also
accumulate on the inside of your arteries in your joints is arthritis it can even increase risk
of heart attacks and vitamin d also works with vitamin k2 as well we don't want to forget that
and so just as photosynthesis occurs in plants we also have a type of photosynthesis that converts
the sun not into energy in our bodies but into vitamin d which actually is not really a vitamin
it's a hormone now if you haven't seen my other videos in vitamin d i put them up right here
check them out hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune
system it's a free course i want you to take it and here's why here's you here is your environment
everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but
what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's missing
this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist
your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

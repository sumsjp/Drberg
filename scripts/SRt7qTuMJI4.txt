so i wanted to create a quick video on an awesome remedy
for a condition called lichen planus okay now what is lichen planus
it's a chronic inflammatory autoimmune skin
condition and it can show up in different ways
it can show up on your skin on the back of the hands on the forearms and the
shin as these little red plaquing blotches
with little white streaks in them they can show up
on the tongue they can show up in the mucous membranes on the inside of your
mouth they can show up on your nails with the
vertical ridges they really can destroy the nail big time it affects not only
the outside of the skin but sometimes the inner part of the skin it
can even go into the esophagus into the trachea it can even go into the
vocal cords even on the cornea it can really create a lot of problems
but there's a very good safe natural remedy okay
and that is called purslane this is like a
a weed that you see growing between the sidewalk
and you can even take it as a dietary supplement as an extract
for this condition i'm going to put a link down below
of a study that was done that shows significant decrease
in symptoms from lichen planus there's virtually no side effects and
it's been shown to be clinically effective now why
would this work what's unique about this weed well first of all it's an immune
modulator okay so it helps to regulate the immune system
very similar to vitamin d but with a different mechanism
so it affects the t cells in different parts of the immune system so
this is probably the big reason why it works because
this condition is an autoimmune condition
it's filled with antioxidants trace minerals
vitamins it's nutrient dense and the other thing that's very unique about it
it has the highest plant source of ala which is an omega-3 fatty acid it's like
a precursor to epa in dha but it has
even more ala than walnuts if you have this condition this remedy

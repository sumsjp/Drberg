hello so we're going to talk about is being acid unhealthy I hear this so much where everyone
needs to alkalize or you're going to die right that we need to alkalize the body because acid
is unhealthy first of all you need to know that your body has different acid and alcohol levels
it's not just one for example your saliva ranges between 6.5 and 7.5 so just realize 7 is neutral
anything higher is alkaline anything lower is acid okay so we got six point five that's slightly acid
seven point five it's slightly alkaline so your saliva should range and by the way when you go
from a seven to an eight that's by a factor of ten times more alkaline or seven to six is ten
times more acid so it's it's it's magnified so it's a lot of is slightly alkaline side slightly
acidic small intestine seven to eight point five so your small intestine is usually slightly aklan
but the large intestine is between four and six that's acid interesting so check out the blood
it's a very very narrow range between seven point three five slightly alkaline and seven point four
or five which is a little more alkaline it's such a narrow range that's interesting to me
that it's that tight of a controlled pH so I guess when people talk about being acid
or alkaline or alkalosis or acidosis they're really talking about the pH and the blood so
if your pH is between like seven point four six or seven or eight you're going to basically be
have alkalosis if it's seven point three four or seven point three three you're going to be have
acidosis even though it's off just slightly okay but that's a whole different seminar the point I
want to make is that your body has different ph's in different fluids your stomach should be between
one and three you realize how acid that is it's like seriously like acid it's like battery acid
your urine should be between four point five and six point O acid so we got the large intestine
the stomach and the large and that urine should be acid a lot of the other fluids to be Ocwen so
this whole thing that everyone should be alkaline is kind of like what tissue you talking about the
purpose of having the right pH is that it allows the body to then release or activate enzymes let
me give an example if your stomach is not acid enough it will not release the enzyme pep case
the most powerful Pro T attic or protein enzyme so you're not going to digest protein so what's
going to happen with that you're going to get undigested protein allergies if the stomach is
not asked enough you're not going to be able to kill off viruses and bacteria and microbes if the
stomach is not acid you're not going to absorb minerals you'll become anemic so there's a lot
of issues with just not activating enzymes also you need these differences in pH is to move fluid
through the body to have things move if your body was just one pH things would just be stagnant they
wouldn't move that well so we need the diversity so the next time someone says oh yeah you're too
acid you need alkalis you're like ask them what tissue are you talking about what fluid are you
talking about on the blood and then it's really hard to test the blood pH so you can soon as you
take it on the body it oxidizes with air and it changes the pH so rarely does anyone ever test it
so you got to go by symptoms basically but the pH that does change probably the only pH that doesn't
change dramatically out of all these fluids is the stomach pH as you age from twenty to thirty
to forty to fifty to sixty seven years old look at how far down your stomach pH goes down you lose
the acid in your ph in your stomach becomes more alkaline so the danger of that is that
you're going to lose the digestion so red meats going to be hard to assimilate so you're going
to get kind of like gas and bloating if you have too much you're going to have gas is a perfect
indication of low stomach acids floating as well also you need the strong pH to act to release the
enzymes from the pancreas and the gallbladder it releases bile so you just don't get those
digestive secretions and then you end up with more bloating if you combine to many different
foods at once especially with sugar you're going to get some Suton and you don't have enough acid
your stomach gonna get some serious bloating in your stomach so we need a really strong
pH so the older you get the worse the pH is in the stomach and then because the valve doesn't
close you get GERD and things like that but what do people take when they have indigestion acid
reflux or heartburn they take anti acids so the older you get and the more you're taking
any acids what are you doing you're taking that last bit of acid that you had and you're making
a go bye-bye so the older you are the more acidic you need to start you need to start putting things
back in there like that's why I recommend outside of vinegar so it's so important if
you just took everyone over the age of 50 and put them on opposite of vinegar you would see
some amazing changes in digestion but but over time your blood peach doesn't go you don't lose
acid in your blood pH you don't lose in this lab or small intestine it's mainly in the stomach so
that's the area that I would recommend focusing on so being too acid unhealthy no not if you're
talking about the stomach if you don't like taping up a side of inner because of irritate
your teeth whatever you can take it as a pill form episode of vinegar plus I'm changing the
name to digestion digest support but this is good to take right before meal to help improve
the completeness of your digestion specifically with proteins and to help support a healthy pH
in your stomach all right thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing
evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of
all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you report

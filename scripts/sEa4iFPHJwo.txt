so this is a question that came up recently why are my triglycerides high when i'm doing keto now
normally they should be low so if they're high there's several reasons for this now a couple
things you need to know your fat is a storage place for triglycerides and when you do keto
guess what happens they're mobilized they come out of the fat cell they're they're there to
be used as energy and by the way you also have cholesterol stored in the fat cell as well and
that has to come out too so before i kind of get into the nitty gritty of this video there's some
real basic things you need to know unfortunately certain doctors are no longer recommending
fasting before you get your cholesterol tested or your triglyceride levels tested so
if you just consume a bunch of fat and you go get a test i mean you may have high triglycerides just
from that so i would recommend fasting 12 to 14 hours before you get a test very very
important and i'm talking about when you fast not eating anything except just drinking water
that includes not drinking coffee because sometimes when you drink too much coffee
it can stimulate the release of triglycerides and create higher triglycerides temporarily especially
if you're drinking bulletproof coffee as well with the mct oil so these are just things that you need
to look at now the other thing i want to point out is that if you consume alcohol two days before the
test or you went off keto and you consumed a lot of carbs two days before the test that can also
show up as higher triglycerides so i just want to bring that up now a hypothyroid condition could
also cause you to have high triglycerides because it's slowing down your metabolism
having a problem with your gallbladder could also give you high triglycerides there's a condition
called xanthomas which are those little fatty accumulations in the top part of your eyelids
that comes from a liver issue because the bile is not being produced to break down
these fats now the bile receptor called the fxr receptor has everything to do
with controlling triglycerides in your body and i'm talking about the production of triglycerides
the control of excess triglycerides as well as the burning of triglycerides for energy so if there is
a bile deficiency either because there's a problem with the liver in the production of bile or
some blockage in the gallbladder or you don't have sufficient microbes to make bile
because your microbes do make bio it's another reason why you might have high triglycerides
now transitional keto when you first start keto your triglycerides usually are going to go
up for a very short period of time and then they're going to come down so that could be
your situation another reason is that you may have hidden carbohydrates so there's some carbohydrates
that you're consuming that you're not aware of that can actually spike the triglycerides and also
fats in general so if you're doing a lot of liquid fats like the bulletproof coffee where you're
adding butter or mct oil and you're wondering why your triglyceride's a little bit higher especially
if you're not very active because it's all about fuel and using that fuel that could be another
reason so i'm just kind of giving you a lot of different reasons you can look at i wouldn't be
concerned i would just isolate what your problem is and address it before you go if you have a
question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're
on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing
by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we'll be able

did you realize that there's a friendly fungus in your gut it's not just bacteria you have friendly
fungus in fact there's over a hundred different strains of friendly fungus that is growing inside
of you for a very specific reason which we're going to get into now it's the friendly bacteria
that keep this fungus in checked so it doesn't overgrowth and become pathogenic as in candida
for example now candida is a yeast and so there's a lot of confusion between what is the difference
between a yeast and a fungus well yeast are small fungi so that's the relationship so we
have a lot of microbes growing in our body we have friendly bacteria we have friendly yeast there's
other types of microbes when you're healthy they're non-pathogenic now fungus is essential
for your soils in fact there are trillions of microorganisms and just a small amount of
soil and just one small function of fungus in the soil is to break down organic material and then
take the minerals in the soil that are not soluble to the plant and convert that into a soluble form
of mineral and so it adds amino acids and it makes it very soluble for the plant to absorb
so without fungus you're going to have a depletion of nutrients in that plant
and then the plant actually exchanges with the fungus carbohydrate so it actually can feed and
attract the fungus to help exchange minerals for some food so that's just one of the many
functions that fungus will have in soil but in our bodies fungus helps us with many different
things but i'm going to primarily talk about what happens when you take an antibiotic the antibiotic
kills bacteria but it does not kill the fungus and then we have the situation where we have
nothing to keep the fungus in check and so then we get an overgrowth of fungus and this is when we
have like thrush candida uh fungal infections and this is why it's so important if you have to take
an antibiotic to also take a friendly yeast the one i'm going to recommend is sacromiosis balardi
so instead of waiting till you get a fungal infection and trying to kill it with some type of
medication or drug if you take this friendly yeast or fungus while you're taking the antibiotic
you can actually prevent the overgrowth the other thing is if you already have candida or you have
an infection you can take this friendly yeast to help get rid of it what you have to realize is
that these yeasts live on carbohydrates like sugar especially milk sugar so i would highly recommend
to avoid all sugar the other point i want to bring up is you might say well i don't take antibiotics
well the glyphosate in the gmo food can act like an antibiotic and create a similar situation
so unless you're doing non-gmo food you can also be susceptible to having this infection this
overgrowth of fungus it's very important to also consume fermented foods as in fermented vegetables
sauerkraut would be very very beneficial to help build up this friendly flora also another benefit
of taking this friendly fungus or yeast is to help clear up diarrhea that's caused from antibiotics
help you decrease the risk of getting h pylori if you have any type of gut infection this would be
a very good yeast to take also if you have any toxins that are created from fungal infections
a very good idea to take this as well as candida albicans now what's interesting about
candida albicans is that it acts like a mold outside the body when the temperatures are not
as high and then when you increase the temperature as in inside the body it morphs into a yeast
so candida can actually change into either a mold or a yeast there's similar microorganisms just
slightly different all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course
entitled how to bullet proof your immune system it's a free course i want you to take it and
here's why here's you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding
your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that's what's
missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate
and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put

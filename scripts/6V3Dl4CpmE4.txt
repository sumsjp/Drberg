hey guys it's me this is going to be a very unpopular video among women who are
taking birth control pills but I wanted to create a video just to increase
awareness on what's going on because I'm seeing a lot of problems with the
long-term effects of women that take birth control pills so there's two
reasons why they take it number one to prevent pregnancy number two because
their cycle is very uncomfortable or not regular
okay so birth control is basically estrogen but there's other forms of
birth control pill they might add a little bit of this a little bit of that
but there's there's risk factors that are attached to birth control pills
number one cancer if a woman gets breast cancer and then she's treated they
usually put her on tamoxifen that's an anti estrogen drug it blocks estrogen
why because estrogen triggers cancer but the problem is it's not your body's own
production of estrogen that that makes the cancer its environmental estrogen
there's things in the environment like pesticides insecticides herbicides and
also chemicals in the food supply that mimic estrogen and your basically your
body is bathed with estrogen GMO foods influence estrogen to genetically
modified foods it's in a lot of soy and corn and stuff that you don't even
realize you you're eating it especially in the animal industry so cancer is a
big one number one number two is fibroids what fibroids are little mini
tumors in the uterus they can be outside the uterus but a lot of women are
getting those because of the estrogen dominance type situation of too much
estrogen and then we have endometriosis it's another side effect of too much
estrogen and so if you have endometriosis or fibrosis what do they normally do
and they take them out but they grow back why because they haven't fixed the
root cause there's some environmental estrogen in the food supply that they're
eating that's triggering these it also could be their own ovaries producing too
much estrogen too but that's usually triggered by the environment and then we
really do they do a hysterectomy so then they remove those organs or they might
take off like a partial hysterectomy and leave
the ovaries but guess what the adrenal glands backed them up and the adrenal
glands make estrogen so we go from one problem to the next like you get an
overactive adrenal gland which causes belly fat that's why women again
hysterectomies start getting more weight gain in the midsection so then we have a
low thyroid because when you increase estrogen you decrease the thyroid
hormone and that's really what's underneath a lot of thyroid conditions
because they usually get a thyroid problem after pregnancy because the
spike in estrogen but no one ever checks the estrogen thing they just treat the
thyroid but they never lose weight because it's the wrong problem so a low
thyroid yeast infections acne weight gain mainly in the hips and the breast
area and the upper body's the little pooch below the belly button
the buttocks that's all estrogen dominant and I will guarantee those
people who have that tend to have more estrogen dominance or exposed to
estrogen cysts they might have cysts on the ovaries they might have cysts in the
breast that's an estrogen problem and just so you know as a one really good
natural remedy is sea kelp sea kelp has iodine and iodine natural plant-based
iodine is really good to regulate and lower the excess estrogen in the body
it's about that and I would also recommend the cruciferous food those two
together are really really good but you might say yeah but I don't want to
create a thyroid problem because cruciferous decreases iodine well that's
be conceived kelp so sea kelp with cruciferous perfect combination all
right so now what are some alternatives if you want to you know avoid getting
pregnant right condoms both for females and males diaphragm and the lady Q stick
and if you ever heard of that you can get them online they're little like
microscopes that you can put your saliva on one side and look up to the light and
if you're ovulating that means that you're very fertile there's like a
four-day window at date 15 or the mid cycle where you're the most chance for
getting pregnant and you'll see a kind of an image of a fern because the
hormones kind of cause this appearance in your saliva which is interesting
I don't know why but it does or if you're not ovulating it'll be a little
specks so you can kind of have a little guideline so if you did this and this I
think you'd be pretty protected but I'm just kind of talking about you just need
to make up your own mind if it's if it's worth it and the risk factors if you
absolutely have to take estrogen then make sure you're doing cruciferous to
kind of prevent certain types of cancers and organic iodine from the plant based sea kelp
just to help regulate that because at
least that'll give you some protection against the estrogen dominant and don't
ever take it for as long as a lot of people like like you probably seven
years is the max so those are some some alternatives that you can do but I want
to just kind of bring up your awareness and if the ovary itself is creating
heavy periods excessive bleeding PMS and that's why you're taking this I'm going
to create some videos on some really great solutions that you can do
naturally upcoming in the next couple of weeks so stay tuned on that but at
least I wanted to give you awareness on this problem with this it is a problem
and it doesn't usually happen right away but it's over a few years all right I'll
see you in the next video

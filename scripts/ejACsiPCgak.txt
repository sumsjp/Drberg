can you guess what the most carcinogenic nut is
it's actually the peanut but it's actually not the peanut because
a peanut is a legume or a bean and so the most sprayed actual nut is the walnut but in this video
we're going to talk about the legume the peanut so i probably should have said the most carcinogenic
bean or legume now here's the thing with peanuts they're grown in the ground okay in pods and they
contact the soil directly they're grown in wet warm human soils and the shells are not
like regular nuts they're softer they are more porous they can absorb more things to the soil
and so there's two big problems about peanuts number one they're very susceptible to getting
a fungus okay because they're grown in wet warm humid soils the fungus itself is not poisonous
it's the toxin that is given off from the fungus called an aflatoxin because it leads to
gallbladder and liver cancer so it's pretty poisonous and on top of that the peanut plant is
heavily sprayed so we have this combination of a lot of chemicals and a poisonous toxin other than
that it's perfectly fine so a simple solution is to go organic right very important but if you get
the valencia peanut which is grown in new mexico in dry soil you're not going to have this problem
this is what i get from trader joe's i do consume peanut butter on a regular basis
this is valencia peanuts and organic and it's just sea salt no added anything else that's the
one you want to get if by chance there's a little bit of aflatoxin in here the good thing is well
actually for me is i usually always consume peanut butter with celery and it just so happens that
celery and carrot and parsley reduce the carcinogenic effect of this toxin so
just another little tip when you consume peanut butter all right thanks for watching

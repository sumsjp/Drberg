so today we're going to talk about antioxidants and how to boost your
antioxidant levels now just so you know your body makes antioxidants okay
they're called endogenous antioxidants and also you can get them from your food
or supplements that's called exogenous antioxidants now why are these
antioxidants so important well because they actually neutralize something
called free radicals and they neutralize oxidants that can oxidize and create a
lot of problem in your body so they lessen the amount of damage in your
cellular machinery including the DNA okay so if you have damaged DNA that is
going to shorten your lifespan so you won't live as long you could potentially
get a disease develop cancer and also have a lot of other complications from
the disease from all the collateral damage so an antioxidant basically
donates one of its electrons to this free radical a free radical is an
unpaired electron so if you envision this little plate spinning with two
electrons that are nice and balanced but it only has one it's like going crazy
it's a radical that's going around and creating cellular damage your body will
donate an electron to balance it out so this is no longer a free radical and
it's chilled out but here's the problem now that antioxidant becomes a free
radical so what happens is it borrows electron from another antioxidant and so
on and so on and this is why antioxidants are in networks and another
reason why you should never buy and take a synthetic antioxidant like they have
synthetic vitamin E or a if you're taking those especially in higher
amounts and thinking you're getting benefits from the antioxidants realize
that they're just individual antioxidants so when they donate the
electron they themselves become a free radical so you're safe if you get these
in like whole complexes that come from food or
just get them from food itself so one of the most powerful antioxidants your body
has is glutathione and the liver and it's software-based
here are some foods that can help provide the raw materials for that
antioxidant high quality beef fish chicken definitely cruciferous
vegetables radish is very high in sulfur garlic is very high in sulfur onion very
high in sulfur spinach avocado asparagus all have massive amounts of antioxidants
and selenium which is the most powerful trace mineral antioxidant you get that
in Brazil nuts fish seafood sea kelp organ meats so you need certain trace
minerals to help build up your antioxidant networks now antioxidants
also are a part of the vitamin complexes so you know the scorebook acid is part
of the vitamin c complex you have to cough rawls as the antioxidant part of
the vitamin E now if I dominate of the beta carotene part which is the
antioxidant vitamin D acts as an antioxidant b1 acts as an antioxidant
and believe it or not ketones act as an antioxidant in your
body I don't know if you've heard of uric acid uric acid is probably the most
powerful antioxidant in the blood okay it protects their red blood cells from
oxidizing but it also causes gout if it's in certain amounts in the wrong
place so if your kidney is damaged and you're not able to get rid of it from
the kidney properly it can end up in the big toe but I do want to say that out of
all the antioxidants in your blood over 50% of those antioxidants are uric acid
so uric acid does help you in certain ways uric acid is also vital in
protecting the central nervous system it's also very beneficial and helping
decrease the collateral damage that occurs in Parkinson's and
even ms and even after you had a stroke even the structure called the
hippocampus needs uric acid to protect it and so many people consuming a high
carb diet for example are getting all this oxidation from the glucose which
destroys hippocampus and their memory starts to go and also their spatial
memory they can't recall where they are in time and space so they end up looking
for their car where did I park my car and they have a very difficult time of
finding things uric acid has some benefits as an antioxidant we have a
couple things we can do we can start eating foods with higher amounts of
antioxidants the cruciferous vegetables the vegetables in general I always
recommend 7 to 10 cups per day some people can't do that do what you can but
you can also take supplements like concentrated wheatgrass juice powder or
garlic or onion there's just a lot of different antioxidants that you can take
but just make sure they're actually from concentrated food not a synthetic
version of an antioxidant some other things you can do keep your stress down
because stress just oxidizes the body like crazy high levels of cortisol will
basically destroy the body also getting enough sleep will increase your
antioxidant Network exercise will stimulate more antioxidants in your body
as an adaptive process but hands down the biggest thing that will increase
your antioxidant Network is fasting intermittent fasting and periodic
prolonged fasting when you fast your genes flip over into this survival
mechanism and the body as a defense mechanism starts creating all these
antioxidants in certain networks to increase your longevity and also
parallel to that you have all these different repair actions that kick in so
start doing repair so you have a protective aspect and you have repair
even when people get cancer and they have to take chemotherapy fasting will
increase the antioxidants will decrease the oxidative stress so oxidative stress
is not having enough net work of antioxidants and having too much
oxidation all right guys there you have it and thanks for
watching hey with another amazing recipe no grains
no sugar totally keto there's no suffering in keto absolutely not Karen and
it's an immune system builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you
should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it's just so easy to be

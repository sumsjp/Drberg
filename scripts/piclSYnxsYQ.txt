hi guys in this video we're going to talk about how to reduce lung stress with a salt and hand
lever if you ever heard about this before it's really a cool mechanism and you use
it for asthma bronchitis allergies sinus mucus lung mucus sinus mucus hay fever COPD chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease sleep apnea sleep apnea that's spelled wrong and adrenal fatigue
okay so it looks like this and there's a lot of different ones you can get online and what you
do is like a neti pot it is a neti pot if you open up the bottom and you put Himalayan sea salt okay
a little baggie in here can you plug it up and you basically that's holes in it so it breathe
and you would breathe in and breathe out through your nose okay so you would do that slowly so you
don't hyperventilate for about five minutes okay once a day if you have a real major situation do
it twenty minutes a day you can break it up to the day do it even more but what happens the
ions from the sea salt it's like going to the beach all these incredible minerals go right
into the lung into the bloodstream and their antibacterial anti-inflammatory they support
the adrenals that's why people crave so much salt with the adrenal because when the dreams burned
out you lose the salt that recharges the cell so this recharges the body this loosens mucus that's
why I like even in the ocean if you have something it's kind of a natural disinfectant you know sea
water it just cleans everything suppresses an overly sensitive immune system so you might
want to get one of these they have real small ones they have larger ones and go ahead and do
this if you have any of these symptoms right here put your comments below hey you probably already

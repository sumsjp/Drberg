hey guys we are back and we have a special treat for you today what do we
have today we have some chia pudding because I love chia chia is
loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and I
always want to find ways to you know consume it so this is one what's the
ingredient this is called a creamy strawberry chia pudding and has fresh
strawberries in it and love how much how many strawberries it's a
it's a pint but for a serving size you're probably talking about a
tablespoon it's so small yeah this is a big I mean I wouldn't eat
this much in one sitting I just it's very unlikely it's going to bump you out
of ketosis small amount you're not doing large servings you're doing you know a
little bit mm-hmm I like it because it's nummy because I'm not a huge sugar
pudding fan but I love Chia I love the consistency not everybody does but so do I
you do it's a little crunchy oh I think it's like gelatin like it's addicting
mm-hmm a little crunch good there's some protein in there there's a lot of
nutrition a little bit of strawberry berries yeah it's very very fresh this
recipe is a real fresh taste it has a little lime zest in it I really like it
yeah and keep it right at the meal after the meal not as a snack between the meal
right all right so is this so this is meal time then for
us this is a dessert so we better eat more because now it must be meal time
meal time well because otherwise we'd be snacking what we're doing the video

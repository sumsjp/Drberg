food that can actually increase an
additional five years to your lifespan

240 people
over 65 years old for 11 years

consumption
of oily fish in your diet can increase
your lifespan by almost five additional
years that's significant they found that
omega-3 fatty acids in your red blood
cells
are a very good mortality risk predictor
now on the flip side
being a regular smoker can decrease your
lifespan
by 4.7 years
so if you do smoke on a regular basis if
you quit smoking and you start consuming
oily fish that can add almost 10 years
to your lifespan that is huge okay so

vegetarian you could do english walnuts

hey i'm back with another video in this
video we're going to talk about the best
nutrient
for fear now let me just clarify
so i'm talking about a body deficiency
that can put you
in this fierce state whether it's
anxiety
doom and gloom worry
panic attack paranoia even
claustrophobia
the nutrient deficiency that's most
likely to put you in this state of fear
is a vitamin b1 deficiency
you don't have enough thymine and
without enough thymine there's certain
parts of your body that just don't work
right you may have a problem with the
amygdala which is a certain structure in
your brain
that has a lot to do with fear
and anxiety you may have a problem with
the autonomic nervous system
and now you're in a state of flight or
fight mode
or there could be a problem with your
adrenals
now the absolute best way to get your b1
because i don't recommend taking a
synthetic version
is to take nutritional yeast you can get
it in a powder
you can also get in tablets just make
sure it doesn't come with
synthetic fortification because a lot of
times they add synthetic
b vitamins with the nutritional yeast
now some ways that you can become
deficient is you drink a lot of
tea drink a lot of coffee you consume a
lot of sugar
refined carbs especially for refined
grains
you're going through a lot of stress and
alcohol
all of these things right here can
deplete you
of b1 and there also could be a mutation
of something called the mthfr
gene in which case you're not converting
certain b
vitamins like folate you're not
converting folate to the active form
and this actually is not very rare it's
like in 20
of the population and there's a certain
test
that you can do for this and i'm going
to put a link down below of a video i
did on it
to find out if you have this mutation
but if you do
there's a certain protocol that you're
going to take and i put this data in the
video down below
one thing you take methyl b12 and
another thing you would take is
pholinic acid which is the active form
of
folate so if you just happen to have
this genetic mutation that could be
affecting your mood and
no matter how many b vitamins that you
take you're just not going to feel any
better
so anyway if you have any of these
conditions go ahead and try this
and comment down below thanks for
watching

about a product or

hi guys I want to create a little video on a question that someone had on what
is SAMe it's called s-adenosyl methionine all
right so there's really three main things this compound
improves one is your mood and that's because it's this natural compound is
used to build hormones and neurotransmitters like dopamine
serotonin gaba things like that and so it actually will help reduce addictions
addictions alcohol drugs it's good for depression it's good for focus attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder because it improves all these these
neurotransmitters it's also good for your joints so it reduces inflammation
but many people take this for improving liver function if you have a damaged
liver or you have let's say that hepatitis knew this constant
inflammation of the liver or a fatty liver or a cirrhotic liver with a scar
tissue or they're an alcoholic this is what you want to take because it repairs
the damage of the liver so it also will increase glutathione which is a very
powerful antioxidant that basically slows down the cellular damage in the
body so this compound will increase this compound and its software base so guess
where you get it cruciferous vegetables okay thanks for watching hi guys hey

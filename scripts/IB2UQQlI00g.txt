let's talk about the number one antidote
to allergies okay now whether you have
allergies
or food sensitivities
let's talk about how you can actually
get rid of those but what is the
difference between a true allergy and a
food sensitivity well there's several
things that are uh different with each
one a true allergy
involves a protein but with a food
sensitivity many times there is a
delayed reaction okay so you eat this
certain thing
and you don't feel any difference for
about two
to six hours later
sometimes
even up to 72 hours
later and this makes it very very
difficult
to connect the dots
because it can show up in a headache it
can show up in a mood change like
depression
it can show up in fatigue it can show up
as
crohn's or some type of inflammation in
your gut
it can show up in your skin as eczema
or it can show up in your joints as
arthritis but if you wanted to figure
out what food sensitivities you have
you can get what's called an igg test
which basically it's it's a type of
antibody
test but with food sensitivities there's
more of a generalized discomfort usually
not a severe symptom but with food
allergies there's more of a severe
inflammatory symptom or even a very uh
life-threatening situation where you
have an anaphylactic shock so the
question is how do you deal with these
is there a non-drug
safe
antidote or remedy for allergies or food
sensitivities now there definitely is
a very valid uh form of uh therapy is
just the elimination diet right you
figure out what you are sensitive to and
then you avoid that for a period of time
and then sometimes it can even go away
but there's something even more powerful
than that i want to touch on
now you have to realize that
allergies originate in your gut
something happens with the permeability
in your gut so you start to get a leaky
gut which is just the tight junctions in
your gut start to open up and then some
of these particles whether it's a
protein or other particles can
get through that little barrier
and then your immune system can react to
it and then you start developing
antibodies to this specific
particle or food and it gets really
confusing because
let's say you have a peanut allergy
the protein in peanuts is very similar
to almonds so you may have a true almond
allergy that can also show up as a
peanut allergy so i'm not going to get
in that complexity now because what i'm
going to talk about is how just to
improve your immune system to the point
where you don't have allergies anymore
so
the antidote to allergies
is called
autophagy it's a condition where your
body is eliminating proteins that you
don't need anymore because they're
somewhat damaged it is a survival
mechanism that your body has been using
for a very very long time
to help protect you against various
things
because if there's
some type of defect or impairment
with this
normal autophagy condition and then
these proteins can exist and create a
lot of problems for people there's been
a direct link between impairments in
autophagy and alzheimer's disease
parkinson's disease
lung fibrosis
and a whole list of other problems so
this is a very important
normal process that goes on in our body
it's your body's way of dealing with
a lot of damaged things like even damage
within your dna or damage within the
mitochondria which can create a lot of
problems and even increase your risk for
cancer
and autophagy is also an anti-aging
process because as you age autophagy can
come in there and help clean up some of
the old damaged proteins that need to be
removed
giving you not just a useful look
but better functioning body and
autophagy can even decrease
infections it can remove um
long-standing viruses from your body
like epstein-barr virus
human
papilloma virus
and other pathogens that shouldn't be in
your body so autophagy is a really good
thing but as far as allergies go there's
a lot of great data on this which i'm
going to put the links down below
that you can increase the expression of
autophagy to help decrease allergies so
the research i'm going to supply you
shows that you can decrease allergies
sensitivities
histamine levels levels of igg which are
basically the antibodies that are
involved in sensitivities autophagy can
repair the immune system it can rebuild
your immune system it can enhance
the immune defense system and it can
reduce pulmonary inflammation
so now the big question is how do we
increase autophagy in the body and
there's several things you can do the
most powerful one
is
fasting okay
fasting is the most powerful stimulus of
a topogene
now what i would recommend if you have
allergies is i would start doing
intermittent
fasting immediately and do that on a
regular basis okay that alone just might
eliminate your allergies
especially as you increase your fasting
window okay to like 18 hours or maybe 20
hours
or even getting on one meal a day but
there's some additional things you can
do that will take you to the next level
and that would be to do
periodic prolonged fasting okay so let's
say every month or every two weeks you
do a 48 hour fast for every month you do
a 72 hour fast
you're going to make a serious dent into
any problem with your immune system to
the fact where that alone might handle
your allergies but you're going to find
over time your allergies will be less
and less and less and less
and the cool thing about fasting is it
will drop inflammation so even if you
have allergies you'll have a heck of a
lot less inflammation
and not to mention that about 70 to 80
percent of your immune system is located
in your gut
and fasting does wonders for your gut
because you don't eat and it allows the
gut a chance to heal
as well as
improve the diversity and the strength
of the microbiome
i don't know if you knew this or not but
your microbiome the friendly bacteria in
your gut
greatly help modulate or control your
immune system so anything you can do to
improve the microbes is going to help
you reduce allergies
in fact babies who experience the
c-section
are at much greater risk of getting
allergies than that children that have
the normal birthing process because they
weren't exposed to the friendly bacteria
that the mother would normally give a
child and the next thing is regular or
consistent exercise can greatly improve
autophagy
green tea can help stimulate autophagy
and turmeric and other similar herbs can
also stimulate and boost
autophagy all right so now there are
other things that can also lessen
allergies that i would recommend adding
to
fasting okay
probiotics taking probiotics on a
regular basis
since 80 of your immune system is your
microbiome
taking probiotics can greatly greatly
reduce allergies
i would recommend taking your probiotics
right before bed okay the third thing is
vitamin d treat what's unique about
vitamin d is that it helps to
suppress
uh immune reactions without suppressing
the immune system that's why they use
vitamin d in something like uh the
cytokine storm where there's this this
uncontrollable inflammatory reaction or
hypersensitivity so vitamin d is really
really important and i would take um no
less than 10 000 iu's every single day
or more probably 20 000 ius or even 30
000 i use depending on the severity of
the allergy there's some great data
which i'll put a link down below that
shows that the development of an allergy
occurs when someone has a zinc
deficiency so taking zinc would be a
very logical thing to do
now the question is how do i do fasting
okay is there a good way well i just
happen to have a video on that check it
out i put it right here
